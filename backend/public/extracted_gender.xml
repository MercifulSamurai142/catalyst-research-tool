Our
 
Motivation
 
and
 
Capability
 
Statement
 
1.1
 
Motivation
 
 
For
 
the
 
past
 
three
 
decades,
 
CMS
 
has
 
delivered
 
research
 
and
 
evaluation
 
with
 
a
 
commitment
 
towards
 
capturing
 
and
 
presenting
 
evidence-based
 
decision-making
 
and
 
informed
 
development.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As
 
a
 
responsible
 
and
 
dedicated
 
knowledge
 
organisation,
 
CMS
 
is
 
uniquely
 
positioned
 
to
 
conduct
 
comprehensive
 
program
 
evaluations
 
tailored
 
to
 
developmental
 
initiatives
 
that
 
positively
 
impact
 
vulnerable
 
families,
 
particularly
 
those
 
led
 
by
 
women
 
cotton
 
farmers.
 
 
 
Our
 
commitment
 
extends
 
to
 
collaborating
 
with
 
100
 
million
 
families
 
from
 
vulnerable
 
populations
 
facing
 
socio-economic
 
challenges,
 
actively
 
striving
 
for
 
their
 
empowerment
 
and
 
upliftment.
 
 
 
Moreover,
 
we
 
are
 
deeply
 
committed
 
to
 
partnering
 
with
 
women
 
cotton
 
cultivators,
 
acknowledging
 
the
 
pivotal
 
role
 
of
 
cotton
 
as
 
a
 
symbol
 
of
 
sustainability
 
and
 
its
 
contribution
 
to
 
environmental
 
restoration.
 
 
Drawing
 
from
 
our
 
extensive
 
experience
 
in
 
this
 
ﬁeld,
 
we
 
possess
 
a
 
profound
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
intricate
 
relationship
 
between
 
cotton
 
cultivation
 
and
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
it
 
supports,
 
especially
 
those
 
of
 
women
 
farmers.
 
With
 
this
 
insight,
 
we
 
aspire
 
to
 
deepen
 
our
 
engagement
 
and
 
make
 
meaningful
 
contributions
 
to
 
improving
 
the
 
lives
 
of
 
women
 
cultivators.
 
As
 
fervent
 
advocates
 
of
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goals,
 
we
 
remain
 
steadfast
 
in
 
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
advancing
 
these
 
global
 
objectives.
 
Cotton
 
cultivation,
 
in
 
particular,
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
cornerstone
 
in
 
supporting
 
biodiversity
 
and
 
preserving
 
soil
 
fertility,
 
essential
 
elements
 
for
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices.
 
Through
 
our
 
initiatives
 
and
 
collaborations,
 
CMS
 
endeavours
 
not
 
only
 
to
 
promote
 
sustainable
 
agricultural
 
methods
 
but
 
also
 
to
 
nurture
 
a
 
resilient
 
and
 
thriving
 
ecosystem
 
that
 
beneﬁts
 
both
 
the
 
environment
 
and
 
the
 
communities,
 
with
 
a
 
special
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
women
 
leading
 
cotton
 
cultivation
 
efforts.

2.1.3.
 
Scope
 
of
 
the
 
Study
 
 
The
 
study
 
entails
 
conducting
 
a
 
baseline
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
GIF-funded
 
women's
 
participation
 
projects.
 
This
 
assessment
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
benchmark
 
for
 
evaluating
 
project
 
success
 
by
 
2027
 
and
 
supports
 
adjustments
 
to
 
the
 
project
 
and
 
monitoring
 
plans
 
for
 
the
 
forthcoming
 
season
 
by
 
AKRSPI
 
and
 
Lupin.
 
While
 
both
 
project
 
partners
 
will
 
conduct
 
internal
 
baselines
 
using
 
existing
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation,
 
and
 
Learning
 
(MEL)
 
systems,
 
the
 
objective
 
is
 
to
 
deepen
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
baseline
 
situation
 
and
 
improve
 
future
 
monitoring
 
activities.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
aim
 
is
 
to
 
contribute
 
to
 
reﬁning
 
the
 
assessment
 
of
 
empowerment
 
throughout
 
project
 
implementation.

Study
 
Approach
 
 
The
 
aim
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
conduct
 
a
 
baseline
 
survey
 
in
 
Gujarat
 
and
 
Maharashtra
 
across
 
women
 
cotton
 
farmers
 
to
 
understand
 
their
 
degree
 
of
 
empowerment
 
owing
 
to
 
the
 
efforts
 
of
 
Lupin
 
and
 
AKRSP
 
activities
 
in
 
the
 
districts.
 
Both
 
the
 
partners
 
have
 
a
 
common
 
objective
 
of
 
supporting
 
women
 
to
 
increase
 
their
 
adoption
 
of
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices,
 
increase
 
their
 
income
 
and
 
to
 
impress
 
upon
 
the
 
community
 
the
 
pivotal
 
role
 
played
 
by
 
women
 
in
 
farming.
 
 
The
 
baseline
 
study
 
will
 
thoroughly
 
evaluate
 
women's
 
empowerment,
 
utilising
 
methods
 
beyond
 
solely
 
relying
 
on
 
women's
 
self-reported
 
feelings
 
or
 
decision-making
 
through
 
the
 
conventional
 
Likert
 
scale,
 
ensuring
 
a
 
more
 
inclusive
 
and
 
detailed
 
assessment,
 
enabling
 
women
 
to
 
express
 
themselves
 
fully
 
without
 
limitations.
 
For
 
this
 
purpose,
 
the
 
study
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
mixed
 
methods
 
approach
 
because
 
it
 
focuses
 
on
 
both
 
quantitative
 
data,
 
such
 
as
 
changes
 
in
 
income
 
and
 
savings,
 
and
 
qualitative
 
data,
 
such
 
as
 
understanding
 
their
 
inﬂuence
 
in
 
decision-making
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
The
 
proposed
 
approach
 
will
 
follow
 
a
 
logical
 
ﬂow
 
-
 
reviewing
 
documents
 
-
 
problem
 
statement,
 
project
 
objectives,
 
etc.,
 
develop
 
a
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change,
 
and
 
capture
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
women
 
empowerment
 
through
 
various
 
participatory
 
tools.
 
 
The
 
framework
 
below
 
lists
 
down
 
the
 
tools
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
study,
 
the
 
drivers
 
and
 
barriers,
 
along
 
with
 
recommendations
 
and

Reviewing
 
of
 
existing
 
documents
 
&amp;
 
developing
 
a
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change:
 
 
It
 
is
 
understood
  
from
 
the
 
ToR
 
that
 
both
 
the
 
partners,
 
Lupin
 
&amp;
 
AKRSPI
 
have
 
an
 
established
 
MEL
 
system
 
in
 
place.
 
As
 
a
 
ﬁrst
 
step,
 
CMS
 
will
 
ﬁrst
 
review
 
the
 
programme
 
partner
 
logframe
 
/
 
MEL
 
plans
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
existing
 
project
 
documents
 
to
 
gain
 
clarity
 
on
 
the
 
current
 
baseline
 
situation.
 
If
 
felt
 
necessary,
 
CMS
 
will
 
suggest
 
areas
 
of
 
improvements
 
/
 
strengthening
 
in
 
the
 
existing
 
program
 
monitoring
 
processes.
 
CMS
 
has
 
developed
 
a
 
program
 
theory
 
of
 
change
 
to
 
gain
 
a
 
clear
 
picture
 
of
 
how
 
to
 
achieve
 
the
 
program
 
objectives
 
and
 
drive
 
meaningful
 
impact.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
annexure
.
 
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
commence
 
only
 
after
 
understanding
 
the
 
program
 
in
 
depth
 
and
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
approving
 
the
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change.
 
Insights
 
emerging
 
from
 
the
 
quantitative
 
and
 
mainly
 
qualitative
 
data
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
validate
 
and
 
establish
 
the
 
pathways
 
of
 
change
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
worked
 
out.
 
 
Development
 
of
 
Quantitative
 
&amp;
 
Qualitative
 
Tools:
 
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
study
 
will
 
adopt
 
a
 
mixed
 
methods
 
approach,
 
the
 
tools
 
developed
 
will
 
aim
 
at
 
capturing
 
quantitative
 
data
 
and
 
qualitative
 
insights
 
from
 
the
 
women
 
farmers.
 
For
 
the
 
quantitative
 
survey,
 
we
 
will
 
primarily
 
use
 
the
 
indicators
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
Delta
 
Women’s
 
Empowerment
 
tool
 
for
 
capturing
 
data
 
and
 
insights
 
on
 
sustainability
 
practices
 
and
 
income
 
/
 
productivity
 
of
 
women
 
farmers.
 
The
 
KPIs
 
listed
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
TOC
 
have
 
been
 
developed
 
keeping
 
in
 
view
 
the
 
indicators
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
Delta
 
Framework.
 
 
During
 
the
 
questionnaire
 
design
 
process,
 
utmost
 
care
 
will
 
be
 
taken
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
questions
 
are
 
framed
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
that
 
allows
 
women
 
to
 
self-assess
 
their
 
empowerment,
 
identify
 
barriers,
 
and
 
recognize
 
opportunities
 
for
 
empowerment.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
design
 
will
 
prioritise
 
enabling
 
women
 
to
 
freely
 
express
 
their
 
feelings
 
without
 
being
 
limited
 
by
 
the
 
tool's
 
constraints
 
on
 
word
 
usage
 
or
 
any
 
other
 
factor.

their
 
views
 
on
 
women
 
assuming
 
leadership
 
roles
 
in
 
their
 
FPOs.
 
 
Questions
 
will
 
be
 
designed
 
to
 
get
 
an
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
baseline

Understanding
 
the
 
viewpoints
 
of
 
the
 
family
 
and
 
community
 
members
 
surrounding
 
empowered
 
women
 
is
 
vital
 
for
 
gaining
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
broader
 
social
 
dynamics
 
and
 
support
 
systems
 
that
 
inﬂuence
 
women's
 
empowerment
 
initiatives.
 
By
 
engaging
 
with
 
family
 
members,
 
CMS
 
aims
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
holistic
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
context
 
in
 
which
 
empowered
 
women
 
live,
 
thereby
 
strengthening
 
our
 
ability
 
to
 
suggest
 
empowerment
 
indicators
 
for
 
the
 
study.
 
 
During
 
the
 
FGDs
 
/
 
KIIs,
 
CMS
 
will
 
capture
 
case-studies,
 
success
 
stories
 
and
 
best
 
practices.
 
 
We
 
understand
 
that
 
during
 
the
 
qualitative
 
survey,
 
the
 
CMS's
 
core
 
team
 
will
 
be
 
assisted
 
with
 
staff
 
from
 
Lupin
 
and
 
AKRSPI
 
as
 
rapport
 
with
 
local
 
women
 
and
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
local
 
context
 
will
 
be
 
needed.
 
Additionally,
 
it
 
will
 
also
 
help
 
the
 
partner
 
staff
 
in
 
understanding
 
the
 
conceptualisation
 
of
 
women
 
empowerment
 
and
 
project
 
indicators.

The
 
analytical
 
framework
 
would
 
be
 
focussed
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
key
 
narratives
 
and
 
drivers
 
to
 
establish
 
the
 
following:
 
1)
 
Uptake
 
of
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
by
 
women
 
 
2)
 
Increase
 
in
 
their
 
income

3)
 
Improvement
 
in
 
community
 
recognition
 
of
 
the
 
pivotal
 
role
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
farming
 
We
 
will
 
achieve
 
the
 
above
 
objectives
 
through
 
mixed
 
methods
 
analysis
 
of
 
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
analytical
 
approaches.
 
 
○
 
Quantitative
 
analysis
 
-
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
collected
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level
 
will
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
advanced
 
statistical
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
STATA.
 
All
 
analyses
 
will
 
be
 
carried
 
out
 
in
 
stages.
 
At
 
ﬁrst,
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as
 
mean,
 
median,
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
quartile
 
or
 
decile
 
distribution
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
along
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
to
 
measure
 
KPIs.
 
Then
 
as
 
a
 
second
 
step,
 
causality
 
would
 
be
 
established
 
using
 
evaluation
 
methods
 
as
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
methodology
 
adopted
 
for
 
this
 
evaluation.
 
This
 
will
 
provide
 
impact
 
estimates
 
for
 
the
 
program.
 
 
○
 
Qualitative
 
analysis
 
-
 
The
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
(FGDs
 
/
 
KIIs)
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
would
 
provide
 
insight
 
into
 
the
 
practices
 
seen
 
on
 
the
 
ground
 
vis-a-vis
 
the
 
responses
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
assessment.
 
We
 
will
 
prepare
 
thematic
 
coding
 
to
 
identify
 
patterns
 
in
 
data
 
and
 
draw
 
narratives
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
triangulate
 
the
 
inferences
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data.
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
analyse
 
the
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collected
 
through
 
the
 
KIIs
 
using
 
software
 
such
 
as

will
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
identify
 
the

3.4
 
Endline
 
Evaluation
 
Methodology
 
 
In
 
the

assessment,
 
we
 
will
 
analyse
 
the
 
indicators
 
identiﬁed
 
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
to
 
determine
 
changes
 
over
 
time
 
and
 
assess
 
attribution
 
and
 
contribution.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
will
 
examine
 
external
 
factors,
 
including
 
enablers
 
and
 
barriers,
 
that
 
may
 
have
 
inﬂuenced
 
outcomes.
 
Recommendations
 
for
 
sustainability
 
and
 
scalability,
 
along
 
with
 
strategies
 
for
 
mitigating
 
external
 
factors,
 
will
 
be
 
crucial.
 
We
 
will
 
adhere
 
to
 
a
 
similar
 
analytical
 
framework
 
as
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
study.
 
The
 
ToC
 
will
 
be
 
evaluated
 
by
 
CMS
 
to
 
ascertain
 
its
 
effectiveness,
 
including
 
the
 
validity
 
of
 
causal
 
and
 
implementation
 
assumptions
 
and
 
whether
 
the
 
identiﬁed

Conﬁdentiality
 
and
 
Ethical
 
Considerations
 
Ensuring
 
anonymity
 
and
 
protecting
 
respondent
 
identity
 
is
 
a
 
mandatory
 
requirement,
 
and
 
our
 
organisation
 
adheres
 
to
 
stringent
 
protocols
 
for
 
maintaining
 
the
 
highest
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdentiality.
 
We
 
have
 
implemented
 
robust
 
measures
 
to
 
safeguard
 
data
 
security
 
and
 
privacy
 
across
 
our
 
digital
 
tools
 
and
 
platforms,
 
including
 
encryption
 
of
 
survey
 
forms
 
and
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
for
 
enumerators
 
on
 
data
 
sharing,
 
accompanied
 
by
 
conﬁdentiality
 
contracts.
 
Our
 
enumerators
 
undergo
 
comprehensive
 
training
 
to
 
remain
 
unbiased
 
and
 
refrain
 
from
 
sharing
 
any
 
personal
 
opinions,
 
claims,
 
or
 
identifying
 
information.
 
They
 
are
 
bound
 
by
 
a
 
conﬁdentiality
 
agreement
 
with
 
CMS,
 
committing
 
to
 
the
 
proper
 
use
 
of
 
conﬁdential
 
information
 
solely
 
for
 
the
 
designated
 
purposes
 
outlined
 
in
 
their
 
training,
 
and
 
not
 
disclosing
 
it
 
to
 
any
 
third
 
party.
 
Additionally,
 
our
 
enumerators
 
are
 
instructed
 
not
 
to
 
copy,
 
retain,
 
or
 
share
 
any
 
written
 
information
 
that
 
could
 
potentially
 
reveal
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
individuals,
 
and
 
all
 
conﬁdential
 
information,
 
such
 
as
 
questionnaires,
 
notes,
 
photographs,
 
and
 
memoranda,
 
is
 
handed
 
over
 
to
 
the
 
team
 
upon
 
the
 
conclusion
 
of
 
the
 
surveys.

Quality
 
Control
 
Mechanism
 
With
 
over
 
200
 
projects
 
and
 
an
 
in-house
 
portfolio
 
for
 
data
 
collection,
 
CMS
 
has
 
strong
 
expertise
 
in
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
This
 
becomes
 
especially
 
relevant
 
in
 
the
 
post
 
pandemic
 
scenario
 
wherein
 
the
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
following
 
stringent
 
guidelines
 
around
 
safety
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
following
 
international
 
standards.
 
 
After
 
the
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
ﬁnalised
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
the
 
GIF
 
team
 
,
 
researchers
 
from
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
will
 
conduct
 
a
 
pilot
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
well
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
location,
 
project
 
context
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
cultural
 
point
 
of
 
view.
 
Once
 
the
 
post-pilot
 
changes
 
are
 
completed,
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
scripted
 
and
 
tested
 
in-house
 
(for
 
skips
 
and
 
validations)
 
by
 
researchers
 
and
 
tested
 
in
 
a
 
setting
 
similar
 
to
 
that
 
of
 
the
 
intended
 
sample.
 
Th
e
 
ﬁnal
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
translated
 
into
 
local
 
language
 
by
 
experienced
 
thematic
 
translators
 
to
 
retain
 
the
 
essence
 
and
 
yet
 
contextualise
 
for
 
the
 
local
 
language.
 
Translated
 
tools
 
undergo
 
a
 
proofreading
 
exercise
 
to
 
check
 
the
 
consistency
 
and
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
translation
 
by
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
who
 
is
 
well
 
versed
 
in
 
local
 
languages.
 
Monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Poor
 
quality
 
data
 
reduces
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
policy
 
intervention,
 
and
 
can
 
also
 
require
 
a
 
repeat
 
of
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring

Data
 
management
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
yet
 
often
 
overlooked
 
aspect
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
has
 
strong
 
experience
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
multiple
 
scripting
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Survey
 
CTO,
 
Commcare,
 
ODK,
 
etc.
 
and
 
experience
 
in
 
online
 
data
 
management.
 
Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
data
 
cleaning.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
validation
 
exercise
 
is
 
completed
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
post-cleaning
 
efforts
 
including
 
id
 
variable
 
checking,
 
outlier
 
tagging,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
replacements,
 
illogical
 
value
 
assessment,
 
addressing
 
typos,
 
survey
 
codes,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
adding
 
labels.
 
Irregularities
 
and
 
corrections
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
documented,
 
but
 
changes
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
after
 
introspection
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
insights.

Key Insights from Recce Visit (1/1) 
● Centre Operations and Stakeholders: Trainers, placement ofﬁcers, administrative staff and leadership contributing to the operational 
efﬁciency and skill-building focus of the centers 
● Training Practices:  Foundational and technical training offered across domains like healthcare, IT, logistics, entrepreneurship. Practical and 
theoretical components, internships, and live projects to enhance technical skills and workplace readiness 
● Mobilisation and Outreach: Door-to-door campaigns, community partnerships, and alumni involvement. Family engagement was 
prioritised to address cultural barriers, particularly for women, enhancing inclusivity and enrollment 
● Data and Records Management: Systems included CRM software and manual registers to track admissions, attendance, and placements. 
However, challenges such as incomplete dropout tracking and data inconsistencies were identiﬁed 
● Infrastructure and Accessibility - Centers were equipped with adequate training infrastructure, such as computer labs, skill-speciﬁc 
equipment, and dedicated training spaces. However, some centers faced challenges in maintaining accessibility for trainees from remote 
areas due to limited transport options 
● Stakeholder Collaboration - Good collaboration with local industries and employers facilitated on-the-job training opportunities and direct 
placement pipelines. Regular feedback loops with employers were used to align with evolving industry demands. 
● Trainee Support Systems - Centers offered career counselling, mentorship, and peer support groups to boost trainee conﬁdence and career 
clarity 
The reconnaissance visit covered  13  facilities,  4 were SMART Academies, and 9 were SMART centres, engaging                           
256 stakeholders, including staff, students, and alumni. APD was the only SMART Plus Centre visited. 

Key Insights from Recce Visit (1/2) 
● T arget Populations:  The program mostly serves youth aged 18–30 from economically weaker sections, women (including married 
and women with disability), and differently-abled individuals, including those with Speech and Hearing Impairments 
● Employment Status and Livelihoods: Participants were from households dependent on daily wage labour or informal sector jobs,  
emphasising the program’s importance in creating sustainable and upward mobility for families 
● Geographic Reach: Beneﬁciaries hail from urban, peri-urban, and rural areas, with notable representation from regions like 
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and T elangana 
● Socio cultural challenges: Stakeholders included women and youth from patriarchal communities where cultural norms often  
restrict mobility and career opportunities. Customised outreach and ﬂexible training schedules were employed to address these  
barr iers and encourage participation 
● Gender Representation:  In last 3 years, female enrollment varied across centres, ranging from 40% at Noida Deaf Society to 57% 
at APSA-Hyderabad, 34% at SMART Academy for Digital T echnology in Hyderabad, and 100% at Bandra Healthcare Academy. T o 
further enhance female participation, initiatives such as scholarships and a 50% course fee waiver are being implemented 
● Economic Accessibility: Course fees ranged from Rs 500 to  Rs 18,000, but were not strictly implemented in all centers, with 
scholarships available for underprivileged students to improve accessibility and reduce dropout rates 


Success Stories 
Smart Centre - Jamia Nagar (Delhi) 
A 30-year-old widow, facing the challenges of raising two children alone after her husband's death, 
struggled to make ends meet. Her persistence and determination to join the digital marketing course 
despite her circumstances motivated the centre staff to support her admission. With her newly 
acquired skills, she now works as a freelance content creator, earning enough to support her family 
independently. Her story reﬂects resilience and the power of education to transform lives. 
Smart Plus Centre- Association of People with Disability (Bangalore) 
A young woman from a four-member family in North Karnataka, has a locomotor disability and faced 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial challenges. Her family's situation worsened four years ago when her father suffered a 
debilitating stroke, leaving him permanently paralyzed. This forced her younger brother, then only 15, to 
drop out of school and take up menial jobs to support the household. In 2023, she enrolled in the BPO 
course at the SMART Plus Centre run by APD. Upon completing the course, she secured a position with 
Vindhya Infomedia. Now earning a stable income, she feels ﬁnancially empowered and is able to contribute 
to her family's well-being. The course has not only improved her economic condition but has also 
signiﬁcantly boosted her conﬁdence.

One young woman, with no prior knowledge of computers, joined the SMART program in 
Mumbai, driven by her aspirations to secure a better career. Coming from a family where 
her mother worked as a nurse and her older sister missed the chance to pursue a career, 
she was determined to create her own path. After completing the program, she secured a 
job as an HR professional at Ocean 1, earning Rs17,000 monthly. The program not only 
equipped her with technical skills but also signiﬁcantly boosted her conﬁdence, enabling 
her to engage effectively in her professional role. 
APSA-T ech Mahindra Smart Center (Hyderabad) 
At 24, a determined young Muslim woman from Warsiguda, Hyderabad, is transforming her and her 
family’s lives. Coming from a lower-middle-class background with her father as an auto driver, she 
enrolled in the ITES/BPO course at APSA, mastering Excel, MS Ofﬁce, T ally, and communication skills. 
Her efforts led to a Process Executive role at Cognizant, working on a Google project in Gachibowli. 
Despite challenges like night shifts, her father’s unconditional support has helped her excel, bringing 
pride and ﬁnancial stability to her family. Embracing corporate life, she aspires to advance her career and 
uplift her family’s future.

Process of Empowerment 
Employability 
The SMART program builds job 
capacity, readiness, and networks 
to improve employability. It 
equips women with skills that 
enhance their mobility, earning 
potential, and social capital. 
Empowerment 
Comprehensive empowerment 
requires systemic changes 
beyond immediate outcomes, 
addressing gender norms, family 
dynamics, and societal structures 
to enable resilience, strategic life 
choices, and well-being. 
Economic 
Empowerment 
Employability leads to increased 
income, mobility, access to 
income, decision-making power, 
and conﬁdence, contributing to 
economic empowerment. 
03 
01 02 
Through the programme, while we can envisage improvements in 
employability and economic empowerment; a change in overall 
empowerment is dependent on ecosystem level factors, along with some 
personal and relational determinants which would not be within the 
programmes direct inﬂuence.

Deﬁnition
 
of
 
Women
 
Empowerment
 
 
Women
 
empowerment
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
wide
 
subject
 
of
 
study
 
and
 
various
 
studies
 
have
 
given
 
different
 
perspectives
 
to
 
the
 
deﬁnition
 
of
 
women
 
empowerment.
 
 
 
As
 
per
 
the
 
UNESCWA
 
(
United
 
Nations
 
Economic
 
and
 
Social
 
Commission
 
for
 
Western
 
Asia
)
 
,
 
Women
 
empowerment
 
is
 
the
 
process
 
by
 
which
 
women
 
become
 
aware
 
of
 
gender-based
 
unequal
 
power
 
relationships
 
and
 
acquire
 
a
 
greater
 
voice
 
in
 
which
 
to
 
speak
 
out
 
against
 
the
 
inequality
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
home,
 
workplace,
 
and
 
community.
 
It
 
involves
 
women
 
taking
 
control
 
over
 
their
 
lives:
 
setting
 
their
 
own
 
agendas,
 
gaining
 
skills,
 
solving
 
problems,
 
and
 
developing
 
self-reliance
4
.
 
It
 
encompasses
 
facilitation
 
of
 
economic,
 
social,
 
psychological
 
and
 
political
 
empowerment
 
of
 
women
 
and
 
girls
 
to
 
promote
 
women’s
 
economic
 
independence,
 
improve
 
relationships
 
and
 
promote
 
equitable
 
gender
 
power
 
relations
 
within
 
households,
 
communities
 
and
 
society
5
.
 
 
 
Women's
 
empowerment
 
is
 
about
 
the
 
process
 
by
 
which
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
been
 
denied
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
make
 
strategic
 
life
 
choices
 
acquire
 
such
 
an
 
ability.
 
The
 
process
 
through
 
which
 
individuals
 
gain
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
make
 
choices
 
and
 
transform
 
these
 
choices
 
into
 
desired
 
actions
 
and
 
outcomes.
 
For
 
women,
 
this
 
involves
 
overcoming
 
barriers
 
imposed
 
by
 
societal
 
norms,
 
economic
 
constraints,
 
and
 
patriarchal
 
systems
 
(Kabeer,
 
Naila).
 
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
perspectives
 
of
 
women’s
 
empowerment
 
is
 
to
 
promote
 
the
 
equal
 
position
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
world
 
of
 
work,
 
and
 
to
 
further
 
that
 
aim
 
at
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
levels
 
by:
 
(a)
 
Promoting
 
capacity
 
building
 
of
 
women
 
to
 
enable
 
them
 
to
 
participate
 
equally
 
in
 
all
 
societal
 
activities
 
and
 
decision-making
 
at
 
all
 
levels;
 
(b)
 
Promoting
 
equal
 
access
 
to
 
and
 
control
 
over
 
resources
 
and
 
the
 
beneﬁts
 
of
 
productive,
 
reproductive,
 
and
 
community
 
activities
 
by
 
afﬁrmative
 
action
 
for
 
women;
 
(c)
 
Working
 
to
 
achieve
 
equality
 
and
 
safe
 
and
 
respectful
 
working
 
conditions;
 
(d)
 
Promoting
 
and
 
strengthening
 
the
 
capacity
 
of

development
 
organisations
 
to
 
act
 
in
 
favour
 
of

and

(e)
 
Promoting
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
socio-economic
 
conditions
 
in

6
.
 
It
 
is

Goal

Empowerment
 
happens
 
by
 
removing
 
constraints
 
that
 
impede
 
women’s
 
and
 
girls’
 
ability
 
to
 
determine
 
and
 
realize
 
their
 
goals.
 
These
 
constraints
 
can
 
be
 
classiﬁed
 
into
 
three
 
pillars:
 
●
 
Constraints
 
in
 
Agency
 
–
 
the
 
capacity
 
for
 
goal-setting
 
and
 
follow-through,
 
indicative
 
of
 
their
 
level
 
of
 
self-efﬁcacy
 
and
 
self-esteem.
 
●
 
Constraints
 
in
 
Resources
 
–
 
the
 
inputs
 
(such
 
as
 
capital,
 
assets,
 
tools,
 
and
 
information)
 
that
 
individuals
 
have
 
at
 
their
 
disposal
 
to
 
enable
 
decision-making
 
and
 
actions
 
to
 
achieve
 
their
 
goals.
 
●
 
Context/ecosystem
–
 
an
 
enabling
 
environment
 
for
 
equitable
 
decision-making,
 
including
  
institutions
 
and
 
social
 
arrangements.
 
Addressing
 
constraints
 
across
 
these
 
pillars
 
can
 
empower
 
women
 
to
 
realize
 
speciﬁc
 
achievements,
 
leading
 
to
 
gender
 
equality.
 
2.2
 
Women
 
Empowerment
 
and
 
Female
 
Participation
 
in
 
the
 
Workforce
 
 
Female
 
Participation
 
in
 
the
 
workforce
 
plays
 
a
 
pivotal
 
role
 
in
 
achieving
 
women's
 
empowerment.
 
By
 
engaging
 
in
 
economic
 
activities,
 
women
 
gain
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence,
 
decision-making
 
power,
 
and
 
societal
 
recognition,
 
which
 
collectively
 
contribute
 
to
 
their
 
empowerment
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
development
 
of
 
societies.
 
F
emale
 
labour
 
force
 
participation
 
rate
 
(FLPR)
 
is
 
a
 
driver
 
of
 
growth
 
and
 
therefore,
 
participation
 
rates
 
indicate
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
a
 
country
 
to
 
grow
 
more
 
rapidly.
 
However,
 
the
 
relationship
 
between
 
women’s
 
engagement
 
in
 
the
 
labour
 
market
 
and
 
broader
 
development
 
outcomes
 
is
 
complex
7
.
 
The
 
participation
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
labour
 
force
 
varies
 
considerably
 
across
 
developing
 
countries
 
and
 
emerging
 
economies,
 
far
 
more
 
than
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
men.
 
In
 
the
 
Middle
 
East,
 
North
 
Africa
 
and
 
South
 
Asia,
 
less
 
than
 
one-third
 
of
 
women
 
of
 
working-age
 
participate,
 
while
 
the
 
proportion
 
reaches
 
around
 
two-thirds
 
in
 
East
 
Asia
 
and
 
sub-Saharan
 
Africa.
 
This
 
variation
 
is
 
driven
 
by
 
a
 
wide
 
variety
 
of
 
economic
 
and
 
social
 
factors
 
including
 
economic
 
growth,
 
increasing
 
educational
 
attainment,
 
falling
 
fertility
 
rates
 
and
 
social
 
norms.
 
Besides
 
labour
 
market
 
gender
 
gaps
 
are
 
more
 
pronounced
 
in
 
developing
 
countries,
 
and
 
disparity
 
is
 
highest
 
in
 
South
 
Asian
 
countries
 
 
The
 
participation
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
labour
 
market
 
are
 
primarily
 
driven
 
by
 
various
 
factors,
 
viz.,
 
economic
 
development,
 
education
 
levels,
 
fertility
 
rates,
 
access
 
to
 
childcare
 
and
 
other
 
supportive
 
services
 
and,
 
ultimately,
 
the
 
cultural
 
and
 
normative
 
context
 
of
 
society
 
and
 
social
 
norms.
 
These
 
factors
 
react
 
as
 
the
 
“Push
 
and
 
Pull
 
factors”
 
for
 
female
 
participation
 
in
 
employment.
 
However
 
the
 
rapid
 
economic
 
growth,
 
rising
 
education,
 
and
 
declining
 
fertility,
 
results
 
in
 
increasing
 
women
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
labour
 
force
 
but
 
women
 
face
 
barriers
 
in
 
accessing
 
economic
 
opportunities.
 
Economic
 
development
 
and
 
increasing
 
income
 
levels
 
don’t
 
seem
 
sufﬁcient
 
to
 
reduce
 
stubbornly
 
high
 
gender
 
gaps

multiple
 
dimensions

FLPR
 
is
 
a
 
multidimensional
 
agglomeration
 
of
 
structural
 
and
 
socioeconomic
 
factors.
 
Over
 
the
 
years,
 
it
 
has
 
shown
 
an
 
increasing
 
trend.
 
Encouraging
 
and
 
welcoming
 
female
 
higher
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
labour
 
force
 
is
 
vital
 
for
 
economic
 
growth.
 
The
 
latest
 
Report
 
of
 
Periodic
 
Labour
 
Force
 
Survey
 
(PLFS)
 
2021-22
 
is
 
evident
 
of
 
increased
 
FLPR
 
in
 
India.
 
Though
 
it
 
is
 
lower
 
than
 
the
 
male,
 
it
 
is
 
signiﬁcantly
 
increasing
 
over
 
the
 
years
 
and
 
at
 
present,
 
around
 
one
 
third
 
of
 
women
 
have
 
joined
 
the
 
labour
 
force.
 
 
 
It
 
is
 
evident
 
from
 
from
 
the

in

Vocational/technical
 
training
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
important
 
factor
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
labour

3.1.1
 
 
Evaluation
 
Framework:
 
Incorporating
 
a
  
gendered
 
lens
 
to
 
the
 
study
 
Keeping
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
from
 
the
 
secondary
 
literature
 
in
 
mind,
 
it
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
employ
 
a
 
gendered
 
lens
 
in
 
reexamining
 
the
 
program’s
 
theory
 
of
 
change,
 
course
 
design,
 
delivery
 
methods,
 
and
 
overall
 
impact.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
design
 
should
 
be
 
rooted
 
in
 
feminist
 
principles
12
 
while
 
accounting
 
for
 
intersectionalities
 
such
 
as
 
disability,
 
age,
 
and
 
education,
 
which
 
exacerbate
 
inequities
.
 
The
 
study
 
approach
 
is
 
detailed
 
in
 
the
 
proposal
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
annexure
.
 
As
 
discussed
 
in
 
the
 
literature
 
review
,
 
women's
 
need
 
for
 
empowerment
 
in
 
employment
 
arises
 
from
 
systemic
 
exclusion
 
and
 
gender-based
 
disparities
 
in
 
access
 
to
 
opportunities,
 
reinforced
 
by
 
social
 
norms,
 
institutional
 
biases,
 
and
 
structural
 
barriers.
 
Empowerment
 
enables
 
women
 
to
 
exercise
 
agency,
 
assert
 
their
 
rights,
 
and
 
gain
 
autonomy
 
over
 
their
 
choices.
 
Autonomy—the
 
freedom
 
to
 
make
 
choices,
 
implying
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
alternatives
 
to
 
pursue
 
decisions
 
and
 
actions
—can
 
be
 
understood
 
through
 
three
 
stages
 
of
 
social
 
change
:
 
resources,
 
agency,
 
and
 
achievements.
 
●
 
Resources
:
 
refer
 
to
 
access
13
 
to
 
economic,
 
social,
 
and
 
human
 
capital
 
necessary
 
for
 
decision-making.
  
 
●
 
Agency
:
 
involves
 
voicing
 
opinions
 
and
 
inﬂuencing
 
strategic
 
life
 
decisions,
 
shaped
 
by
 
multiple
14
  
personal
 
factors
 
(e.g.,
 
conﬁdence,
 
perceived
 
gender
 
roles,
 
self-esteem)
 
and
 
relational
 
factors
 
(e.g.,
 
family
 
perceptions
 
of
 
gender
 
roles,
 
control
 
over
 
assets,
 
household
 
support).
  
 
●
 
Achievements
:
 
are
 
the
 
positive
 
outcomes
 
resulting
 
from
 
improved
 
resource
 
access
 
and
 
enhanced
 
agency.
 
Tech
 
Mahindra
 
Foundation’s
 
SMART
 
program
 
addresses
 
these
 
stages
 
by
 
targeting
 
women
 
from
 
economically
 
disadvantaged
 
households
 
and
 
individuals
 
with
 
disabilities.
 
It
 
removes
 
barriers
 
to
 
capacity-building
 
resources
 
and
 
provides
 
placement
 
support
 
to
 
secure
 
employment.
 
The
 
program
 
enhances
 
foundational
 
skills,
 
such
 
as
 
communication,
 
technical
 
abilities,
 
and
 
a
 
future-oriented
 
vision,
 
contributing
 
to
 
participants'
 
agency
 
and
 
offering
 
better
 
choices
 
for
 
ﬁnancial
 
stability
 
and
 
independence—core
 
elements
 
of
 
empowerment.
  
The
 
program's
 
theory
 
of
 
change
 
and
 
pathways

3.1.2
  
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
need
 
for
 
this
 
program
 
and
 
its
 
multiple
 
interventions,
 
as
 
individuals
 
in
 
the
 
target
 
population—despite
 
completing
 
schooling
 
and,
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
higher
 
education—face
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenges
 
entering
 
the
 
formal
 
job
 
market.
 
These
 
challenges
 
stem
 
from
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
awareness
 
about
 
relevant
 
opportunities,
 
insufﬁcient
 
employment-related
 
skills,
 
and
 
barriers
 
to
 
accessing
 
capacity-building
 
resources.
 
The
 
historic
 
exclusion
 
of
 
women
 
and
 
people
 
with
 
disabilities
 
has
 
entrenched
 
structural
 
barriers,
 
including
 
restrictive
 
gender
 
and
 
social
 
norms,
 
inadequate
 
workplace
 
and
 
public
 
accessibility
 
infrastructure,
 
concerns
 
about
 
workplace
 
safety,
 
and
 
societal
 
expectations
 
tied
 
to
 
marriage,
 
household
 
responsibilities,
 
and
 
family
 
life.
 
Addressing
 
these
 
barriers
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
sustaining
 
long-term
 
outcomes.
 
Changes
 
in
 
societal
 
norms,
 
coupled
 
with
 
practical
 
support
 
systems
 
like
 
childcare
 
and
 
accessible
 
workplaces,
 
are
 
essential
 
to
 
advancing
 
economic
 
empowerment.
 
Insights
 
from
 
the
 
literature,
 
combined
 
with
 
pathways
 
of
 
change
 
toward
 
empowerment,
 
indicate
 
that
 
achieving
 
short-term
 
and
 
some
 
long-term
 
outcomes
 
falls
 
within
 
the
 
program’s
 
scope.
 
However,
 
realizing
 
the
 
intended
 
impact—long-term
 
empowerment
 
in
 
participants’
 
personal
 
and
 
professional
 
lives—requires
 
deeper
 
exploration
 
of
 
ecosystem-level
 
enabling
 
and
 
disabling
 
factors
 
and
 
potential
 
levers
 
for
 
fostering
 
empowerment.
 
The
 
fundamental
 
building
 
blocks
 
for
 
women’s
 
economic
 
empowerment
 
can
 
be
 
grouped
 
into
 
four
 
categories:
 
ecosystem,
 
enablers,
 
levers,
 
and
 
outcomes.
 
These
 
are
 
visualized
 
and
 
detailed
 
below.

change,
 
enabling

to
 
take
 
root.
 
Societal
 
norms
 
and
 
structural
 
systems
 
shape
 
access
 
and
 
opportunities
 
for
 
women,
 
particularly
 
those
 
with

Norms
 
related
 
to
 
marriage,
 
education,
 
and
 
work
 
often
 
restrict
 
independence
 
and
 
agency.
 
Structural
 
elements
 
like
 
accessible
 
infrastructure,
 
inclusive
 
transport,
 
workplace
 
adjustments,
 
and
 
gender-sensitive
 
policies
 
are
 
critical
 
for
 
equitable
 
participation.
 
Policies
 
such
 
as
 
pay

and
 
anti-discrimination
 
laws
 
further
 
support
 
inclusivity.

and
 
a

These
 
factors

to
 
build
 
capabilities,
 
access
 
opportunities
 
for
 
ﬁnancial

whereas
 
levers
 
focus
 
on
 
t
ranslating
 
these
 
into
 
actionable
 
outcomes,
 
such
 
as
 
employment,
 
entrepreneurship,
 
or
 
ﬁnancial
 
growth,
 
by
 
directly
 
connecting
 
individuals
 
to
 
opportunities.
 
For
 
example,
 
skill
 
development
 
programs
 
aligned
 
with
 
industry
 
needs—particularly
 
those
 
inclusive
 
of
 
women
 
with
 
disabilities—enhance
 
job
 
readiness.
 
Financial
 
tools
 
like
 
microloans
 
and
 
mentorship
 
expand
 
access
 
to
 
capital
 
and
 
networks,
 
while
 
job
 
placement
 
services
 
and
 
market-aligned
 
training
 
ensure
 
smoother
 
workforce
 
transitions.
 
These
 
levers
 
amplify
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
enablers,
 
helping
 
individuals
 
achieve
 
economic
 
stability
 
and
 
long-term
 
empowerment.
 
Outcome
 
The
 
ultimate
 
outcome
 
is
 
economic
 
empowerment,
 
characterized
 
by
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence,
 
decision-making
 
agency,
 
and
 
equitable
 
societal
 
participation.
 
This
 
empowerment
 
encompasses
 
personal
 
dimensions
 
(e.g.,
 
self-esteem
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
vocalize
 
and
 
act
 
on
 
choices)
 
and
 
social
 
dimensions
 
(
e.g.,
 
leveraging
 
social
 
networks
 
to
 
access
 
better
 
opportunities)
.
 
These
 
interconnected
 
elements
 
reinforce
 
one
 
another;
 
for
 
example,
 
earning
 
an
 
income
 
fosters
 
independence,
 
challenges
 
societal
 
perceptions,
 
and
 
strengthens
 
self-esteem.
 
Over
 
time,
 
these
 
shifts
 
contribute
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
inclusive
 
society,
 
where
 
women
 
and
 
individuals
 
with
 
disabilities
 
are
 
recognized
 
as
 
equal
 
contributors,
 
reshaping
 
the
 
ecosystem.
 
The
 
WEE
 
(Women’s
 
Economic
 
Empowerment)
 
blocks
 
visualize
 
empowerment
 
as
 
an
 
interconnected,
 
transformative
 
process.
 
Given
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
program
 
activities,
 
the
 
primary
 
focus
 
is
 
on
 
assessing
 
changes
 
in
 
economic
 
empowerment,
 
speciﬁcally
 
participants’
 
ability
 
to
 
earn
 
a
 
stable
 
income,
 
while
 
considering
 
the
 
broader
 
ecosystem's
 
impact
 
on
 
these
 
outcomes.

job
 
capacity
 
development,

channel
 
creation,
 
and
 
capital-building
 
to
 
enhance
 
employability
.
 
Employability
,
 
in
 
turn,
 
improves
 
women’s
 
mobility,
 
earning
 
potential,
 
decision-making
 
about
 
income,
 
and
 
conﬁdence,
 
while
 
building
 
social
 
capital
 
through
 
new
 
networks.
 
Together,
 
these
 
factors
 
contribute
 
to
 
economic
 
empowerment.
 
Achieving
 
deeper,
 
long-term
 
change
 
requires
 
concurrent
 
shifts
 
in
 
ecosystem-level
 
factors
 
and
 
economic
 
empowerment,
 
as
 
outcomes
 
are
 
inﬂuenced
 
by
 
the
 
environment
 
and
 
other
 
stakeholders.
 
For
 
instance
,
 
a
 
woman’s
 
household
 
decision-making
 
power
 
depends
 
not
 
only
 
on
 
her
 
earning
 
ability
 
and
 
income
 
contribution
 
but
 
also
 
on
 
gender
 
norms,
 
family
 
dynamics,
 
and
 
relationship
 
quality.
 
Similarly,
 
access
 
to
 
better
 
career
 
opportunities
 
is
 
shaped
 
by
 
policies
 
mandating
 
accommodations
 
for
 
people
 
with
 
disabilities,
 
safety
 
measures
 
for
 
women,
 
and
 
general
 
infrastructure
 
supporting
 
mobility.
 
These
 
concurrent
 
shifts
 
improve
 
equity
 
and
 
inclusion,
 
enabling
 
strategic
 
life
 
choices
 
that
 
enhance
 
resilience
 
and
 
well-being.
 
Understanding
 
the
 
layered
 
nature
 
of
 
empowerment
 
is
 
key
 
to
 
distinguishing
 
outcomes
 
directly
 
inﬂuenced
 
by
 
the
 
program
 
from
 
those
 
shaped
 
by
 
broader
 
ecosystem
 
factors.

comprehensive
 
empowerment
 
relies
 
on
 
systemic
 
changes.
 
These
 
include
 
shifts
 
in
 
gender
 
norms,
 
family
 
relationships,
 
and
 
policies
 
that
 
promote
 
equity
 
and

This

ensures

of
 
the

To

the

17
 
efﬁciently,
 
we
 
will
 
employ
 
hybrid
 
data
 
collection,
 
with
 
both
 
ﬁeld
 
and
 
telephonic
 
surveys.
 
The
 
MIS
 
data
 
collected
 
had
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
29,785
 
observations,
 
spread
 
across
 
15
 
locations
18
.
  
After
 
cleaning
 
the
 
shared
 
data
 
by
 
removing
 
duplicates
 
and
 
missing
 
values
 
in
 
mobile
 
numbers,
 
and
 
some
 
outliers
 
in
 
family
 
income,
 
we
 
have
 
data
 
for
 
27,443
 
participants
 
across
 
12
 
cities.
 
Of
 
these,
 
two
 
cities
 
-
 
Nagpur
 
and
 
Raipur
 
were
 
dropped
 
from
 
the
 
sample
 
selection
 
due
 
to
 
having
 
a
 
very
 
small
 
number
 
of
 
participants
 
in
 
the
 
overall
 
population.
 
These
 
are
 
tabulated
 
by
 
the
 
city
 
in
 
the
 
annexure.
 
To
 
capture
 
the

across
 
demographics,
 
disability

intensity,
 
etc.
 
to
 
bring
 
out
 
differences
 
in
 
impact
 
and
 
experience
 
across
 
groups.
 
 
While
 
selecting
 
the
 
sample,
 
we
 
will
 
maintain

across
 
some

Given
 
the
 
70%

rate,
 
most
 
of
 
the

might
 
be
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
ﬁnd
 
a
 
convenient
 
time
 
to
 
meet
 
in
 
person.
 
To
 
avoid
 
signiﬁcant
 
delays
 
in
 
data
 
collection,
 
we
 
will
 
conduct
 
telephonic
 
surveys

we
 
will

In
 
cities
 
with
 
smaller

we
 
will
 
primarily
 
rely
 
on
 
telephonic

Approximately
 
40%

The
 
tool
 
development,
 
testing,
 
training,
 
piloting
 
and
 
data
 
collection
 
process
 
as
 
has
 
been
 
summarised
 
below,
 
and
 
detailed
 
in
 
the
 
proposal
 
and
 
annexures.
 
3.3
 
Data
 
collection
 
We
 
are
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
tight
 
16-week
 
timeline
 
for
 
the
 
assignment.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
sample
 
is
 
distributed
 
across
 
10
 
cities,
 
including
 
some
 
with
 
smaller
 
sample
 
sizes,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
chance
 
that,
 
despite
 
multiple
 
attempts,
 
we
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
reach
 
all
 
respondents.
 
To
 
address
 
this,
 
we
 
will
 
need
 
support
 
from
 
the
 
Tech
 
Mahindra
 
team
 
in
 
ensuring
 
an
 
adequate
 
number
 
of
 
respondents
 
are
 
available
 
on
 
the
 
designated
 
workdays.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
would
 
appreciate
 
assistance
 
in
 
mobilising
 
respondents
 
for
 
the
 
telephonic
 
interviews.
 
3.3.1
 
Methodology:
 
Most
 
Signiﬁcant
 
Stories
 
of
 
Change
 
 
Most
 
Signiﬁcant
 
Stories
 
of
 
Change
 
is
 
suggested
 
as
 
a
 
participatory
 
method
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
track
 
the
 
geography
 
and
 
vulnerability-speciﬁc
 
intended
 
and
 
unintended
 
narratives
 
of
 
change
 
in
 
outcomes
 
shared
 
by
 
participants
 
and
 
pinpoint
 
the
 
ones
 
that
 
are
 
most
 
effective.
 
The
 
merit
 
of
 
utilizing
 
this
 
technique
 
lies
 
in
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
it
 
involves
 
and
 
engages
 
with
 
the
 
participants
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
program
 
staff
 
(ﬁeld
 
staff,
 
programme
 
teams)
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
funding
 
agency
 
giving
 
voice
 
to
 
perspectives
 
of
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
throughout
 
the
 
chain.
 
Suitability
 
of
 
this
 
method
 
for
 
this
 
study
 
is
 
detailed
 
in
 
the
 
proposal
.
 
3.3.2
 
Qualitative
 
Data
 
Collection
 
 
 
 
 
The
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data
 
will
 
inform
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
qualitative
 
tools
 
and
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
purposefully
 
select
 
participants.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
us
 
delve
 
deeper
 
into
 
the
 
pathways
 
of
 
change.
 
As
 
mentioned
 
earlier,
 
this
 
approach
 
will
 
also
 
help
 
us
 
identify
 
relevant
 
case
 
stories,
 
both
 
where
 
signiﬁcant
 
impact
 
was
 
observed
 
and
 
where
 
it
 
was
 
not.
 
It
 
will
 
guide
 
us
 
in
 
selecting
 
participants
 
for
 
in-depth
 
interviews.
 
While
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
identify
 
these
 
particular
 
cases,
 
we
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
changes
 
have
 
occurred
 
(or
 
not)
 
under
 
different
 
pre-conditions
 
that
 
can
 
signiﬁcantly
 
inﬂuence
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
change
 
in
 
employability
 
and
 
empowerment.
 
Sample
 
checklists
 
of
 
these
 
parameters,
 
both
 
external
 
(environmental)
 
and
 
internal
 
(personal
 
and
 
relational),
 
that
 
we
 
would
 
consider
 
for
 
qualitative
 
sample
 
selection
 
can
 
be
 
referred
 
through
 
the
 
proposal
.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
triangulating
 
and
 
verifying
 
our
 
ﬁndings,
 
having
 
multiple
 
perspectives
 
will
 
also
 
bring
 
out
 
more
 
nuances
 
into
 
the
 
stories
 
of
 
change
 
of
 
these
 
participants.

It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
timely
 
data
 
collection
 
particularly
 
for
 
face-to-face
 
and
 
telephonic
 
data
 
collection,
 
is
 
contingent
 
on
 
Tech
 
Mahindra
 
ensuring
 
an
 
adequate
 
number
 
of
 
respondents
 
are
 
available
 
on
 
the
 
assigned
 
workdays
 
and
 
that
 
they
 
actively
 
engage
 
with
 
the
 
research
 
team.
 
For
 
telephonic
 
interviews,
 
it
 
is
 
critical
 
that
 
respondents
 
answer
 
the
 
calls
 
and
 
participate
 
willingly,
 
as
 
this
 
directly
 
impacts
 
the
 
reliability
 
and
 
representativeness
 
of
 
the
 
data.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
will
 
require
 
active
 
support
 
from
 
Tech
 
Mahindra
 
in
 
mobilising
 
respondents
 
for
 
telephonic
 
interviews.
 
This
 
includes
 
ensuring
 
respondents
 
are
 
informed
 
about
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
study,
 
the
 
timing
 
of
 
calls,
 
and
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
their
 
participation,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
addressing
 
any
 
hesitations
 
or
 
logistical
 
barriers
 
they
 
may
 
face.
 
This
 
collaborative
 
effort
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
ensure
 
smooth
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
process.
 
3.4
 
QC
 
and
 
Assurance
 
Quality
 
control
 
and

measures
 
form
 
an
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
studies
 
conducted
 
by
 
CMS.
 
This
 
encompasses
 
tool
 
testing,
 
enumerator
 
selection,
 
training
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
members
 
on
 
the
 
tools,
 
data
 
monitoring
 
and
 
its
 
management
 
and
 
cleaning.
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
indispensable
 
steps
 
that
 
ensure
 
quality
 
evaluation.
 
The
 
detailed
 
process
 
of
 
quality
 
control
 
and
 
assurance
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
proposal
.

The
 
cities
 
for
 
qualitative

our
 
research
 
questions
 
through

analysis
 
of
 
quantitative
 
and

3.5.1
 
Quantitative
 
analysis
 
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
collected
 
at
 
the
 
participant
 
level
 
will
 
be
 
analyzed
 
using
 
advanced
 
statistical
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
STATA.
 
We
 
will
 
analyze
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as
 
mean,
 
median,
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
quartile
 
or
 
decile
 
distribution,
 
along
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
of
 
outcome
 
and
 
impact
 
indicators,
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
impact.
  
 
3.5.2
 
Qualitative
 
Analysis
 
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
analyze
 
the
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collected
 
through
 
the
 
FGDs,
 
IDIs
 
and
 
KIIs
 
using
 
qualitative
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Nvivo
 
or
 
Atlas.ti,
 
using
 
analytical
 
techniques
 
like
 
narrative
 
analysis
 
and
 
thematic
 
analysis.
  
 
For
 
further
 
details
 
on
 
the
 
analysis
 
and
 
steps
 
involved,
 
please

the
 
proposal
.
 
3.5.3
 
Reporting
 
 
The
 
ﬁnal
 
report
 
will
 
present
 
the
 
overall
 
ﬁndings
 
of
 
the
 
study,
 
highlighting
 
the
 
changes
 
experienced
 
by
 
women
 
participants
 
in
 
improving
 
their
 
employability
 
and
 
how
 
this
 
contributed
 
to
 
their
 
empowerment.
 
While
 
empowerment
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
result
 
of
 
improved
 
employability
 
and
 
income
 
achieved
 
through
 
the
 
program,
 
the
 
relationship
 
is
 
not
 
strictly
 
linear.
 
There
 
are
 
certain
 
preconditions,
 
as
 
noted
 
in
 
our
 
measurement
 
and
 
sampling
 
framework,
 
that
 
can
 
either
 
enable
 
or
 
inhibit
 
women
 
from
 
making
 
the
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
opportunities
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
program
 
and
 
becoming
 
empowered.
 
This
 
process
 
often
 
takes
 
time,
 
requiring
 
changes
 
both
 
within
 
and
 
outside
 
the
 
woman,
 
which
 
progress
 
at
 
different
 
paces
 
and
 
with
 
different
 
sets
 
of
 
preconditions.
 
Therefore,
 
an
 
in-depth
 
analysis
 
and
 
synthesis
 
of
 
ﬁndings
 
from
 
both
 
methods
 
will
 
truly
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
uncover
 
signiﬁcant
 
stories
 
of
 
change
 
and
 
understand
 
the
 
program’s
 
contribution
 
to
 
the
 
overall
 
process.
 
Through
 
our
 
approach,
 
we
 
can
 
effectively
 
bring
 
these
 
stories
 
to
 
the
 
forefront.
 
We
 
will
 
highlight
 
success
 
stories,
 
enablers,
 
barriers,
 
challenges,
 
and
 
opportunities
 
for
 
improvement.
 
By
 
combining
 
quantitative
 
metrics
 
of
 
change
 
across
 
years
 
and
 
contexts
 
with
 
our
 
narratives,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
showcase
 
the
 
program's
 
impact,
 
pathways
 
to
 
change,
 
and
 
sustainability
 
of
 
the
 
impact.
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
will
 
provide
 
recommendations
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
adopted
 
by
 
the
 
program
 
to
 
strengthen
 
its
 
approach
 
towards
 
women’s
 
empowerment.

5.3:
 
Overall
 
Findings
 
from
 
recce
 
visit
 
Aligned
 
with
 
the
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
(ToC)
 
Activities
 
1.
 
Engagement
 
and
 
Mobilisation
 
–
 
The
 
centres
 
showed
 
strong
 
mobilisation
 
efforts
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
marginalized
 
communities.
 
These
 
efforts
 
included
 
door-to-door
 
campaigns,
 
partnerships
 
with
 
NGOs
 
and
 
community
 
leaders,
 
and
 
leveraging
 
alumni
 
networks
 
to
 
encourage
 
participation.
 
Social
 
media
 
campaigns
 
were
 
also
 
utilized,
 
particularly
 
for
 
reaching
 
urban
 
and
 
peri-urban
 
populations.
 
At
 
the
 
Safa
 
Tech
 
Mahindra
 
Centre
 
in
 
Hyderabad,
 
family
 
engagement
 
was
 
prioritized
 
to
 
support
 
women’s
 
participation,
 
addressing
 
cultural
 
barriers.
 
While
 
these
 
efforts
 
were
 
impactful,
 
challenges
 
such
 
as
 
low
 
awareness
 
about
 
speciﬁc
 
programs
 
in
 
some
 
regions
 
were
 
observed.
 
2.
 
Counselling
 
and
 
Vision
 
Building
 
–
 
Career
 
counselling
 
sessions
 
played
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
role
 
in
 
motivating
 
participants
 
to
 
pursue
 
skill-based
 
training.
 
Counsellors
 
worked
 
closely
 
with
 
prospective
 
trainees
 
and
 
their
 
families
 
to
 
highlight
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
these
 
programs,
 
especially
 
for
 
women.
 
These
 
sessions
 
aligned
 
individual
 
aspirations
 
with
 
market
 
demands,
 
boosting
 
conﬁdence
 
and
 
overcoming
 
barriers
 
such
 
as
 
misinformation
 
or
 
limited
 
awareness
 
about
 
career
 
opportunities.
 
In
 
locations
 
like
 
the
 
Healthcare
 
Academy
 
in
 
Bandra,
 
counsellors
 
actively
 
addressed
 
family
 
concerns,
 
ensuring
 
greater
 
enrolment
 
and
 
retention.
 
3.
 
Training
 
and
 
Skilling
 
–
 
The
 
training
 
programs
 
combined
 
foundational
 
skills
 
like
 
English
 
and
 
IT
 
with
 
domain-speciﬁc
 
technical
 
knowledge
 
and
 
soft
 
skills
 
development.
 
Practical
 
and
 
theoretical
 
components
 
were
 
balanced
 
to
 
prepare
 
participants
 
for
 
the
 
workforce.

Programs
 
in
 
healthcare
 
and
 
digital
 
technology
 
offered
 
hands-on
 
learning
 
through
 
internships,
 
live
 
projects,
 
and
 
role-playing
 
exercises.
 
Trainers
 
emphasized
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
practical
 
exposure
 
in
 
building
 
conﬁdence
 
and
 
technical
 
proﬁciency.
 
While
 
most
 
centres
 
had
 
well-equipped
 
training
 
facilities,
 
some
 
gaps
 
were
 
identiﬁed,
 
such
 
as
 
limited
 
access
 
to
 
advanced
 
tools
 
in
 
speciﬁc
 
courses.
 
Outputs
 
Observations
 
during
 
the
 
visits
 
highlighted
 
several
 
key
 
outputs
 
that
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
program’s
 
objectives,
 
such
 
as-
 
 
1.
 
Number
 
of
 
Centres
 
and
 
Programs–
 
The
 
network
 
included
 
75
 
SMART
 
Centres
 
offering
 
training
 
across
 
15
 
domains,
 
with
 
12
 
specialized
 
academies
 
focusing
 
on
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
healthcare,
 
logistics,
 
and
 
IT/digital
 
technologies.
 
This
 
extensive
 
reach
 
enabled
 
the
 
program
 
to
 
cater
 
to
 
a
 
diverse
 
group
 
of
 
youth
 
across
 
various
 
regions.
 
2.
 
Scholarships
 
and
 
Accessibility
 
–
 
Scholarships
 
and
 
subsidized
 
fees
 
were
 
instrumental
 
in
 
making
 
the
 
programs
 
accessible
 
to
 
students
 
from
 
economically
 
weaker
 
backgrounds.
 
Women
 
and
 
differently-abled
 
individuals
 
particularly
 
beneﬁted
 
from
 
ﬁnancial
 
aid,
 
which
 
helped
 
reduce
 
dropout
 
rates
 
and
 
improve
 
participation.
 
3.
 
Certiﬁcations
 
and
 
Employability
 
–
 
Certiﬁcations
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
academies
 
were
 
aligned
 
with
 
industry
 
requirements,
 
enhancing
 
participants'
 
employability.
 
These
 
certiﬁcations
 
were
 
highly
 
valued
 
by
 
alumni,
 
as
 
they
 
increased
 
credibility
 
during
 
job
 
applications
 
and
 
interviews.
 
4.
 
Placement
 
and
 
Employment
 
–
 
Placement
 
support
 
was
 
an
 
integral
 
component
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Centres
 
maintained
 
strong
 
industry
 
partnerships,
 
which
 
facilitated
 
employment
 
opportunities
 
for
 
participants.
 
Placement
 
rates
 
ranged
 
from
 
75%
 
to
 
100%
 
for
 
several
 
courses,
 
with
 
graduates
 
securing
 
jobs
 
in
 
organisations
 
such
 
as
 
Titan,
 
Delhivery,
 
Leela,
 
Reliance
 
and
 
Radisson.
 
Alumni
 
reported
 
starting
 
salaries
 
between
 
Rs10,000
 
and
 
Rs18,000,
 
reﬂecting
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
placement
 
process.
 
Outcomes
 
While
 
the
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
visits
 
was
 
primarily
 
on
 
understanding
 
operational
 
processes,
 
some
 
initial
 
observations
 
of
 
outcomes
 
were
 
noted
 
during
 
the
 
visits.
 
Findings
 
from
 
the
 
visits
 
conﬁrmed
 
several
 
outputs,
 
including
 
the
 
wide
 
availability
 
of
 
centres
 
and
 
programs,
 
ﬁnancial
 
support
 
mechanisms,
 
and
 
industry-recognized
 
certiﬁcations.
 
These
 
outputs
 
provided
 
a
 
solid
 
foundation
 
for
 
achieving
 
the
 
program’s
 
desired
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impacts.
 
However,
 
gaps
 
were
 
noted
 
in
 
areas
 
like
 
dropout
 
tracking,
 
alumni
 
progression,
 
and
 
the
 
identiﬁcation
 
of
 
barriers
 
faced
 
by
 
trainees.
 
Addressing
 
these
 
gaps
 
in
 
future
 
evaluations
 
would
 
enhance
 
the
 
program’s
 
ability
 
to
 
assess
 
its
 
achievements
 
comprehensively
 
and
 
address
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement.
 
1.
 
Short-Term
 
Outcomes
 
–
 
Participants
 
demonstrated
 
improved
 
technical
 
and
 
communication
 
skills.
 
The
 
practical
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
training,
 
such
 
as
 
internships
 
and
 
live
 
projects,
 
enhanced
 
job-speciﬁc
 
expertise
 
and
 
prepared
 
trainees
 
for
 
workplace
 
challenges.
 
These
 
short-term
 
improvements
 
were
 
reported
 
across
 
various
 
centres.
 
2.
 
Long-Term
 
Potential
 
–
 
Although
 
systematic
 
long-term
 
data
 
and
 
changes
 
over
 
the
 
period
 
was
 
not
 
captured
 
during
 
the
 
visits,
 
feedback
 
from
 
alumni
 
suggested

toward
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence
 
and
 
stability.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
Alumni
 
interviewed
 
shared
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
contributing
 
to
 
household
 
incomes
 
or
 
managing
 
their
 
ﬁnances
 
independently.
 
Women
 
trainees
 
showed
 
increased
 
conﬁdence
 
and
 
decision-making
 
capabilities,
 
which
 
were
 
reﬂected
 
in
 
their
 
professional
 
and
 
personal
 
growth.
 
Impact
 
While
 
the
 
reconnaissance
 
visits
 
were
 
not
 
designed
 
to
 
formally
 
measure
 
or
 
validate
 
program
 
impacts,
 
some
 
potential
 
outcomes
 
and
 
transformative
 
changes
 
were
 
evident:
 
1.
 
Employability
 
and
 
Income:
 
The
 
programs
 
have
 
signiﬁcantly
 
enhanced
 
participants'
 
employability
 
and
 
income-generating
 
capabilities.
 
Alumni
 
shared
 
stories
 
of
 
transitioning
 
from
 
unemployment
 
to
 
stable
 
jobs,
 
leading
 
to
 
improved
 
ﬁnancial
 
security
 
and
 
better
 
living
 
conditions
 
for
 
their
 
families.
 
These
 
experiences
 
underscore
 
the
 
program's
 
role
 
in
 
addressing
 
economic
 
challenges
 
and
 
fostering
 
long-term
 
stability.
 
2.
 
Agency
 
and
 
Empowerment:
 
Women
 
participants
 
demonstrated
 
increased
 
conﬁdence
 
and
 
an
 
active
 
role
 
in
 
household
 
decision-making.
 
At
 
the
 
Safa
 
Centre,
 
graduates
 
of
 
the
 
Women
 
Entrepreneur
 
Development
 
Program
 
successfully
 
started
 
small
 
businesses,
 
breaking
 
cultural
 
barriers
 
and
 
creating
 
economic
 
opportunities
 
for
 
themselves
 
and
 
others
 
within
 
their
 
communities.
 
3.
 
Indications
 
of
 
Broader
 
Impact:
 
Many
 
current
 
female
 
students
 
reported
 
being
 
inspired
 
by
 
alumni
 
success
 
stories
 
(either
 
from
 
family
 
members
 
or
 
neighbours
 
or
 
friends/relatives),
 
which
 
encouraged
 
them
 
to
 
enrol
 
in
 
the
 
programs
 
with
 
aspirations
 
for
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence
 
and
 
self-reliance.
 
This
 
highlights
 
the
 
ripple
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
programs,
 
showcasing
 
their
 
potential
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
not
 
only
 
individual
 
trajectories
 
but
 
also
 
broader
 
community
 
mindsets,
 
contributing
 
to
 
lasting
 
social
 
and
 
economic
 
empowerment.
 
These
 
ﬁndings
 
demonstrate
 
how
 
the
 
program’s
 
activities
 
and
 
outputs
 
are
 
contributing
 
to
 
positive
 
changes
 
in
 
participants’
 
lives.
 
Strengthening
 
operational
 
processes
 
and
 
addressing
 
identiﬁed
 
gaps
 
will
 
further
 
enhance
 
the
 
program’s
 
impact
 
on
 
employability,
 
ﬁnancial
 
stability,
 
and
 
empowerment
 
for
 
marginalized
 
communities.
 
The
 
main
 
survey
 
will
 
assess
 
indicators
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
to
 
evaluate
 
program
 
effectiveness.
 
It
 
will
 
explore
 
participant
 
engagement,
 
inclusivity
 
of
 
onboarding,
 
and
 
training
 
relevance,
 
along
 
with
 
outputs
 
like
 
accessibility,
 
certiﬁcations,
 
and
 
placement
 
success.
 
Outcomes
 
such
 
as
 
employment
 
sustainability,
 
income
 
growth,
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence
 
will
 
be
 
tracked,
 
alongside
 
broader
 
impacts
 
like
 
shifts
 
in
 
decision-making
 
roles,
 
community
 
perceptions,
 
and
 
entrepreneurial
 
success,
 
capturing
 
the
 
program’s
 
transformative
 
potential.

Jennifer,
 
the
 
current
 
WPR
 
trainer
 
and
 
counselor,
 
is
 
an
 
alumnus
 
of
 
the
 
Tally
 
course.
 
During
 
her
 
time
 
at
 
FIDES,
 
she
 
developed
 
an
 
interest
 
in
 
social
 
work
 
and
 
was
 
inspired
 
to
 
help
 
others.
 
This
 
is
 
her
 
ﬁrst
 
job,
 
and
 
she
 
faced
 
signiﬁcant
 
ﬁnancial
 
challenges
 
in
 
completing
 
her
 
education,
 
as
 
her
 
parents
 
did
 
not
 
contribute
 
to
 
her
 
studies.
 
However,
 
her
 
aunt,
 
who
 
works
 
at
 
FIDES,
 
supported
 
her
 
and
 
introduced
 
her
 
to
 
the
 
course.
 
Jennifer
 
now
 
shares
 
her
 
story
 
to
 
inspire
 
others
 
facing
 
similar
 
challenges.
 
She
 
plans
 
to
 
earn
 
an
 
income
 
while
 
preparing
 
to
 
pursue
 
an
 
MBA
 
in
 
HR
 
from
 
IGNOU
 
to
 
advance
 
her
 
career.
