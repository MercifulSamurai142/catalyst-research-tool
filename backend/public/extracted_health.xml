22
 
Indian
 
states
 
and

.
 

 
Context
 
and
 
Background
 
of
 
the
 
Study
 
South
 
Asia
 
is
 
home
 
to
 
two
 
ﬁfths
 
of
 
the
 
world’s
 
undernourished
 
population,
 
and
 
poorer
 
communities
 
in
 
this
 
region
 
experience
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
incidence
 
of
 
related
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
child
 
wasting
 
and
 
stunting.
 
Poor
 
diet
 
quality
 
contributes
 
towards
 
persistent
 
nutrient
 
deﬁciency,
 
and
 
food
 
safety
 
net
 
programs
 
in
 
this
 
region,
 
although
 
present
 
at
 
scale,
 
often
 
favour
 
grain
 
heavy
 
diets
 
over
 
nutrient
 
diversity.
 
India
 
particularly
 
falls
 
into
 
the
 
category
 
of
 
serious
 
hunger,
 
as
 
evidenced
 
by
 
data
 
hosted
 
by
 
the
 
Global
 
Hunger
 
Index,
 
with
 
14%
 
of
 
the
 
general
 
population
 
being
 
malnourished
 
and
 
36%
 
of
 
children
 
under
 
ﬁve
 
being
 
stunted.
 
Although
 
malnutrition
 
has
 
reduced
 
since
 
2000,
 
these
 
improvements
 
have
 
not
 
commensurately
 
translated
 
into
 
reduced
 
child
 
malnutrition
 
and
 
stunting.
 
In
 
Bangladesh,
 
12%
 
of
 
the
 
general
 
population
 
is
 
malnourished,
 
and
 
24%
 
of
 
children
 
under
 
ﬁve
 
are
 
stunted.
 
While
 
Nepal
 
occupies
 
a
 
relatively
 
lower
 
level
 
of
 
malnourishment
 
compared
 
to
 
India
 
and
 
Bangladesh
 
(with
 
6%
 
of
 
the
 
population
 
experiencing
 
malnourishment),
 
child
 
stunting
 
(25%
 
of
 
children
 
under
 
ﬁve
 
years
 
of
 
age)
1
 
remains
 
a
 
notable
 
concern
 
for
 
public
 
health.
 
Malnourishment,
 
especially
 
in
 
children,
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
considerable
 
health
 
complications,
 
imparting
 
a
 
greater
 
risk
 
of
 
illness
 
and
 
reduced
 
capacity
 
for
 
learning
 
and
 
study.
 
Repeated
 
incidences
 
of
 
illnesses
 
would
 
increase
 
expenditure
 
on
 
healthcare,
 
and
 
reduce
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
workdays
 
available
 
for
 
households.
 
Further,
 
child
 
malnourishment
 
compromises
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
transform
 
their
 
lives
 
through
 
education,
 
further
 
perpetuating
 
the
 
cycle
 
of
 
poverty
 
and
 
suffering.
 
Given
 
that
 
food
 
security
 
programs
 
targeting
 
availability
 
of
 
staple
 
grains
 
are
 
insufﬁcient
 
in
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
poor
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
sufﬁciently
 
diverse
 
and
 
wholesome
 
diet,

In
 
this
 
context,
 
[Client
 
Organization]’s
 
([CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION])
 
[Client
 
Program]
 
([CLIENT
 
PROGRAM])
 
initiative
 
is
 
a
 
notable
 
program
 
that
 
adopts
 
a
 
multifaceted
 
approach
 
towards
 
educating
 
and
 
empowering
 
malnourished
 
rural
 
communities
 
in
 
India,
 
Nepal
 
and
 
Bangladesh
 
to
 
secure
 
sufﬁcient
 
nutrient
 
availability.
 
The
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
works
 
at
 
both
 
the
 
household
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
community
 
level.
 
For
 
households,
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
conducts
 
15-day
 
nutrition
 
camps
 
that
 
educate
 
mothers
 
of
 
malnourished
 
children
 
on
 
nutrition
 
education,
 
child
 
feeding,
 
and
 
child
 
care
 
practices
 
among
 
other
 
topics.
 
Households
 
are
 
further
 
educated
 
on
 
optimal
 
and
 
sustainable
 
cultivation
 
and
 
usage
 
strategies
 
of
 
homestead
 
land
 
to
 
maximise
 
nutrient
 
production
 
by
 
area,
 
and
 
are
 
connected
 
to
 
government
 
entitlements
 
and
 
services
 
for
 
sanitation
 
and
 
health
 
to
 
better
 
improve
 
their
 
resilience.
 
At
 
the
 
community
 
level,
 
initiatives
 
include
 
disseminating
 
education
 
on
 
linking
 
agriculture
 
and
 
local
 
natural
 
resources
 
management
 
(LANN)
 
and
 
building
 
experiencing-sharing
 
communities
 
within
 
geographies.
 
From
 
September
 
2018,
 
this
 
program
 
has
 
been
 
in
 
operation
 
in
 
260
 
selected
 
villages
 
across
 
India,
 
Nepal
 
and
 
Bangladesh.
 
Such
 
a
 
program
 
has
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
impart
 
sustainable
 
nutritional
 
resilience
 
among
 
poorer
 
communities
 
in
 
South
 
Asia.
 
However,
 
given
 
the
 
multidimensional
 
approach
 
towards
 
eradicating
 
malnutrition,
 
which
 
can
 
prove
 
complex
 
in
 
certain
 
circumstances,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
unique
 
cultures
 
and
 
geographies
 
of
 
this
 
region,
 
it
 
is
 
imperative
 
to
 
rigorously
 
evaluate
 
the
 
program
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
it
 
continues
 
to
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
outcomes
 
highlighted
 
in
 
the
 
theory
 
of
 
change.
 
 
This
 
evaluation
 
will
 
ﬁrst
 
assess
 
existing
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
data
 
to
 
determine
 
if
 
it
 
adequately
 
measures
 
success,
 
outcomes,
 
sustainability,
 
and
 
stakeholder
 
needs.
 
Based
 
on
 
this,
 
the
 
second
 
phase
 
will
 
reﬁne
 
or
 
redesign
 
the
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
to
 
deliver
 
robust,
 
actionable
 
insights
 
on
 
program
 
performance
 
and
 
effectiveness.
 
Technical
 
Approach
 
and
 
Methodology
 
Data
 
Quality
 
Assessment
 
As
 
a
 
ﬁrst
 
step
 
towards
 
evaluating
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program,
 
the
 
team
 
at
 
CMS
 
will
 
delve
 
rigorously
 
into
 
the
 
quality
 
and
 
extent
 
of
 
existing
 
data
 
available
 
and
 
provided
 
by
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION].
 
We
 
will
 
adopt
 
the
 
data
 
quality
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
used
 
by
 
USAID,
 
developed
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
the
 
Automated
 
Directives
 
System
 
(ADS)
 
203.
 
This
 
framework
 
provides
 
ﬁve
 
overarching
 
dimensions
 
along
 
which
 
data
 
quality
 
will
 
be
 
evaluated:
 
Validity,
 
Integrity,
 
Precision,
 
Reliability,
 
and
 
Timeliness
 
(V-I-P-R-T).
 
A
 
schematic
 
outlining
 
an
 
indicative
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]’s
 
program
 
data
 
through
 
the
 
lens
 
of
 
this
 
framework
 
is
 
highlighted
 
below.
 

 
The
 
data
 
quality
 
assessment
 
will
 
utilize
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
primary
 
data,
 
project
 
reports,
 
handbooks,
 
documentation,
 
country-speciﬁc
 
government
 
initiatives,
 
and
 
reliable
 
national
 
and
 
international
 
statistics
 
to
 
validate
 
ﬁndings.
 
This
 
exercise
 
aims
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
following:
 
1.
 
How
 
well
 
does
 
the
 
Phase
 
1
 
and
 
Phase
 
2
 
data
 
align
 
with
 
assessing
 
the
 
program’s
 
success
 
in
 
achieving
 
improved
 
dietary
 
intake
 
and
 
better
 
child
 
and
 
maternal
 
health
 
outcomes?
 
2.
 
Does
 
the
 
data
 
provide
 
sufﬁcient
 
information
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
these
 
outcomes
 
compared
 
to
 
initial
 
conditions?
 
3.
 
Can
 
the
 
project’s
 
future
 
impact
 
trajectory
 
be
 
assessed
 
alongside
 
a
 
structured
 
endline
 
evaluation,
 
or
 
is
 
additional
 
data
 
required?
 
4.
 
Is
 
the
 
data
 
granular
 
enough
 
to
 
allow
 
disaggregation
 
by
 
socio-economic,
 
geographic,
 
cultural,
 
and
 
demographic
 
factors?
 
5.
 
To
 
what
 
extent
 
does
 
the
 
Phase
 
1
 
and
 
Phase
 
2
 
data
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
stakeholders
 
using
 
the
 
evaluation?
 
6.
 
Are
 
there
 
gaps
 
in
 
the
 
existing
 
indicators
 
for
 
assessing
 
program
 
success,
 
effectiveness,
 
and
 
sustainability?
 
If
 
so,
 
what
 
are
 
they?
 
7.
 
Is
 
the
 
data
 
sufﬁcient
 
for
 
use
 
in
 
a
 
rigorous
 
endline
 
evaluation
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
program’s
 
long-term
 
success?
 
CMS
 
and
 
its
 
country
 
data
 
collection
 
partners
 
will
 
undertake
 
an
 
immersion
 
visit
 
to
 
the
 
study
 
area.
 
The
 
ﬁndings
 
from
 
this
 
phase
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
will
 
help
 
inform
 
the
 
approach
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
adopted
 
in
 
the
 
endline
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program.
 


Evaluation
 
Framework
 
The
 
endline
 
evaluation
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
REEISC-I
 
framework,
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
OECD-DAC
 
revised
 
criteria
 
(2019).
 
This
 
framework
 
evaluates
 
the
 
intervention
 
across
 
six
 
dimensions:
 
Relevance,
 
Effectiveness
 
&amp;
 
Efﬁciency,
 
Inclusivity,
 
Impact,
 
Sustainability,
 
and
 
Coherence.
 
An
 
indicative
 
outline
 
showing
 
the
 
alignment
 
of
 
these
 
dimensions
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
assessment
 
is
 
depicted
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁgure
 
on
 
the
 
left.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
will
 
incorporate
 
both
 
assessments
 
of
 
households
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
their
 
dietary
 
and
 
nutrition
 
proﬁles,
 
health
 
status
 
(physical
 
and
 
mental),
 
sanitation
 
and
 
hygiene
 
facilities
 
and
 
practices,
 
adoption
 
of
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
on
 
homestead
 
plots,
 
and
 
linkages
 
to
 
government
 
schemes
 
and
 
entitlements
 
both
 
through
 
and
 
outside
 
the
 
program;
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
community
 
cadre
 
and
 
organizations
 
established
 
under
 
the
 
aegis
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
LANN+
 
dissemination
 
through
 
the
 
community
 
and
 
other
 
practices
 
adopted.
 
Evaluation
 
Methodology/approach
 
The
 
approach
 
taken
 
to
 
data
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
and
 
recommendations
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
quality
 
assessment,
 
to
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
evaluation.

possible
 
approaches
 
are

With
 
the
 
assumption
 
that
 
phase
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
data
 
is
 
suitable
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
rigorous
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
at
 
the
 
[Client
 
Program]
 
([CLIENT
 
PROGRAM])
 
level
 
vis-a-vis
 
its
 
envisioned
 
outcomes,
 
a
 
pre-post
 
strategy
 
will
 
be
 
employed,
 
where
 
statistics
 
of
 
households
 
that
 
were
 
collected
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
evaluation
 
before
 
the
 
induction
 
of
 
phase
 
1
 
will
 
be
 
compared
 
to
 
indicators
 
sampled
 
at
 
endline.
 
By
 
focusing
 
primarily
 
on
 
dimensions
 
that
 
were
 
tackled
 
by
 
the
 
program
 
and
 
not
 
by
 
local
 
governments
 
or
 
civil
 
society,
 
this
 
would
 
provide
 
an
 
indicative
 
insight
 
into
 
the
 
change
 
effected
 
by
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
among
 
participant
 
households.
 
 
Case
 
control
 
methodologies
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
considered
 
wherein
 
the
 
differences
 
in
 
implementation
 
rollout,
 
timing,
 
and
 
strategies,
 
if
 
any,
 
could
 
be
 
exploited
 
to
 
compare
 
impacts
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
ascertain
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
implementation
 
intensity
 
or
 
exposure
 
on
 
outcomes.
 
These
 
could
 
include
 
the
 


availability
 
of
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
education
 
or
 
community
 
level
 
institutional
 
establishment.
 
 
Approach
 
2:
 
Use
 
of
 
Propensity
 
Score
 
Matching
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
a
 
pre-post
 
and
 
case
 
control
 
analysis
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries,
 
information
 
could
 
also
 
be
 
collected
 
from
 
demographically
 
matched
 
control
 
households
 
in
 
villages
 
located
 
in
 
proximity
 
to
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]s,
 
and
 
allow
 
for
 
matching
 
and
 
comparison
 
to
 
estimate
 
the
 
improvements
 
that
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROGRAM]
 
approach
 
effected
 
among
 
beneﬁciaries.
 
This
 
would
 
require
 
collection
 
of
 
data
 
on
 
both
 
the
 
treatment
 
sample,
 
and
 
a
 
separate
 
matched
 
control
 
group
 
(sized
 
at
 
25%
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
sample).
 
This
 
approach
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
necessary
 
in
 
case
 
the
 
existing
 
data
 
on
 
phase
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
is
 
not
 
completely
 
adequate
 
for
 
assessing
 
all
 
intervention
 
outcomes,
 
thereby
 
eschewing
 
the
 
pre-post
 
analysis.
 
 
Approach
 
3
:
 
Building
 
a
 
New
 
RCT
 
If
 
data
 
from
 
Phase
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
is
 
deemed
 
to
 
be
 
unsuitable,
 
a
 
new
 
RCT
 
could
 
be
 
conducted
 
to
 
evaluate
 
Phase
 
3
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
This
 
would
 
use
 
the
 
available
 
data
 
to
 
suggest
 
improvements
 
possible
 
for
 
Phase
 
3.
 
The
 
existing
 
status
 
of
 
the
 
population
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
the
 
baseline,
 
and
 
the
 
evaluation
 
would
 
ascertain
 
the
 
additional
 
beneﬁts
 
brought
 
to
 
households,
 
women
 
and
 
children
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
improvements
 
made
 
to
 
Phase
 
3.
 
Under
 
this
 
approach,
 
the
 
control
 
and
 
treatment
 
will
 
follow
 
random
 
assignment.
 
This
 
approach
 
would
 
require
 
both
 
a
 
baseline
 
and
 
an
 
endline
 
evaluation,
 
with
 
both
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
groups.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
requirements
 
for
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
three
 
proposed
 
approaches
 
are
 
summarized

Tool
 
Design
 
The
 
survey
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
by
 
trained
 
ﬁeld
 
enumerators
 
utilising
 
Computer
 
Assisted
 
Personal
 
Interviewing
 
(CAPI)
 
tools.
 
Questionnaires
 
will
 
capture
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
geographic
 
particulars
 
of
 
the
 
beneﬁciary
 
residence,
 
their
 
demographic
 
characteristics
 
(age,
 
marital
 
status
 
etc.),
 
socioeconomic
 
information
 
(annual
 
income,
 
type
 
of
 
work,
 
number
 
of
 
children,
 
household
 
income,
 
working
 
members
 
in
 
the
 
household),
 
information
 
on
 
household
 
dietary
 
diversity,
 
access
 
to
 
government
 
pensions
 
and
 
entitlements,
 
and
 
WASH
 
practices.
 
A
 
tentative
 
list
 
of
 
indicators
 
and
 
the
 
stakeholder-wise
 
probable
 
sources
 
of
 
information
 
for
 
them
 
are
 
described
 
in
 
table
 
A1
 
of
 
the
 
appendix.
 
 
If
 
required,
 
for
 
20%
 
of
 
the
 
households,
 
detailed
 
anthropometric
 
information
 
can
 
be
 
collected
 
on
 
all
 
children
 
aged
 
under
 
5
 
years
 
-
 
including
 
height,
 
weight,
 
girth,
 
and
 
other
 
appropriate
 
indicators.
 
However,
 
this
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
currently
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
budget.
 
The
 
proposed
 
sample
 
sizes
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation,
 
detailed
 
in
  
T
able
 
A2
 
of
 
the
 
appendix,
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
chosen
 
approach.
 
Cochran’s
 
(1963)
 
formula
 
for
 
proportions,
 
adjusted
 
for
 
ﬁnite
 
populations,
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
determine
 
sample
 
sizes,
 
accounting
 
for
 
a
 
10%
 
attrition
 
rate.
 
For
 
Approach
 
1,
 
a
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
1,269
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
estimate
 
country-level
 
statistics
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
with
 
a
 
95%
 
conﬁdence
 
interval
 
and
 
a
 
margin
 
of
 
error
 
of
 
±5%.
 
Approach
 
2
 
(PSM)
 
requires
 
an
 
additional
 
control
 
group
 
of
 
317,
 
bringing
 
the
 
total
 
to
 
1,586.
 
Approach
 
3
 
(RCT)
 
involves
 
1,586
 
samples
 
across
 
two
 
points
 
(baseline
 
and
 
endline),
 
totaling
 
3,172
 
surveys.
 
The
 
sampling
 
design
 
will
 
use
 
a
 
two-stage
 
approach,
 
with
 
villages
 
as
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
stage
 
units
 
and
 
participant
 
households
 
as
 
the
 
second.
 
Villages
 
will
 
be
 
selected
 
based
 
on
 
program
 
data,
 
ensuring
 
geographical
 
diversity,
 
program
 
success,
 
operations,
 
and
 
socioeconomic
 
and
 
demographic
 
factors.
 
From
 
each
 
village,
 
10-15
 
households
 
will
 
be
 
surveyed,
 
capturing
 
the
 
population's
 
multidimensional
 
diversity.
 
Final
 
numbers
 
will
 
be
 
determined
 
after
 
reviewing
 
program
 
data
 
and
 
consulting
 
with
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION].
 
 
The
 
quantitative
 
survey
 
will
 
assess
 
household
 
level
 
metrics
 
to
 
evaluate
 
program
 
success
 
at
 
the
 
micro
 
level.
 
However,
 
community
 
level
 
inﬂuences
 
and
 
evidence
 
linking
 
pathways
 
to
 
success
 
to
 
program
 
outcomes
 
will
 
be
 
elucidated
 
through
 
qualitative
 
methodologies.
 
Qualitative
 
Methodology
 
&amp;
 
Sample
 
The
 
qualitative
 
survey
 
will
 
include
 
focus
 
group
 
discussions,
 
in-depth
 
interviews,
 
and
 
key
 
informant
 
interviews.
 
Three
 
focus
 
group
 
discussions
 
will
 
be
 
held
 
in
 
India,
 
Nepal,
 
and
 
Bangladesh,
 
involving
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
such
 
as
 
participating
 
households,
 
community
 
cadre
 
(e.g.,
 
village
 
self-help
 
group
 
leaders),
 
local
 
governing
 
body
 
ofﬁcials,
 
government
 
department
 
representatives,
 
and
 
implementing
 
agency
 
representatives.
 

Thirty
 
(30)
 
households
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
selected
 
among
 
the
 
best
 
and
 
worst
 
performers
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
nutrition
 
and
 
WASH
 
practices
 
for
 
in
 
depth
 
interviews,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
highlight
 
case
 
studies
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
To
 
better
 
introduce
 
quantitative
 
rigour
 
and
 
qualitative
 
analysis,
 
Qualitative
 
Comparative
 
Analysis
 
will
 
be
 
incorporated
 
to
 
delve
 
into
 
the
 
in

interviews/case
 
studies.
 
This
 
method
 
will
 
attempt
 
to
 
link
 
both
 
the
 
existing
 
theories
 
of
 
change
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
alternative
 
pathways
 
derived
 
from
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
to
 
case
 
outcomes
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
combinations
 
of
 
program
 
activities
 
and
 
behavioral
 
changes
 
that
 
lead
 
to
 
attainment
 
and
 
sustenance
 
(or
 
lack
 
thereof)
 
of
 
nutritional
 
outcomes
 
can
 
be
 
clearly

.
 
The

quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
split
 
between
 
a
 
student
 
survey
 
and
 
a
 
parent
 
survey
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
advanced
 
statistical
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
Stata.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
parents
 
assessment
 
will
 
be
 
facilitated
 
with
 
qualiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
through
 
a
 
CAPI
 
administered
 
tool.
 
All
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
carried
 
out
 
in
 
stages.
 
At
 
ﬁrst,
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as
 
mean,
 
median,
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
quartile
 
or
 
decile
 
distribution
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
along
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
cross-tabulations.
 
Then
 
as
 
a
 
second
 
step,
 
causality
 
would
 
be
 
established
 
using
 
econometric
 
methods
 
as
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
identiﬁcation
 
methodology
 
adopted
 
for
 
evaluations.
 
This
 
will
 
provide
 
impact
 
estimates
 
for
 
the
 
program.

Confidentiality
 
and
 
Ethical
 
Considerations
 
 
Ensuring
 
anonymity
 
and
 
protecting
 
respondent
 
identity
 
is
 
a
 
mandatory
 
requirement,
 
and
 
our
 
organisation
 
adheres
 
to
 
stringent
 
protocols
 
for
 
maintaining
 
the
 
highest
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdentiality.
 
We
 
have
 
implemented
 
robust
 
measures
 
to
 
safeguard
 
data
 
security
 
and
 
privacy
 
across
 
our
 
digital
 
tools
 
and

and
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
for
 
enumerators
 
on
 
data
 
sharing,
 
accompanied
 
by
 
conﬁdentiality
 
contracts.
 
Our
 
enumerators
 
undergo
 
comprehensive
 
training
 
to
 
remain
 
unbiased
 
and
 
refrain
 
from
 
sharing
 
any
 
personal
 
opinions,
 
claims,
 
or
 
identifying
 
information.
 
They
 
are
 
bound
 
by
 
a
 
conﬁdentiality
 
agreement
 
with
 
CMS,
 
committing
 
to
 
the
 
proper
 
use
 
of
 
conﬁdential
 
information
 
solely
 
for
 
the
 
designated
 
purposes
 
outlined
 
in
 
their
 
training,
 
and
 
not
 
disclosing
 
it
 
to
 
any
 
third
 
party.
 
Additionally,
 
our
 
enumerators
 
are
 
instructed
 
not
 
to
 
copy,
 
retain,
 
or
 
share
 
any
 
written
 
information
 
that
 
could
 
potentially
 
reveal
 
identifying

and
 
all
 
conﬁdential
 
information,
 
such
 
as
 
questionnaires,
 
notes,

ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
This
 
becomes
 
especially
 
relevant
 
in
 
the
 
post

scenario
 
wherein
 
the
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
following
 
stringent
 
guidelines
 
around
 
safety
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
following
 
international
 
standards.
 
 
After
 
the

is
 
ﬁnalised
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
JK

,
 
researchers
 
from
 
the

languages.
 
Monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Poor
 
quality
 
data
 
reduces
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
policy
 
intervention,
 
and
 
can
 
also
 
require
 
a
 
repeat
 
of
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring
 
enumerator
 
quality
 
controls
 
with
 
spot
 
checks,
 
back
 
checks
 
(on
 
major
 
topics,
 
time
 
taken,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
looping
 
mechanisms.
 
 
Data
 
management
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
yet
 
often
 
overlooked
 
aspect
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
JK
 
Cement
 
FOUNDATION
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
has
 
strong
 
experience
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
multiple
 
scripting
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Survey
 
CTO,
 
Commcare,
 
ODK,
 
etc.
 
and
 
experience
 
in
 
online
 
data
 
management.
 
Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
data
 
cleaning.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
validation
 
exercise
 
is
 
completed
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
post-cleaning
 
efforts
 
including
 
id
 
variable
 
checking,
 
outlier
 
tagging,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
replacements,
 
illogical
 
value
 
assessment,
 
addressing
 
typos,
 
survey
 
codes,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
adding
 
labels.
 
Irregularities
 
and
 
corrections
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
documented,
 
but
 
changes
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
after
 
introspection
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
insights.

economic,
 
and
 
environmental
 
factors
 
that
 
may
 
affect
 
the
 
achievement
 
of
 
impact
 
objectives.
 
Conduct
 
a
 
contextual
 
analysis
 
to
 
identify
 
contextual
 
variables
 
and
 
their
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
results.

Data
 
Analysis
 
and
 
Visualization:
 
Develop

charts
 
and
 
graphs,
 
to
 
effectively
 
communicate
 
the

Environment
:
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
environmental
 
initiatives
 
prioritize
 
improving
 
water
 
access
 
and
 
quality
 
for
 
nearby
 
communities.
 
In
 
the

focus
 
on
 
ensuring
 
sustainable
 
water
 
supply,

Potential
 
long-term
 
beneﬁts
 
include
 
sustained
 
access
 
to
 
clean
 
water,
 
particularly
 
during
 
droughts.
 
While
 
some
 
villages
 
 

 
receive
 
water
 
from
 
mines
 
or
 
government
 
borewells,
 
others
 
rely
 
on
 
private
 
tankers.
 
Introducing
 
pipelines
 
has
 
increased
 
satisfaction,
 
with
 
72%
 
expressing
 
contentment.
 
However,
 
challenges
 
like
 
intermittent
 
shortages
 
persist,
 
affecting
 
agriculture
 
and
 
domestic
 
supply
 
in
 
villages
 
like
 
Karunda,
 
Saand,
 
and
 
Paeri.
 
Despite
 
recent
 
improvements,
 
ongoing
 
efforts
 
are
 
needed
 
to
 
address
 
disparities
 
and
 
mitigate
 
water
 
scarcity
 
issues
 
exacerbated
 
by
 
mining
 
operations.

mitigating
 
illnesses,
 
and
 
building
 
community
 
resilience.
 
Long-term
 
goals
 
(5-7
 
years)
 
include
 
developing
 
a
 
disaster
 
relief
 
framework
 
for
 
enhanced
 
resilience.

livestock,
 
impacting
 
nearly
 
86%
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries,
 
showcasing
 
the
 
immediate
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
intervention.

initiatives
 
were
 
implemented,
 
acknowledged
 
by
 
69%
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries,
 
though
 
19%
 
remained
 
unaware,
 
indicating
 
communication
 
challenges.
 
Qualitative
 
insights
 
highlighted
 
the
 
positive
 
impact
 
of
 
sanitation
 
spraying
 
initiatives,
 
aligning
 
with
 
global
 
health
 
guidelines
 
and
 
addressing
 
community
 
needs
 
during
 
the
 
pandemic.
 
 
Education
:
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
education
 
interventions
 
aim
 
to
 
enhance
 
school
 
infrastructure,
 
resource
 
accessibility,
 
and
 
sports
 
participation
 
for
 
holistic
 
student
 
development.
 
This
 
includes
 
building
 
classrooms,
 
providing
 
educational
 
materials,
 
and
 
establishing
 
sports
 
facilities.
 
While
 
community
 
feedback
 
generally
 
reﬂects
 
satisfaction
 
with
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
school
 
infrastructure,
 
challenges
 
persist
 
in
 
resource
 
distribution,
 
affecting
 
44%
 
of
 
respondents.
 
The
 
provision
 
of
 
sports
 
kits
 
by
 
JK
 
Cement
 
receives
 
positive
 
feedback,
 
with
 
80%
 
acknowledging
 
their
 
quality,
 
building
 
physical
 
well-being
 
and
 
teamwork.
 
This

also
 
contributes
 
to
 
a
 
more

Introduction
 
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
CSR
 
initiatives
 
in
 
Nimbahera
 
district,
 
Rajasthan,
 
were
 
strategically
 
implemented
 
across
 
28
 
villages
 
situated
 
in
 
proximity
 
to
 
Nimbahera
 
City
 
and
 
its
 
Sub-Division,
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
addressing
 
critical
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
health,
 
education,
 
environment,
 
livelihood,
 
rural
 
transformation,
 
and
 
disaster
 
relief.
 
These
 
initiatives
 
extended
 
their
 
reach
 
to
 
encompass
 
Chittorgarh
 
District,
 
particularly
 
in
 
Nimbahera
 
Block,
 
Mangrol
 
GP,
 
and
 
Neemuch
 
(Chainpura
 
and
 
Bawanwadi),
 
effectively
 
covering
 
regions
 
surrounding
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
operational
 
areas.
 
Over
 
a
 
span
 
of
 
three
 
years,
 
the
 
projects
 
aimed
 
to
 
positively
 
inﬂuence
 
the
 
socio-economic
 
landscape
 
of
 
the
 
communities
 
they
 
served.
 
 
The
 
primary
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
conducted
 
impact
 
assessment
 
was
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
CSR
 
interventions
 
in
 
Mangalore
 
and
 
Nimbahera.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
assessment
 
process,
 
a
 
suitable
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
was
 
meticulously
 
designed
 
to
 
measure
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
key
 
focus
 
areas,
 
including
 
health,
 
education,
 
environment,
 
livelihood,
 
and
 
rural
 
infrastructure
 
development.
 
Field
 
visits
 
were
 
conducted
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
beneﬁciaries
 
and
 
stakeholders,
 
enabling
 
the
 
collection
 
of
 
primary
 
data
 
through
 
surveys,
 
interviews,
 
and
 
focus
 
group
 
discussions.
 
 
The
 
data
 
collected
 
was
 
analysed
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impact
 
of
 
CSR
 
interventions
 
on
 
both
 
the
 
targeted
 
beneﬁciaries
 
and
 
the
 
wider
 
community.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
assessment
 
sought
 
to
 
identify
 
success
 
stories,
 
best
 
practices,
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
 
within
 
the
 
CSR
 
initiatives.
 
Furthermore,
 
we
 
conducted
 
an
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
existing
 
monitoring
 
and
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
employed
 
by
 
JK
 
Cement,
 
providing
 
recommendations
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
and
 
inclusive
 
framework
 
that
 
encompasses
 
all
 
domains.

programs.
 
This
 
forms
 
the
 
basis
 
for
 
implementing
 
the
 
approach
 
in
 
the
 
present
 
study,
 
which
 
aims
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
sentiments
 
and
 
impact
 
of
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
CSR
 
initiatives.
 
2.2
 
Holistic
 
and
 
Comprehensive
 
Development
 
Model
 
The
 
Integrated
 
Community
 
Development
 
(ICD)
 
approach
 
highlights
 
its
 
effectiveness
 
in
 
dealing
 
with
 
multifaceted
 
aspects
 
of
 
rural
 
development,
 
positioning
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
leading
 
strategy
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
-Arikawei
 
(2015)
 
.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
International
 
Council
 
for
 
Adult
 
Education
 
(ICAE,
 
2006),
 
the
 
essence
 
of
 
ICD
 
is
 
to
 
achieve
 
development
 
that
 
fosters
 
social,
 
economic,
 
and
 
political
 
justice,
 
leading
 
to
 
effectively
 
addressing
 
the
 
complex
 
nexus
 
among
 
poverty,
 
disease,
 
and
 
illiteracy.
 
2.3
 
Reference
 
Points
 
for
 
development
 
model-PMAGY
 
The
 
integrated
 
community
 
development
 
concept
 
is
 
integral
 
to
 
the
 
Pradhan
 
Mantri
  
Adarsh
 
Gram
 
Yojana
 
(PMAGY).
 
Within
 
this
 
framework,
 
the
 
idea
 
of
 
a
 
model
 
village
 
is
 
emphasised
 
for
 
holistic
 
community
 
development.
 
 
A
 
model
 
village,
 
as
 
per
 
PMAGY,
 
possesses
 
sufﬁcient
 
physical
 
and
 
institutional
 
infrastructure,
 
meets
 
the
 
minimum
 
needs
 
of
 
all
 
sections
 
of
 
society,
 
fosters
 
harmony
 
among
 
residents
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
environment,
 
and
 
is
 
characterised
 
by
 
progress
 
and
 
dynamism.
 
 
Those
 
villages
 
should
 
offer
 
all
 
necessary
 
facilities
 
for
 
digniﬁed
 
living,
 
enabling
 
residents
 
to
 
maximise
 
their
 
potential.
 
PMAGY
 
recommends
 
the
 
private
 
corporate
 
sector
 
in
 
aligning
 
its
 
initiatives
 
with
 
Corporate
 
Social
 
Responsibility
 
(CSR)
  
(PMAGY,
 
2015).
  
JK
 
Cement
 
will
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
realisation
 
of
 
an
 
Integrated
 
Community
 
Development
 
model,
 
helping
 
villages
 
meet
 
the
 
criteria
 
of
 
an
 
Adarsh
 
Gram.
 
 
 
 
 

 
2.4
 
Participatory
 
and
 
collaborative
 
approach
 
Community
 
development
 
is
 
perceived
 
as
 
a
 
purposeful
 
endeavor
 
aimed
 
at
 
fortifying
 
the
 
cohesion
 
of
 
a
 
&quot;community
 
ﬁeld.&quot;
 
Summers
 
(1986)
 
emphasizes
 
that
 
it
 
involves
 
deliberate
 
actions
 
to
 
initiate
 
and
 
sustain
 
channels
 
of
 
communication
 
and
 
cooperation
 
among
 
various
 
local
 
groups.
 
The
 
essence
 
of
 
community
 
development
 
lies
 
in
 
building
 
connections
 
and
 
collaboration,
 
enabling
 
collective
 
efforts
 
among
 
community
 
members.
 
This
 
collaborative
 
approach
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
contributing
 
to
 
the
 
overall
 
well-being
 
of
 
the
 
community.
 
2.5
 
Strategic
 
alignment
 
and
 
development
 
roadmap
 
Rural
 
community
 
development,
 
crucial
 
for
 
social
 
change,
 
is
 
effectively
 
driven
 
by
 
Corporate
 
Social
 
Responsibility
 
(CSR)
 
initiatives.
 
Prioritizing
 
collaboration
 
with
 
local
 
communities
 
and
 
organizations
 
maximizes
 
beneﬁts,
 
as
 
per
 
Kaushal
 
(2019).
 
Aligning
 
initiatives
 
with
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goals
 
(SDGs)
 
not
 
only
 
contributes
 
to
 
global
 
sustainability
 
but
 
also
 
addresses
 
local
 
priorities,
 
building
 
collaborative
 
relationships.
 
This
 
strategic
 
alignment
 
is
 
not
 
only
 
a
 
societal
 
responsibility
 
but
 
also
 
enhances
 
long-term
 
viability
 
and
 
stakeholder
 
trust.
 
Integrated
 
Community
 
Development
 
emerges
 
as
 
a
 
holistic
 
assessment
 
approach,
 
aligning
 
outcomes
 
with
 
SDGs
 
and
 
corporate
 
imperatives,
 
capturing
 
local
 
needs
 
effectively.

Methodology
 
The
 
reconnaissance
 
visit
 
was
 
conducted
 
by
 
Team
 
CMS
 
with
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
gaining
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
geography,
 
demography,
 
and
 
implementation
 
status
 
of
 
various
 
interventions
 
across
 
different
 
domains
 
in
 
the
 
region.
 
During
 
the
 
visit,
 
all
 
interventions
 
were
 
examined,
 
and
 
interactions
 
were
 
held
 
with
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
beneﬁciaries
 
from
 
different
 
domain
 
areas.
 
The
 
insights
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
reconnaissance
 
visit
 
were
 
instrumental
 
in
 
developing
 
tools
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
interventions
 
on
 
the
 
community.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
visit
 
aimed
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
community's
 
sentiment
 
towards
 
the
 
work
 
undertaken
 
by
 
JK
 
Cement
 
and
 
their
 
overall
 
perception
 
of
 
the
 
organisation.
 
After
 
comprehensively
 
understanding
 
the
 
model
 
of
 
interventions
 
and
 
the
 
framework
 
of
 
the
 
CSR
 
initiatives,
 
the
 
team
 
conducted
 
a
 
detailed
 
secondary
 
literature
 
review
 
on
 
various
 
aspects
 
constituting
 
the
 
approach
 
of
 
Integrated
 
Community
 
Development
 
and
 
others.
 
This
 
literature
 
review
 
provided
 
valuable
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
existing
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
region,
 
offering
 
a
 
broader
 
perspective
 
on
 
the
 
context
 
and
 
previous
 
efforts
 
undertaken
 
in
 
similar
 
domains.
 
This
 
study
 
employs
 
a
 
mixed-method
 
approach
,
 
utilizing
 
a
 
non-experimental
 
design
 
for
 
the
 
impact
 
assessment.

was
 
applied
 
to
 
capture
 
the

with
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
proximate
 
areas
 
where
 
the
 
JK

are
 
located:
 
the
 
Nimbahera

in
 
the
 
Chittorgarh

of
 
Rajasthan
 
State.

limitations
 
The
 
absence
 
of
 
a
 
systematic
 
approach
 
to
 
identifying
 
community
 
needs,
 
along
 
with
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
bottom-up
 
targeted
 
solutions
 
and
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
development
 
roadmap,
 
combined
 
with
 
a
 
decentralized
 
structure
 
and
 
prioritized
 
interventions,
 
may
 
diminish
 
the
 
impact,
 
scale,
 
and
 
sustainability
 
of
 
initiatives.
 
Furthermore,
 
limitations
 
in
 
the
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation,
 
and
 
Learning
 
(MEL)
 
system,
 
including
 
insufﬁcient
 
documentation,
 
absence
 
of

framework,
 
and
 
Theory

(ToC),
 
pose
 
challenges
 
in
 
assessing
 
expected
 
outputs
 
against
 
organizational
 
inputs
 
and
 
activities.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
uneven
 
distribution
 
of
 
interventions
 
across
 
villages
 
presented
 
challenges
 
in
 
identifying
 
beneﬁciaries
 
for
 
data
 
collection.
 
Moreover,
 
confusion
 
regarding
 
the
 
services
 
provided
 
by
 
JK
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
CSR
 
initiatives
 
from
 
other
 
companies
 
in
 
the

further
 
complicated

efforts.
 
 
Conclusion:
 
The
 
methodology,
 
reconnaissance
 
visit
 
ﬁndings,
 
and
 
inputs
 
from
 
the
 
CSR
 
team
 
were
 
incorporated
 
into
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
the
 
tools.
 
Subsequently,
 
the
 
data
 
collected
 
was
 
analyzed
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
agreed-upon
 
methodology.

Results
 
and
 
Findings
 
The
 
ﬁndings
 
of
 
the
 
impact
 
assessment
 
comprise
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collected.
 
The
 
data
 
was
 
analysed
 
domain-wise
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
structured
 
perspective
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
within
 
each
 
domain.
 
These
 
ﬁndings
 
not
 
only
 
highlight
 
the
 
gaps
 
in
 
the
 
domain
 
areas
 
but
 
also
 
serve
 
as
 
the
 
basis
 
for
 
formulating
 
recommendations.
 
 
4.1
 
Demographic
 
Proﬁle
 
 
 
 
From
 
the
 
responses
 
gathered,
 
it
 
is
 
evident
 
that
 
the
 
largest
 
group
 
beneﬁting
 
from
 
JK
 
CSR
 
Interventions
 
belongs
 
to
 
the
 
Other
 
Backward
 
Classes
 
(OBC),
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
Scheduled
 
Caste
 
(SC)
 
and
 
Scheduled
 
Tribe
 
(ST)
 
categories.
 
 
As
 
per
 
Census
 
2011
 
data,
 
the
 
SC/ST
 
population
 
comprises
 
25.6%
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
population
 
of
 
1,544,000
 
in
 
Chittorgarh
 
district.
 
Therefore,
 
this
 
validates
 
the
 
lesser
 
number
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries
 
in
 
the
 
SC/ST
 
category.
 
Fig
 
2:
 
Social
 
Category
 
 
Income
 
of
 
Beneﬁciaries
 
The
 
majority
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries
 
were
 
found
 
to
 
be
 
engaged
 
in
 
farming
 
and
 
cattle-rearing
 
activities.
 
Our
 
reconnaissance
 
visit
 
revealed
 
that
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
was
 
involved
 
in
 
agricultural
 
and
 
related
 
endeavours.
 
Additionally,
 
a
 
considerable
 
number
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries
 
held
 
employment
 
in
 
various
 
cement
 
corporations
 
across
 
the
 
region.
 
Additionally,
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
273
 
responses
 
received,
 
a
 
larger
 
proportion
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries,
 
speciﬁcally
 
178
 
individuals,
 
were
 
classiﬁed
 
as
 
above
 
the
 
poverty
 
line
 
compared
 
to
 
154
  
individuals
 
classiﬁed
 
as
 
below
 
the
 
poverty
 
line.

However,
 
it
 
is
 
notable
 
that
 
the
 
reported
 
monthly
 
income
 
 
of
 
these
 
beneﬁciaries
 
amounted
 
to
 
INR
 
15,000.

CC
 
Roads
 
The
 
community
 
has
 
reported
 
a
 
positive
 
experience
 
regarding
 
the
 
construction
 
of
 
CC
 
roads
 
in
 
their
 
village,
 
with
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
respondents
 
grading
 
the
 
state
 
connectivity
 
of
 
the
 
roads
 
as
 
good
 
to
 
excellent.
 
The
 
construction
 
of
 
CC
 
roads
 
has
 
signiﬁcantly
 
enhanced
 
the
 
travel
 
experience
 
for
 
community
 
members,
 
reducing
 
their
 
travel
 
time.
 
 
Previously,
 
uneven
 
roads
 
and
 
numerous
 
potholes
 
caused
 
water
 
accumulation,
 
which
 
facilitated
 
mosquito
 
breeding
 
grounds
 
and
 
contributed
 
to
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
waterborne
 
diseases
 
within
 
the
 
society.

Moreover,
 
businesses
 
faced
 
challenges
 
in
 
transporting
 
goods
 
due
 
to
 
road
 
conditions,
 
but
 
with
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
CC
 
roads,
 
this
 
has
 
become
 
much
 
smoother,
 
preventing
 
damage
 
to
 
goods
 
during
 
transportation.
 
4.2.2
 
Application
 
of
 
Roads
 
 
The
 
construction
 
of
 
CC
 
roads
 
has
 
yielded
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
outcome
 
by
 
connecting
 
prime
 
locations,
 
thereby
 
simplifying
 
commuting
 
for
 
community
 
members.
 
These
 
roads
 
have
 
facilitated
 
greater
 
connectivity
 
with
 
the
 
main
 
road,
 
expanding
 
access
 
to
 
markets,
 
block
 
hospitals,
 
and
 
schools.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
main
 
road
 
leads
 
to
 
the
 
market
 
area
 
and
 
links
 
villages
 
to
 
Nimbahera,
 
where
 
better
 
services
 
are
 
available
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
markets,
 
healthcare,
 
and
 
other
 
essential
 
amenities,
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
improved
 
connectivity
 
on
 
overall
 
accessibility
 
and
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
residents
 
is
 
noteworthy.

poses
 
a
 
challenge.
 
Despite
 
these
 
concerns,
 
the

is
 
adequately

with
 
essential
 
facilities
 
to
 
accommodate

However,
 
adhering
 
to
 
Hindu
 
customs,
 
mourners
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
bathe
 
after

Consequently,
 
there
 
is
 
a

In
 
the
 
region,
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
artiﬁcial
 
insemination
 
has
 
led
 
farmers
 
to
 
transition
 
from
 
the
 
'Desi'
 
breed
 
to
 
improved
 
cow
 
breeds,
 
increasing
 
milk
 
production
 
from
 
3-4
 
to
 
9-10
 
litres
 
per
 
day.
 
This
 
shift
 
has
 
prompted
 
many
 
farmers
 
to
 
upgrade
 
to
 
higher-quality
 
cattle,
 
expanding
 
their
 
livestock
 
from
 
2-3
 
cows
 
to
 
7-10
 
cows
 
and
 
buffaloes.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
farmers
 
now
 
supply
 
milk
 
to
 
the
 
Saras
 
Milk
 
Cooperative
 
and
 
offer
 
door-to-door
 
delivery
 
services,
 
priced
 
at
 
INR
 
35
 
per
 
litre
 
for
 
cow
 
milk
 
and
 
INR
 
50
 
per
 
litre
 
for
 
buffalo
 
milk.
 
Some
 
 


 
farmers
 
have
 
also
 
diversiﬁed
 
into
 
value-added
 
products
 
like
 
ghee
 
and
 
cottage
 
cheese,
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improving
 
their
 
economic

and
 
household
 
income.

After
 
acquiring
 
the
 
necessary
 
skills
 
and
 
resources,
 
individuals
 
have
 
transformed
 
these
 
assets
 
into
 
income-generating
 
activities,
 
thereby
 
improving
 
their
 
economic
 
standing.
 
Previously
 
limited
 
to
 
meeting
 
family
 
needs,
 
farmers
 
have
 
expanded
 
their
 
milk
 
production
 
into
 
viable
 
businesses.
 
Similarly,
 
women
 
skilled
 
in
 
tailoring

have
 
turned
 
their
 
hobbies
 
into
 
sources

The

outlines
 
the
 
anticipated
 
milk
 
production
 
from
 
cows
 
that
 
have
 
undergone
 
Artiﬁcial
 
Insemination
 
(AI)
 
and
 
the
 
subsequent
 
offspring.
 
With
 
an
 
assumed

production
 
of
 
7
 
litres
 
per
 
cow
 
over
 
a
 
span
 
of
 
200
 
days,
 
the
 
gross
 
income
 
from
 
milk
 
sales
 
is
 
estimated
 
at
 
INR
 
2,94,000.
 
After
 
factoring
 
in
 
approximate
 
livestock
 
care
 
expenses
 
of
 
INR
 
80,000,
 
the
 
projected
 
net
 
income
 
stands
 
at
 
approximately
  
INR
 
2,00000
 
per
 
family
 
in
 
a
 
year.
 
 
 
The
 
skill
 
development
 
in
 
tailoring
 
among
 
women
 
has
 
created
 
opportunities
 
for
 
home-based
 
earning.
 
While
 
initial
 
investment
 
in
 
sewing
 
machines
 
varies,
 
income
 
from
 
stitching
 
garments,
 
especially
 
during
 
festivals,
 
amounts
 
to
 
approximately
 
INR
 
5000
 
per
 
month.
 
After
 
deducting
 
expenses
 
for
 
thread,
 
machine
 
oil,
 
and
 
other
 
materials,
 
the
 
net
 
monthly
 
income
 
averages
 
around
 
INR
 
4800.
 
Moreover,
 
with
 
the
 
guidance
 
of
 
cattle
 
experts
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
cattle
 
medicines
 
provided
 
through

have
 
witnessed
 
signiﬁcant
 
improvements
 
in
 
the
 
quality
 
 


 
of
 
their

This
 
support
 
has
 
not
 
only
 
led
 
to
 
increased
 
income
 
levels
 
for
 
many
 
farmers
 
but
 
has
 
also
 
enhanced
 
their
 
entrepreneurial

Despite

86%

Preventing
 
Infection:
 
The
 
Lumpy
 
Story
 
 
In
 
August
 
2022,
 
Rajasthan
 
witnessed
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
outbreak
 
of
 
lumpy
 
skin
 
disease,
 
affecting
 
nearly
 
94,000
 
cattle.
 
JK
 
Cement
 
responded
 
swiftly
 
by
 
organizing
 
large-scale
 
vaccination
 
drives,
 
reaching
 
approximately
 
86%
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries.
 
Focus
 
Group
 
Discussions
 
highlighted
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
early
 
vaccination
 
in
 
containing
 
the
 
disease.
 
Beyond
 
immediate
 
control,
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
intervention
 
aimed
 
at
 
long-term
 
livestock
 
health
 
improvement,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
reduction
 
in
 
lumpy
 
disease
 
cases
 
over
 
time.
 
The
 
community
 
positively
 
responded
 
to
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
active
 
involvement,
 
contrasting
 
it
 
with
 
the
 
perceived
 
inactivity
 
of
 
other
 
corporations.
 
This
 
reﬂects
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
commitment
 
to
 
corporate
 
social
 
responsibility
 
and
 
its
 
proactive
 
approach
 
to
 
supporting
 
communities
 
during
 
crises.

Impactful
 
COVID-19
 
Relief
 
Measures
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
relief
 
efforts
 
during
 
the
 
COVID-19
 
pandemic,
 
particularly
 
through
 
mask
 
and
 
PPE
 
kit
 
distribution,
 
were
 
crucial
 
for
 
community
 
safety,
 
as
 
noted
 
by
 
69%
 
of
 
beneﬁciaries.
 
However,
 
19%
 
of
 
households
 
remained
 
unaware
 
of
 
these
 
initiatives,
 
suggesting
 
a
 
communication
 
gap
 
that
 
needs
 
addressing
 
to
 
ensure
 
equitable
 
access
 
to
 
relief
 
measures.
 
 


 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
pandemic-related
 
relief,
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
sanitation
 
initiatives
 
garnered
 
positive
 
feedback,
 
especially
 
the
 
multiple
 
rounds
 
of
 
sanitation
 
spraying
 
in
 
areas
 
like
 
Phachar
 
and
 
Murliya.
 
This
 
proactive
 
approach
 
not
 
only
 
aligns
 
with
 
global
 
health
 
guidelines
 
but
 
also
 
directly
 
addresses
 
the
 
expressed

of
 
the

It
 
underscores
 
JK

and
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
holistic

Their
 
key

include
 
school

This
 
includes
 
the
 
building
 
of

and
 
a
 
library,
 
water

in
 
the

A
 
limitation
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
we
 
have
 
conducted
 
shows
 
that
 
outcomes
 
such
 
as
 
enrollment
 
and
 
attendance
 
cannot
 
be
 
ascertained
 
and
 
correlated
 
with
 
educational

This
 
can
 
be
 
explored
 
with
 
a
 
longitudinal
 
research
 
study.

The
 
educational
 
resources
 
provided
 
by
 
JK
 
Cement
 
are
 
easily
 
accessible
 
for
 
about
 
52%
 
of
 
respondents
 
followed
 
by
 
44%
 
of
 
respondents
 
highlighting
 
limited
 
access.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
uneven
 
distribution
 
of
 
educational
 
resources.
 
Despite
 
the
 
company's
 
focus
 
on
 
infrastructure
 
development,
 
the
 
distribution
 
of
 
essential
 
resources
 
such
 
as
 
books,
 
water,
 
and
 
uniforms
 
across
 
villages
 
has
 
been
 
uneven.
 
This
 
disparity
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
limited
 
access
 
for
 
many
 
beneﬁciaries.
 
This
 
ﬁnding
 
is
 
also
 
supported
 
by
 
qualitative
 
interviews
 
in
 
which
 
beneﬁciaries
 
responded
 
that
 
the
 
sports
 
stadium
 
is
 
in
 
Mangrol
 
and
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
geographical
 
proximity
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
barrier
 
to

Conclusion
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
CSR
 
initiatives
 
in
 
Nimbahera
 
district,
 
Rajasthan,
 
demonstrate
 
a
 
holistic
 
approach
 
to
 
rural
 
community
 
development,
 
addressing
 
social,
 
economic,
 
and
 
environmental
 
challenges.
 
Through
 
participatory
 
decision-making
 
and
 
resource
 
mobilization,
 
they've
 
facilitated
 
development
 
across
 
28
 
villages
 
near
 
Nimbahera
 
City
 
over
 
three
 
years.
 
The
 
literature
 
review
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
Integrated
 
Community
 
Development
 
(ICD)
 
and
 
participatory
 
approaches,
 
aligning
 
with
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goals
 
(SDGs).
 
Their
 
methodology,
 
including
 
reconnaissance
 
visits
 
and
 
thorough
 
community
 
engagement,
 
ensures
 
rigorous
 
evaluation.
 
Findings
 
indicate
 
tangible
 
beneﬁts
 
like
 
economic
 
growth,
 
social
 
cohesion,
 
improved
 
quality
 
of
 
life,
 
and
 
enhanced
 
community
 
health.
 
Notable
 
improvements
 
include
 
rural
 
infrastructure,
 
livelihood
 
opportunities,
 
healthcare
 
access,
 
water
 
supply,
 
disaster
 
resilience,
 
and
 
education.
 
 


 
 
To
 
sustain
 
positive
 
outcomes
 
and
 
address
 
ongoing
 
challenges,
 
such
 
as
 
resource
 
distribution
 
and
 
water
 
shortages,
 
continued
 
commitment
 
and
 
collaboration
 
with
 
stakeholders
 
are
 
essential.
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
dedication
 
to
 
rural
 
development
 
can
 
foster
 
resilient
 
and
 
empowered
 
communities
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
term.

Recommendations
 
6.1
 
Strategic
 
Recommendations
 
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
CSR
 
interventions
 
need
 
to
 
focus
 
more
 
on
 
the
 
supply
 
side,
 
particularly
 
in
 
catalysing
 
conversion
 
efforts
 
related
 
to
 
ﬁnance,
 
markets,
 
advocacy,
 
and
 
governance.
 
This
 
entails
 
identifying
 
and
 
engaging
 
with
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
governance
 
mechanism
 
that
 
can
 
effectively
 
capture
 
community
 
needs
 
and
 
demands.
 
By
 
actively
 
involving
 
stakeholders
 
in
 
activity
 
planning,
 
budget
 
allocation,
 
and
 
resource
 
management,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
can
 
ensure
 
that
 
its
 
initiatives
 
align
 
with
 
both
 
grassroots
 
and
 
political
 
interests.
 
 
 
To
 
facilitate
 
holistic
 
community
 
development,
 
it's
 
imperative
 
to
 
develop
 
an
 
Integrated
 
Community
 
Development
 
Index,
 
inspired
 
by
 
the
 
Adarsh
 
Gram
 
Panchayat
 
Development
 
Model
 
and
 
GPDP.
 
This
 
index
 
will
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
framework
 
for
 
assessing
 
progress
 
across
 
various
 
domains,
 
guiding
 
the
 
allocation
 
of
 
resources,
 
and
 
evaluating
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
interventions.
 
A
 
strategic
 
approach
 
involves
 
initiating
 
a
 
pilot
 
program
 
and
 
crafting
 
a
 
detailed
 
Action
 
Plan
 
spanning
 
3
 
to
 
5
 
years.
 
This
 
plan
 
should
 
outline
 
clear
 
priorities,
 
set
 
achievable
 
targets,
 
and
 
establish
 
thematic
 
areas
 
of
 
focus.
 
By
 
adopting
 
this
 
structured
 
approach,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
can
 
enhance
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
and
 
sustainability
 
of
 
its
 
CSR
 
initiatives
 
while
 
promoting
 
meaningful
 
socio-economic
 
development
 
in
 
the
 
communities
 
it
 
serves.
 
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
need
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
focus
 
on
 
a
 
catalytic
 
and
 
collaborative
 
model-orchestrate,
 
inﬂuence
 
and
 
solve(
https://communityactioncollab.org/action
)
 
rather
 
than
 
a
 
delivering
 
and
 
implementation
 
model.
 
JK's
 
CSR
 
interventions
 
currently
 
lack
 
structured
 
planning
 
and
 
stakeholder
 
engagement.
 
It's
 
crucial
 
to
 
involve
 
key
 
stakeholders,
 
identify
 
vulnerable
 
communities,
 
and
 
prioritise
 
thematic
 
areas
 
for
 
intervention.
 
Collaboration
 
with
 
Farmer
 
Producer
 
Organizations
 
(FPOs)
 
and
 
other
 
market
 
players
 
is
 
essential
 
for
 
holistic
 
development
 
initiatives.
 
For
 
instance,
 
partnering
 
with
 
organisations
 
like
 
Godrej
 
to
 
facilitate
 
women's
 
skill
 
development
 
aligned
 
with
 
market
 
demands
 
and
 
Vrutti
 
to
 
enhance
 
farm-related
 
sectors.
 
This
 
approach
 
will
 
ensure
 
more
 
effective
 
and
 
impactful
 
CSR
 
initiatives.
 
 
 

 
The
 
stakeholder
 
engagement
 
currently
 
follows
 
a
 
top-down
 
and
 
ad
 
hoc
 
approach,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
weaker
 
governance
 
mechanism
 
that
 
impacts
 
budgeting,
 
priority
 
setting,
 
timelines,
 
and
 
resource
 
allocation.
 
It's
 
vital
 
to
 
transition
 
towards
 
a
 
more
 
structured
 
and
 
inclusive
 
approach,
 
with
 
regular
 
and
 
agenda-speciﬁc
 
engagement
 
mechanisms
 
involving
 
key
 
ofﬁcials,
 
community
 
members,
 
and
 
stakeholders.
 
This
 
shift
 
will
 
foster
 
structured
 
planning
 
and
 
stakeholder
 
engagement,
 
enabling
 
the
 
identiﬁcation
 
of
 
vulnerable
 
communities
 
and
 
prioritisation
 
of
 
intervention
 
areas.
 
Reliance
 
Foundation's
 
approach
 
to
 
catalysing
 
community
 
leadership
 
through
 
Rural
 
Institutions
 
serves
 
as
 
a

Rural
 
Transformation
 
In
 
the
 
realm
 
of
 
rural
 
transformation,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
can
 
collaborate
 
with
 
Gram
 
Panchayats
 
to
 
establish
 
parks
 
and
 
public
 
spaces
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Gram
 
Panchayat
 
Development
 
Plan
 
(GPDP)
 
or
 
the
 
Pradhan
 
Mantri
 
Gramin
 
Awaas
 
Yojana
 
(PMGAY).
 
Additionally,
 
prioritising
 
repairs,
 
renovations,
 
and
 
maintenance
 
of
 
key
 
infrastructure
 
such
 
as
 
schools,
 
hospitals,
 
and
 
community
 
facilities
 
is
 
essential.
 
Implementing
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
construction
 
management
 
framework
 
will
 
streamline
 
execution,
 
ensuring
 
cost-effectiveness
 
and
 
maintaining
 
high-quality
 
standards.
 
This
 
approach
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
enhance
 
the
 
physical
 
infrastructure
 
but
 
also
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
overall
 
socio-economic
 
 

 
development
 
of
 
rural
 
areas.

Health
 
To
 
enhance
 
its
 
impact
 
on
 
community
 
health,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
should
 
employ
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
approach.
 
This
 
involves
 
implementing
 
healthcare
 
interventions
 
covering
 
preventive,
 
curative,
 
and
 
diagnostic
 
measures
 
for
 
prevalent
 
diseases.
 
Collaborating
 
closely
 
with
 
the
 
public
 
healthcare
 
system
 
and
 
village
 
healthcare
 
workers
 
like
 
ASHAs,
 
ANMs,
 
and
 
Anganwadi
 
workers
 
will
 
expand
 
outreach
 
and
 
engagement,
 
leveraging
 
existing
 
community
 
connections.
 
By
 
adopting
 
a
 
holistic
 
health
 
perspective
 
addressing
 
nutrition,
 
sanitation,
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
can
 
contribute
 
to
 
sustainable
 
improvements
 
in
 
community
 
well-being.
 
Furthermore,
 
integrating
 
healthcare
 
initiatives
 
with
 
infrastructure
 
projects,
 
such
 
as
 
hospital
 
construction
 
or
 
medical
 
camps,
 
ensures
 
efﬁcient
 
resource
 
utilisation
 
and
 
long-term
 
beneﬁts
 
for
 
community
 
health.
 
Additionally,
 
strengthening
 
community
 
systems
 
and
 
integrating
 
initiatives
 
like
 
POSHAN,
 
Pradhan
 
Mantri
 
Matru
 
Vandana
 
Yojana
 
(PMMVY),
 
and
 
the
 
National
 
Programme
 
for
 
Healthcare
 
of
 
the
 
Elderly
 
(NPHCE)
 
will
 
further
 
enhance
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
healthcare
 
interventions.
 
Please
 
review
 
the
 
model
 
of

Education
 
To
 
maximise
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
its
 
sports
 
initiatives,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
should
 
strategically
 
expand
 
collaborations
 
with
 
local
 
sports
 
associations
 
and
 
schools,
 
integrating
 
structured
 
sports
 
programs
 
to
 
increase
 
awareness
 
and
 
participation
 
among
 
beneﬁciaries
 
while
 
aligning
 
with
 
community
 
interests.
 
Prioritising
 
infrastructure
 
enhancement
 
by
 
providing
 
necessary
 
amenities
 
for
 
all
 
genders
 
during
 
tournaments
 
will
 
create
 
a
 
more
 
inclusive
 
environment.
 
Clear
 
communication
 
and
 
branding
 
efforts
 
are
 
crucial
 
to
 
ensure
 
beneﬁciaries
 
understand
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
contributions
 
to
 
community
 
development,
 
enhancing
 
transparency.
 
 
To
 
further
 
engage
 
students
 
and
 
promote
 
their
 
interest
 
in
 
education,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
should
 
organise
 
additional
 
activities
 
like
 
essay
 
writing,
 
and
 
cultural,
 
and
 
sports
 
competitions
 
at
 
the
 
district/block
 
level.
 
These
 
initiatives
 
will
 
encourage
 
student
 
participation
 
and
 
foster
 
camaraderie
 
and
 
healthy
 
competition.
 
Complementing
 
school
 
infrastructure
 
construction
 
with
 
these
 
events
 
can
 
create
 
a
 
holistic
 
educational
 
environment
 
that
 
nurtures
 
both
 
academic
 
and
 
non-academic
 
talents.
 
It's
 
recommended
 
to
 
provide
 
solutions
 
for
 
children
 
from
 
government
 
schools
 
and
 
low-income
 
 

 
communities,
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
school
 
education
 
for
 
all
 
children

with
 
the
 
resources
 
to
 
complete
 
secondary
 
education
 
and
 
gain

provides
 
positive
 
reinforcement
 
of
 
life
 
skills,
 
especially
 
for

Educating
 
girls
 
serves
 
to
 
have
 
them
 
continue
 
to
 
college,
 
marry
 
much
 
later,
 
have
 
fewer

Livelihood
 
 
In
 
the
 
domain
 
of
 
livelihood
 
enhancement,
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
CSR
 
initiatives
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
several
 
key
 
areas
 
to
 
uplift
 
the
 
community.
 
Investing
 
in
 
capacity
 
building
 
for
 
Milk
 
Cooperative
 
Societies
 
can
 
empower
 
farmers
 
with
 
the
 
knowledge
 
and
 
skills
 
for
 
value
 
addition
 
services
 
such
 
as
 
Paneer,
 
Butter,
 
and
 
Ghee
 
production,
 
thereby
 
increasing
 
their
 
income
 
opportunities.
 
Additionally,
 
establishing
 
partnerships
 
with
 
farmers
 
through
 
Farmer
 
Producer
 
Organizations
 
(FPOs)
 
can
 
facilitate
 
access
 
to
 
subsidies
 
for
 
seeds,
 
distribution
 
of
 
supplements,
 
and
 
procurement
 
support,
 
promoting
 
sustainable
 
agricultural
 
practices.
 
Moreover,
 
providing
 
feedstock
 
for
 
industries,
 
such
 
as
 
Hay
 
and
 
Stubble,
 
can
 
create
 
additional
 
revenue
 
streams
 
for
 
farmers
 
while
 
promoting
 
environmental
 
sustainability.
 
Lastly,
 
offering
 
skill
 
development
 
programs
 
tailored
 
to
 
household-centric
 
income
 
generation
 
activities,
 
particularly
 
in
 
ﬁelds
 
like
 
tailoring,
 
can
 
empower
 
women
 
economically.
 
Ensuring
 
the
 
accessibility
 
of
 
these
 
skill
 
development
 
initiatives
 
to
 
all
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
community
 
will
 
promote
 
inclusivity
 
and
 
facilitate
 
economic
 
empowerment
 
at
 
the
 
grassroots
 
level.

Environment
 
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
future
 
CSR
 
initiatives
 
in
 
environmental
 
conservation
 
and
 
water
 
resource
 
management
 
can
 
aim
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
challenges
 
associated
 
with
 
insufﬁcient
 
access
 
to
 
water
 
resources.
 
These
 
efforts
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
provisioning
 
water
 
to
 
tanks
 
and
 
pipelines
 
to
 
improve
 
local
 
communities
 
access
 
to
 
clean
 
water
 
and
 
ensure
 
better
 
control
 
and
 
distribution
 
of
 
water
 
resources.
 
Sustainable
 
water
 
supply
 
measures
 
can
 
be
 
implemented
 
to
 
enhance
 
resilience
 
during
 
droughts
 
or
 
water
 
scarcity
 
periods.
 
Additionally,
 
initiatives
 
can
 
target
 
increasing
 
groundwater
 
availability
 
and
 
improving
 
its
 
quality,
 
with
 
expected
 
increases
 
in
 
groundwater
 
levels
 
and
 
enhancement
 
in
 
water
 
quality
 
parameters
 
such
 
as
 
pH
 
and
 
COD/BOD
 
levels.
 
To
 
further
 
enhance
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
these
 
initiatives,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
can
 
consider
 
establishing
 
a
 
water
 
testing
 
facility
 
or
 
collaborating
 
with
 
organisations
 
specialising
 
in
 
water
 
quality
 
assessment
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
safe
 
and
 
high-quality
 
drinking
 
water.
 
Soil
 
testing
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
prioritised
 
to
 
support
 
agricultural
 
sustainability
 
and
 
crop
 
productivity.
 
 
Furthermore,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
sustainable
 
model
 
of
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
community
 
to
 
aspire,
 
and
 
acquire
 
the
 
capacity
 
and
 
knowledge
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
program.
 
The
 
environmental
 
initiatives
 
need
 
to
 
motivate
 
the
 
community
 
to
 
come
 
together
 
as
 
one
 
unit,
 
a
 
task
 
in
 
which
 
JK
 
Cement
 
has
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
to
 
mobilise
 
and
 
facilitate
 
through
 
existing
 
government
 
initiatives
 
and
 
formal
 
systems
 
such
 
as
 
Gram
 
Panchayats
 
or
 
Village
 
Development
 
Committees.
 
This
 
comprehensive
 
approach
 
should
 
encompass
 
climate
 
resilience,
 
soil
 
conservation,
 
the
 
promotion
 
of
 
solar
 
energy,
 
and
 
water
 
conservation
 
agricultural
 
practices.

6.3.6
 
Disaster
 
Relief
 
To
 
enhance
 
JK
 
Cement's
 
disaster
 
relief
 
measures,
 
it's
 
imperative
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
drought
 
mitigation
 
plan
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
region's
 
speciﬁc
 
hazards.
 
This
 
plan
 
should
 
encompass
 
strategies
 
such
 
as
 
water
 
conservation,
 
drought-resistant
 
agriculture,
 
and
 
community
 
education
 
on
 
effective
 
water
 
management
 
practices.
 
Additionally,
 
proactive
 
measures
 
to
 
address
 
other
 
potential
 
hazards
 
like
 
ﬂoods
 
or
 
landslides
 
should
 
be
 
seamlessly
 
integrated
 
into
 
the
 
disaster
 
preparedness
 
framework.
 
Clear
 
protocols
 
and
 
coordination
 
mechanisms
 
with
 
local
 
authorities,
 
emergency
 
response
 
teams,
 
and
 
community
 
organisations
 
must
 
be
 
established
 
to
 
ensure
 
swift
 
and
 
effective
 
responses
 
during
 
emergencies,
 
thereby
 
minimising
 
their
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
community
 
and
 
promoting
 
resilience.
 
 
Furthermore,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
should
 
pivot
 
its
 
CSR
 
interventions
 
towards
 
income-generating
 
initiatives
 
to
 
ensure
 
sustainability
 
and
 
lasting
 
impact.
 
Many
 
existing
 
interventions
 
suffer
 
from
 
inadequate
 
maintenance,
 
resulting
 
in
 
infrastructure
 
deterioration
 
over
 
time.
 
By
 
establishing
 
a
 
community-centric
 
maintenance
 
team,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
can
 
effectively
 
address
 
this
 
issue
 
and
 
uphold
 
the
 
longevity
 
of
 
its
 
projects.
 
This
 
strategic
 
shift
 
should
 
be
 
underpinned
 
by
 
a
 
thorough
 
review
 
of
 
the
 
community's
 
disaster
 
experiences,
 
encompassing
 
challenges
 
such
 
as
 
crop
 
failures,
 
livestock
 
diseases,
 
ﬁnancial
 
crises,
 
and
 
other
 
household-level
 
impacts.
 
Such
 
a
 
holistic
 
approach
 
will
 
enable
 
JK
 
Cement
 
to
 
tailor
 
its
 
interventions
 
to
 
the
 
community's
 
evolving
 
needs
 
and
 
enhance
 
its
 
overall
 
resilience
 
to
 
disasters.
 
Disaster
 
management
 
and
 
community
 
resilience
 
models
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
developed
 
and
 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
works
 
of
 
Aga
 
Khan
 
Foundation.
 
https://www.akrspindia.org.in/web/whatwedo/agricultureandclimateresilience
 
 
Furthermore,
 
providing
 
ﬁnancial
 
literacy
 
programs
 
for
 
women
 
and
 
youth
 
can
 
enhance
 
their
 
economic
 
empowerment.
 
Additionally,
 
looking
 
at
 
smartphone
 
digital
 
connectivity
 
and
 
offering
 
relevant
 
courses
 
for
 
youth
 
could
 
facilitate
 
their
 
skill
 
development.

devoted
 
its
 
efforts
 
to
 
fostering
 
rural
 
development
 
in
 
the
 
villages
 
of

The

commitment
 
to
 
various
 
facets
 
of
 
rural
 
development
 
is
 
evident
 
in
 
its
 
signiﬁcant
 
contributions.
 
Notably,
 
JK

has
 
prioritised
 
the
 
improvement
 
of
 
public
 
infrastructure,
 
focusing
 
on
 
essential
 
facilities
 
such
 
as
 
schools,
 
community
 
meeting

and
 
cremation
 
grounds.
 
These
 
initiatives
 
are
 
executed
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
and
 
guidance
 
from
 
community
 
leaders.
 
Another
 
crucial
 
facet
 
of

projects
 
involves
 
the
 
construction
 
of

in
 
elevating
 
the

Water
 
Management/Conservancy
 
 
JK

has
 
undertaken
 
signiﬁcant
 
initiatives
 
in
 
the
 
realm
 
of
 
water
 
conservation,
 
speciﬁcally
 
addressing
 
the
 
water-related
 
challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
communities
 
residing
 
in
 
the
 
vicinity
 
of
 
the
 
JK

Following
 
the
 
limestone
 
mining
 
process,
 
the
 
residual
 
water
 
that
 
surfaces
 
is
 
efﬁciently
 
channelled
 
to
 
a
 
water
 
tank
 
in
 
Paeri
 
village,
 
Nimbahera.
 
This
 
strategic
 
placement
 
of
 
the
 
water
 
tank
 
has
 
facilitated
 
the
 
installation
 
of
 
pipelines
 
in
 
the
 
adjacent
 
households,
 
ensuring
 
convenient
 
access
 
to
 
water
 
resources.
 
In
 
a
 
collaborative

with
 
the
 
Gram

JK

has
 
actively
 
contributed

of
 
a
 
pond
 
in
 
Nimbahera,
 
further
 
enhancing
 
water
 
management
 
in
 
the

implemented
 
a
 
systematic
 
transportation
 
system,
 
utilising
 
pipelines
 
to
 
convey
 
water
 
from
 
the
 
mining

to
 
the

on
 
a
 
consistent
 
basis.
 
This
 
comprehensive
 
approach
 
not
 
only
 
addresses
 
immediate

but
 
also
 
underscores

a
 
proactive
 
initiative
 
that
 
systematically
 
conducts

This

for
 
the
 
community,
 
demonstrating
 
a
 
commitment
 
to

Recently,
 
the
 
medical

operating
 
the

have
 
expanded
 
their

Recognizing
 
this,
 
JK

has
 
actively
 
contributed
 
to
 
the

aligning
 
with
 
the

dedication
 
to
 
fostering
 
educational
 
advancement.
 
In
 
a
 
bid
 
to
 
further
 
support
 
higher
 
studies,
 
JK
 
Cement
 
has
 
facilitated
 
the
 
establishment
 
of
 
a

This
 
resource
 
not
 
only
 
provides
 
students
 
in
 
the
 
area
 
with
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
shared

Environmental

importance
 
for
 
JK

reﬂecting
 
the
 
company's
 
dedicated
 
commitment
 
to
 
sustainable

In
 
alignment
 
with
 
this
 
commitment,
 
the
 
company
 
has
 
prioritised
 
afforestation
 
initiatives
 
as
 
a
 
proactive
 
measure.
 
Signiﬁcant

have
 
been
 
directed
 
towards
 
planting
 
trees
 
in
 
the
 
vicinity
 
of
 
schools
 
and
 
common
 
areas.
 
To
 
ensure
 
the
 
longevity
 
and
 
protection
 
of
 
these
 
planted
 
trees
 
and
 
plants,
 
JK

has
 
also
 
implemented
 
the
 
installation
 
of
 
protective

Moreover,
 
the

Methodology
 
This
 
study
 
employs
 
a
 
mixed-method
 
approach,
 
utilising
 
a
 
non-experimental
 
design
 
for
 
the
 
impact
 
assessment.
 
Quantitative
 
methods
 
will
 
be
 
applied
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
program's
 
status,
 
with
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
two
 
proximate
 
areas
 
where
 
the
 
JK
 
Cement
 
Plants
 
are
 
located:
 
the
 
Nimbahera
 
block
 
and
 
the
 
Mangrol
 
gram
 
panchayat
 
in
 
the
 
Chittorgarh
 
District
 
of
 
Rajasthan
 
State.
 
Following
 
the
 
quantitative
 
phase,
 
qualitative
 
methods
 
come
 
into
 
play
 
to
 
elaborate,
 
connect,
 
enhance,
 
illustrate,
 
and
 
clarify
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
from
 
the
 
quantitative
 
analysis.
 
This
 
sequential
 
approach
 
facilitates
 
a
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
and
 
in-depth
 
exploration
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁndings,
 
providing
 
a
 
nuanced
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
association
 
between
 
program
 
output
 
and
 
its
 
ultimate
 
impact.

across
 
distinct
 
domains,

as
 
can
 
be
 
seen
 
in

It

possible
 
that

might
 
beneﬁt

as
 
they
 
already
 
have

will
 
be
 
facilitated
 
with
 
qualiﬁed

through
 
a

The

Quantitative
 
Analysis
 
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
split
 
between
 
a
 
student
 
survey
 
and
 
a
 
parent
 
survey
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
advanced
 
statistical
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
Stata.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
parents
 
assessment
 
will
 
be
 
facilitated
 
with
 
qualiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
through
 
a
 
CAPI
 
administered
 
tool.
 
All
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
carried
 
out
 
in
 
stages.
 
At
 
ﬁrst,
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as
 
mean,
 
median,
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
quartile
 
or
 
decile
 
distribution
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
along
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
cross-tabulations.
 
Then
 
as
 
a
 
second
 
step,
 
causality
 
would
 
be
 
established
 
using
 
econometric
 
methods
 
as
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
identiﬁcation
 
methodology
 
adopted
 
for
 
evaluations.
 
This

Confidentiality
 
and
 
Ethical
 
Considerations
 
 
Ensuring
 
anonymity
 
and
 
protecting
 
respondent
 
identity
 
is
 
a
 
mandatory
 
requirement,
 
and
 
our
 
organisation
 
adheres
 
to
 
stringent
 
protocols
 
for
 
maintaining
 
the
 
highest
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdentiality.
 
We
 
have
 
implemented
 
robust
 
measures
 
to
 
safeguard
 
data
 
security
 
and
 
privacy
 
across
 
our
 
digital
 
tools
 
and
 
platforms,
 
including
 
encryption
 
of
 
survey
 
forms
 
and
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
for
 
enumerators
 
on
 
data
 
sharing,
 
accompanied
 
by
 
conﬁdentiality
 
contracts.
 
Our
 
enumerators
 
undergo
 
comprehensive
 
training
 
to
 
remain
 
unbiased
 
and
 
refrain
 
from
 
sharing
 
any
 
personal
 
opinions,
 
claims,
 
or
 
identifying
 
information.
 
They
 
are
 
bound
 
by
 
a
 
conﬁdentiality
 
agreement
 
with
 
CMS,
 
committing
 
to
 
the
 
proper
 
use
 
of
 
conﬁdential
 
information
 
solely
 
for
 
the
 
designated
 
purposes
 
outlined
 
in
 
their
 
training,
 
and
 
not
 
disclosing
 
it
 
to
 
any
 
third
 
party.
 
Additionally,
 
our
 
enumerators
 
are
 
instructed
 
not
 
to
 
copy,
 
retain,
 
or
 
share
 
any
 
written
 
information
 
that
 
could
 
potentially
 
reveal
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
individuals,
 
and
 
all
 
conﬁdential
 
information,
 
such
 
as
 
questionnaires,
 
notes,
 
photographs,
 
and
 
memoranda,
 
is
 
handed
 
over
 
to
 
the

upon
 
the
 
conclusion
 
of
 
the

Quality
 
Control
 
Mechanism
 
With
 
over
 
200
 
projects
 
and
 
an
 
in-house
 
portfolio
 
for
 
data
 
collection,
 
CMS
 
has
 
strong
 
expertise
 
in
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
This
 
becomes
 
especially
 
relevant
 
in
 
the
 
post
 
pandemic
 
scenario
 
wherein
 
the
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
following
 
stringent
 
guidelines
 
around
 
safety
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
following
 
international
 
standards.
 
 
After
 
the
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
ﬁnalised
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
JK
 
Cement
 
,
 
researchers
 
from
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
will
 
conduct
 
a
 
pilot
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
well
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
location,
 
project
 
context
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
cultural
 
point
 
of

completed,
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
scripted
 
and
 
tested
 
in-house
 
(for
 
skips
 
and
 
validations)
 
by
 
researchers
 
and
 
tested
 
in
 
a
 
setting
 
similar
 
to
 
that
 
of
 
the
 
intended
 
sample.
 
Th
e
 
ﬁnal
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
translated
 
into
 
local
 
language
 
by
 
experienced
 
thematic
 
translators
 
to
 
retain
 
the
 
essence
 
and
 
yet
 
contextualise
 
for
 
the
 
local
 
language.
 
Translated
 
tools
 
undergo
 
a
 
proofreading
 
exercise
 
to
 
check
 
the
 
consistency
 
and
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
translation
 
by
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
who
 
is
 
well
 
versed
 
in
 
local
 
languages.
 
Monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Poor
 
quality
 
data
 
reduces
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
policy
 
intervention,
 
and
 
can
 
also
 
require
 
a
 
repeat
 
of
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring
 
enumerator
 
quality
 
controls
 
with
 
spot
 
checks,
 
back
 
checks
 
(on
 
major
 
topics,
 
time
 
taken,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
looping
 
mechanisms.
 
 
Data
 
management
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
yet
 
often
 
overlooked
 
aspect
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
JK
 
Cement
 
FOUNDATION
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
has
 
strong
 
experience
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
multiple
 
scripting
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Survey
 
CTO,
 
Commcare,
 
ODK,
 
etc.
 
and
 
experience
 
in
 
online
 
data
 
management.
 
Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
data
 
cleaning.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
validation
 
exercise
 
is
 
completed
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
post-cleaning
 
efforts
 
including
 
id
 
variable
 
checking,
 
outlier
 
tagging,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
replacements,
 
illogical
 
value
 
assessment,
 
addressing
 
typos,
 
survey
 
codes,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
adding
 
labels.
 
Irregularities
 
and
 
corrections
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
documented,
 
but
 
changes
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
after
 
introspection
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
insights.

Conclusions &amp; Recommendations 
Conclusion:- 
● Challenges in Governance, M&amp;E, and Impact Enhancement: Decentralized demand generation and the dynamic implementation 
model of JKC CSR pose challenges in governance, monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), and enhancing impact. 
● Framework and Planning: There's a need for a results framework, Theory of Change, and action plan that consider community 
needs and integrate community development initiatives. This should include integrating GP data, PHC data, and the Adarsh 
Gram Panchayat Yojana with local community needs assessment. 
Recommendations:- 
● Emphasis on Supply Side Efforts: Development initiatives should emphasize efforts on the supply side, focusing on catalyzing 
ﬁnance, markets, advocacy, and governance. 
● Stakeholder Governance Mechanism: Establish a stakeholder governance mechanism to consistently address needs, plan 
activities, and allocate budgets and resources. This mechanism should align with both political and apolitical stakeholders. 
● Integrated Community Development Index: Create an Integrated Community Development Index aligned with the Adarsh Gram 
Panchayat Development Model and GPDP . 
● Pilot Program and Action Plan: Initiate a pilot program and formulate a 3 to 5-year action plan with deﬁned priorities, targets, and 
thematic areas.

When the outbreak of lumpy disease hit Nimbahera, JK 
Trusts sprang into action. Led by Gopals and a team of cattle 
experts, they swiftly organized a vaccination drive, starting 
from the affected village and extending to neighboring 
areas. This proactive approach effectively contained the 
spread of the disease, ensuring the safety of all cattle in the 
region. Additionally, the cattle experts provided necessary 
diagnosis and care to any affected animals, mitigating 
further risks.

● 47% of beneﬁciaries acknowledge JK's health interventions as contributing 
to community health enhancement. 
● The intervention's emphasis on disease treatment appears misaligned with 
community needs. 
● The community perceives that the health interventions provided are 
inadequate for comprehensive healthcare. 
● The Community Health Committee (CHC) recommends a shift towards 
prioritizing prenatal care for women and addressing elderly health concerns 
in the interventions. 
“The prevalence of anemia is not uniform across the 
region, but it is particularly common among women. 
However, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on 
prenatal care. T o address underlying issues effectively, it 
is imperative to prioritize substantial attention to 
prenatal care. ” 
-Mansoor Ali, CHC Manager 


● 52% ﬁnd JK Cement's educational resources easily accessible, 44% face limited 
access. 
● Uneven distribution blamed on focus on infrastructure. 
● Despite efforts, essentials like books, water, uniforms unevenly distributed. 
● Disparity leads to limited access. 
● Qualitative interviews conﬁrm barriers. The sports stadium being only in Mangrol 
acts as a geographical obstacle. ● 73% rate JK Cement's school infrastructure as good quality. 
● Qualitative data show positive impact on community 
perception of education. 
● Study lacks correlation between infrastructure changes and 
outcomes like enrollment. 
● Suggestion: Longitudinal studies to explore correlations. 


● Water scarcity persists despite piped water efforts. 
● Some villages still face intermittent shortages despite overall satisfaction  
with JK Cement's interventions. 
● Karunda's pond is used for cattle due to water quality concerns. 
● A tank serves many households but has limited water availability. 
● Saand and Payri villages face scarcity, resorting to motor machines and tanker  
supply. 
● Recent pipeline installation improved drinking water access, but it's exclusive. 
● Agricultural water supply in Karunda is hindered by mining operations  
acquiring wells.

Our background  
CMS was established in 1995, registered in India under the Companies Act, 1956. It is a part of 
Catalyst Group, a leading development support group in India. CMS has more than 24 years of 
experience of supporting development organizations in India and South/Southe ast Asia and 
Africa. It works with the vision of improving the quality of life of disadvantaged groups through 
strengthening effectiveness of development policies, processes and outcomes. Towards this, 
CMS supports various development partners in:  
 
1. Designing for impact - We use established design and planning frameworks, like Results 
Based Management (RBM), Logical Framework Approach among others for helping 
design theory of change, strategic plan, operational implementation plan, business plan 
among  others  
2. Research and evaluate for change - We partner with for -impact organisations and donors 
to design and execute use -focused evaluations and research using rigorous and fit -for-
purpose methodologies.  
3. Monitor for results - We believe in use -focused moni toring systems which help in moving 
up the evidence -to-results chain, with our proprietary approach PALP (Planning, 
Accountability, Learning, Performance Management), which helps partners feed 
monitoring into:  
a. Planning (and redesigning, including strategy analysis)  
b. Accountability (to communities, staff and donors)  
c. Learning (from successes, failures and the big grey middle)  
d. Performance Management [to understand trajectories, predict the future (not just 
tell the past), and diagnose)  
 
CMS has grown manifold a nd has handled more than 1100 assignments in various domains with 
200+ organizations across 29 countries.  CMS are specialists in the development sector and have 
worked across multiple themes including worker wellbeing in factory settings, WaSH, health, 
supply chain interventions among others.   
Our experience  
CMS along with its sister organization, Swasti has worked extensively with factories across the 
world. The work includes training of the workers on health and wellbeing including WaSH.  
Through these programmes, we have directly reached close to 200,000 workers, and about 
500,000 people through our community interventions across 11 countries and about 14 states in 
India.  The partners include Gap Inc. (P.A.C.E. - Personal Advancement and Career 
Enhance ment), Walmart Foundation (Women in Factories), BSR (Business for Social 
Responsibility) for HERfinance, HERhealth, HERrespect programs, Debenhams, Zlabels (LIFE), 
Page Industries (Life Skill Initiative), Primark (My Life), Levi’s and other brands for Work er 
Wellbeing initiatives.

Some of the recent experiences of CMS in similar studies has been summarized below:  
1. Establishing and running the monitoring and evaluation systems which includes 
measuring ROI and SROI at regular intervals in factories implementin g comprehensive 
health programme called Invest For Wellness (i4We)  
2. Measuring ROI in factories implementing the HerHealth programme in India  
3. Scoping study for programme with Inditex  
4. Designing and implementing a Return on Investment tool for garment factorie s 
implementing life skill initiatives  
5. Situation assessment of access to health services and indirect reach of the HERhealth 
program  
6. Study Worker Satisfaction in high performing vendor factories of Migros  
7. Monitoring and evaluation of BMGF funded Avahan Indi a AIDS Initiative across five 
states in India for 3.5 years  
8. Assessments in over 100 healthcare facilities in 3 states of the country in partnership 
with WaterAid to monitor the Water, Sanitation and hygiene conditions  
9. Evaluation of WaSH interventions in ur ban slums in India  
10. GAIN Unilever Project: Evaluation of the Nutrition Program with Tea farmers, farm 
workers and estate workers in Tamil Nadu, India focussed on improving the dietary 
diversity and handwashing habits of the tea farming families  
11. Consultation  Service to Develop Training Manual with Modules for the Capacity Building 
of Village Water and Sanitation Committees under NRDWP  
12. Process documentation of Atmashakti's approach to achieving sanitation in rural Odisha  
13. Evaluation of Arghyam’s interventions i n WaSH in India  
 
Hence, we bring together thematic experience of working in factories and in health and WaSH  
and the technical expertise of monitoring and evaluation, research, data collection and 
conducting ROI and SROI studies in different settings.  
Our approach  
CMS will bring together a team with experience of working with factories, of designing 
monitoring and evaluation systems, implementing it, designing research and collecting data and 
of designing and implementing ROI studies in different settings. We understand that an 
approach for ROI and evaluation has been finalized already and the finalized team nee ds to 
implement the approach and monitor it regularly to measure and report the progress.  
 
As detailed in the RFP, CMS will depute a consultant from the team who will be based out of 
Lucknow and will support through inhouse support for atleast 1 day in th e week. In addition to 
this, we also will bring experts who will provide technical and managerial support to the 
consultant for designing tools and implementing them for monitoring of the programme, 
measuring ROI and writing reports and case studies which can be used for larger dissemination.

The image below summarizes the approach which CMS would like to adopt for supporting 
WaterAID and the factories for this assignment.  
 
 
 
As explained in the framework, the following are the key processes that will be undertaken to 
ensure that the deliverables are met with comprehensiveness and quality.  
1. Designing of theory of change and the impact pathway for the interventions  
We start with a premise that currently a detailed theory of change does not exist for the  
programme. Hence, a consultation will be done with the key stakeholders in the programme 
including the factory staff, WaterAid Bangladesh and WaterAid India staff, WaSH experts and 
other supply chain players to design the impact pathways. This will includ e pathways for the 
workers, the factory and the supply chain players. Based on this workshop, the team will draft a 
Theory of Change, which will be circulated to key experts for feedback. The TOC will be finalized

based on feedback from them. This will be used to understand progress, design monitoring and 
evaluation framework and processes, analyse achievements and design the tools for field survey.  
2. Field research in household and factory settings  
We propose mixed methods design for this evaluation. The st udy will be sequential with 
qualitative data collection preceding quantitative data collection. The study will employ 
difference in difference technique with data collection being done at baseline and endline after 
the programme has ended.  It is currently  assumed that baseline for the programme is not done 
and we will use recall method for creating the baseline.  
 
We propose the following calculations for ensuring that the outcomes and impact is measured 
and feeds back into the ROI calculations. However, t hese can be revised based on discussions 
with the consultants in India and Bangladesh.   
 
Power calculation for sampling will be done at the programme level. Unit of sampling for this 
evaluation will be workers who are exposed to the intervention in the fa ctory and in their 
household. The following are the assumptions for calculating the sample for quantitative data 
collection:  
1. Confidence interval - 95%  
2. Error margin - 5% 
3. Dropout rate - 50%  
4. Design effect - 1.2 
 
Assuming a total of 3,000 workers across the three factories, the sample size is 620. The workers 
will be selected proportionately from each of the factories based on their population.   
 
For qualitative data collection, we propose to conduct group interviews in each of the factories 
of 10 to 15 workers each. In addition to this, in depth discussions will be done with the factory 
staff including senior management and clinic staff to understand the areas of enquiry and the 
outcomes and impact experien ced by the factories. This will also include collecting data from the 
factories on key indicators like:  
a. Attendance of workers  
b. Retention of workers  
c. Productivity of workers  
d. Reduced expenditure on health for the factories  
e. Increased repeat orders through impro ved brand image  
f. Reduced rejections  
g. Reduced reduction in expenditure for the workers and their families on health  
h. Sustainability of these interventions  
i. Access and usage of the WaSH facilities  
j. Behavior change among the workers  
 

 
7 
 
This process will be followed by in depth interviews with some of key supply chain players to 
understand the outcomes and impact experienced by them due to the interventions.  
 
External field investigators will be employed with experience of conducting similar studies in 
Uttar Pradesh and in factories. Quality assurance will be done by experts as supervisors who will 
also be involved in conducting interviews with the senior team.  
 
This data will be analyzed to measure the outputs, outcome and impact of the programme and 
ROI for the fac tories and the supply chain.  
3. Continuous monitoring of ROI in collaboration with the factories  
Based on the theory of change as designed after consultation with the key stakeholders,  CMS 
will design a simple macro enabled excel tool which captures the imp act pathway starting from 
inputs at the programme level and in the factories to the key monitorable outputs at the factory 
tool.  
 
This tool will be administered by the CMS consultant in each of the factories every 6 months to 
measure the trend in progress  of the interventions, progress of the outputs and hence the 
preliminary ROI. This will be supplemented with data from the evaluations at the worker and the 
household level which will provide additional outcomes and measures for ROI.

1. Data collection at baseline and endline will be done by CMS  
2. Local and national travel of the team members, including the consultant based out of 
Lucknow will be borne by CMS. International travel and its associated costs will be borne 
by WaterAid  
3. The budget is for the period till April 2021  
4. The cost of the national and state consultations will be supported by WaterAid
