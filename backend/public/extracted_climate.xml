The
 
Council
 
on
 
Energy,
 
Environment
 
and
 
Water
 
is
 
currently
 
conducting
 
an
 
Impact
 
Assessment
 
Study
 
and
 
detailed
 
perception
 
survey
 
amongst
 
the
 
donor
 
community
 
—
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
stakeholder
 
groups
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
—
 
to
 
understand
 
its
 
growth,
 
impact,
 
risks
 
and
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
from
 
their
 
perspective.
 
In
 
this
 
regard,
 
we
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
understand
 
your
 
opinions
 
on
 
the
 
above
 
topic.
 
Over
 
90%
 
of

funding
 
being

from
 
third-party
 
grants,
 
dependent
 
upon
 
agreed
 
project
 
deliverables
 
and
 
cascading
 
policy
 
impact
 
the
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
donor
 
and
 
grant
 
making
 
community
 
becomes
 
a
 
critical
 
pathway
 
to
 
measure,
 
understand
 
and
 
improve
 
going
 
forward.
 
We
 
are
 
focussing
 
on
 
the
 
following
 
criteria
 
as
 
the
 
guidance
 
for
 
the
 
study.
 
1.
 
Understanding
 
Impact:
 
Mapping
 
The
 
Council's
 
research,
 
advisory
 
and
 
outreach
 
—
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
had
 
(from
 
outputs
 
to
 
outcomes)
 
with
 
exciting
 
visuals
 
and
 
testimonials.
 
2.
 
Understanding
 
Growth:
 
Analysing
 
perceptions
 
around
 
The
 
Council’s
 
growth
 
being
 
organic,
 
planned
 
or
 
strategic;
 
areas
 
where
 
we
 
have
 
surpassed
 
expectations
 
and
 
where
 
potential
 
remains
 
not
 
fully
 
realised.
 
3.
 
Understanding
 
Visibility:
 
Analysing
 
The
 
Council’s
 
approach
 
towards
 
data
 
and
 
strategic
 
outreach,
 
its
 
commitment
 
to
 
transparency
 
and
 
its
 
position
 
in
 
the
 
public
 
mindset.
 
4.
 
Understanding
 
Risks:
 
Analysing
 
how
 
donors
 
perceive
 
The
 
Council’s
 
governance
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
risks
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
must
 
be
 
resilient
 
against,
 
whether
 
emanating
 
from
 
internal
 
processes,
 
external
 
environment
 
or
 
strategic
 
directions.
 
5.
 
Understanding
 
Demand:
 
Assessing
 
what
 
donors
 
want
 
and
 
ﬁnding
 
points
 
of
 
synergy
 
and
 
alignment
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
approaches
 
without
 
compromising
 
on
 
The
 
Council’s
 
well-earned
 
independence
 
6.
 
Understanding
 
our
 
value-proposition:
 
Assessing
 
perceptions
 
on
 
The
 
Council’s
 
values
 
and
 
priorities,
 
including
 
being
 
integrated
 
in
 
analysis,
 
international/global
 
in
 
outlook,
 
independent
 
of
 
funders
 
and
 
clients,
 
and
 
its
 
commitment
 
to
 
building
 
careers
 
in
 
public
 
policy.
 
7.
 
Benchmarking
 
The
 
Council
 
against
 
domestic
 
and
 
international
 
competition.

Objectives of the study
The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) aims to commission 
a perception survey among the donor community —a key stakeholder for 
The Council —to understand its growth, impact, risks and vision for the 
future from their perspective.
1. Understanding Impact: Mapping CEEW's research, advisory and outreach —and the impact 
CEEW has had (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials.
2. Understanding Growth: Analysing perceptions around CEEW’s growth being organic, 
planned or strategic; areas where we have surpassed expectations and where potential 
remains not fully realised.
3. Understanding Visibility: Analysing CEEW’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, 
its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset.
4. Understanding Risks: Analysing how donors perceive CEEW’s governance as well as the 
risks that CEEW must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, 
external environment or strategic directions.
5. Understanding Demand: Assessing what donors want and finding points of synergy between 
the two approaches without compromising on CEEW’s well -earned independence
6. Understanding our value -proposition: Assessing perceptions on CEEW’s values and 
priorities, including being integrated in analysis, international/global in outlook, independent 
of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy.
7. Benchmarking CEEW against domestic and international competition.

Bloomberg	New	1) There is a need for collabaration

2) CEEW can do both inside and outside strategy	1) Bloomberg works with a lean team, Puja is the only person in India. They don't invest in infra etc. Grantmaking etc is handled by only Puja.
 
2) Post FCRA they had to become more direct grantees, Bloomberg prefers to have less paperwork. Earlier Shakti used to re-grant. 

3) In terms of CEEW no issues at this point, systems are already set up. 

4) No robust evaluation criteria for grantees, informal process but now it is slightly more streamlined where grantees come up with their own metrics. We only look at contribution. 	1) Need integrated, organisation reporting, grantee and donor should be more in sync

	1) Employees are treated well, Arunabha shows good leadership skills, gives space for this team and leaders to grow.
 
2) Need Clarity on organisation development

3) Young employee base is a strength but needs to expand more
	1) CEEW are queued in the international conversation  as well as on the national need	1) CEEW has potential in technology but needs to build its capacity	1) CEEW has a holistic approach- independent, advocacy, policy making connect

2) Great connect with Policy makes, Arunabhas ability to influence. Policy advocacy is key.

3) CEEW align with the independent, integrated and international and is very dynamic
	AQ remained the key, now Bloomberg is moving towards net zero etc post COP 26
Hewlett	Retained	1) Convening capacities are difficult to judge	1) Outreach is good, channels of communication employed is effective. Visual communication is good. 	1) Grown in size, doubled in terms of number of people

2) Lack of clarity for people in the org, in terms of focussing on specific areas of work. Stemming from lack of clear positioning

3) As the size of the team grew, leadership was needed and this did not happen and there is a lack of clarity on who are the leaders etc. This led to lack of clear alignment between teams

4) People are key to this space and CEEW made them consultants than researchers. Role clarity within the org is crucial.

5) Building capacities and groom leaders	1) Independence from Govt is not something seen	1) No clear positioning on what they want to do in India ( policy issues,on Energy/Climate) in terms of strategic priorities

2) Focus seems much more on whatever is interesting rather than a consistent follow up on a particular area of work in terms of outcomes, impact (Policy changes) - Hydrogen is an example. Most work not coming from thought out way for working. 

3) What Indian government wants to do is the priority rather than what CEEW wants to do, as a result their capacities is getting stretched. More of a bandwagon approach rather than strategic. 

	1) Do not see the fit in terms of technology overall, Staff seem interested but do not consider them deep experts	1) Finance work they have done is good, overall the work they do is of good quality. 

2) Building basic capacities in the last 10 years is commendable

3) Among the top civil society players in India

4) Arunabha and top leaders are good	1) Work on electric mobility has been spotty, not necessarily their fault. 

2) Lack of clarity on where they want to go, work is good but no direction is an issue. 

3) Clearly articulated agenda	Knows CEEW prior to the engagement with Hewlett, seems to know few ppl in CEEW specifically as well. Hence insights were more from that rather than the engagment in specific with Hewlett. 
IISD	Retianed	1. CEEW has a strong central level relationships. Key target of IISD is G20 and CEEW have high level contact
2. At the state level it is hard to comment on and don't have a good sense of it. 
	1. IISD works only on specific topics and so far the collaboration with CEEW is around these topics. IISD is currently specializing in the fossil fuel and clean energy space. 
2. Main reason to select CEEW was based on the previous engagament. They felt confident to work them again
3. CEEW had technical capacity and were also a quick learner
4. Once IISD likes working with an org, they most likely end up working together on different projects.
	1. Require writing and research focused
2.  Expectation from think tanks: Strong data/research skill, meticulously keep track of complex range of source, doing critical thinking of the data collected, good writers, coherent well structure accurate precise writing 
3. IISD relationships with policy makers are fairly limited so it's important for the partners/grantees of IISD to have those relationships and have a proactive approach to those opportunities and connect to policy decisions and forums. 
	1. Communication is tough with CEEW, 
2.There is lot of back and forth to get feeback from CEEW on the advocay products. They don't follow the structure (insert comments and lack of constructive comment, too many people commenting on a single draft)
3 CEEW is the hardest working think tank in comms space but there is some culture issue with CEEW on comms 

4. Work on solar pumps with CEEW- 
CEEW produced Interactive data point but there is a lot more can be done to sharpen up such as on usability, could have used more effort on data platform in terms of design. 
However the final product is good but the process and points of communication, ctions to deliver the products are not so smooth while working with CEEW. 

5.Comms team of CEEW are not deeply aware of the content in terms of raising comments on IISD comms products. It becomes challenging as it feels disconnected from everything that IISD has already written in it. There is quite a mismatch 
	1. CEEW is hierarchical 
Senior people like Karthik comments are well justified and on point
Limitation: Delay in recieving comments from senior people. Perception is that they are stretched in other things and burdened with work and hence becomes challenging to receive inputs 
2, Effectivess between comms teams &amp; project team could be improved: they donot get  involved in the project from the begining and hence dont know the exact context. This creates a misalignment between the comm and project team.  
	1. Within the FCRA constraints CEEW does a good job of being independent, they have become bolder in talking on topics related to NET zero phase out of coal/fossil fuel.
2. Impressive to see CEEW become more bolder on these topics in the near future. 
3. As a leading voice in India CEEW has an opportunity to make a difference. There are real concerns around just transition, social responsibility, these are area of opportunity where CEEW can voice their opinion within the constraints they have. 
	1.CEEW work is strong on finance. IISD sees CEEW as a great partner to have expertise on investment. 
But not familiar with piloting technologies 
	1. Impressed with CEEW analytical work and writing work 
2. Great contributionon Design phase
3. Strong on influencing phase
	1.CEEW is bit territorial when it comes to sharing contacts and creating conversation with policy influencers  
2. IISD has tried to engage with CEEW to approach donors together and never received a positive response from CEEW. IISD thinks about CEEW as a partner but the same is not conveyed from CEEW end. The flow of fund is unilateral 

SSEF	Retained	1. Resistance to collaborate with different partners which could be competitive 
2. Reluctant to engage and collaborate with Competitors 
	SSEF percives there are various ways to rank a TT- there is not a one tangible one 
1. Quantitative indicator - this includes Cost and policy outcomes or number to studies generated and how does it commensurate with the funding, how many studies lead to policy outcomes (not easy to measure)
2. Qualitative indicator -  TT is supposed to give thought leadership to Decision makers, how the ideas have found uptake of decision makers, led to debate in civil society. Uptake among decision makers, Diverse set of stakeholders to develop consensus 
4. For long term problem CEEW need some core funding somewhere 
5. Shakti is not a pure donar, but believes in institutional funding, does give core funding but on a small scale. 	Enagagement indicator during the course of fudning 
1. For funding Shakti looks for quality of work, for commissioning of work Shakti looks for objectives which are clearly articulated,  subject is of importance of policy, analytical rigor, uptake of work. 
2. Project team are Satisfied with CEEW overall work, they report on time, delivery on time. Only the depth is lacking in some cases. 
3. If the shortcoming is worked upon and leaderships addresses that is important to conitnue engagement
4. Awards and ranking of TT in global index does not matter to Shakti as a funder, The institution who are ranked high don't need to project through the ranking index, CEEW is a good insutitin and they donot need a index to project.  	1. Ability to hold convenings with big players such as govt, industry
2. Lack of depth or content in the reports published by the CEEW, 
3. Lack of depth in the analysis could  be due to the desire to expand rapidly and be heard in the sector

	1. Arunbha is very assertive and strong leader, knowledgeable- This has worked well for organization  
2. Arunabha has led to rapid growth of CEEW and is able to Understand the political context, diplomacy part 
3. Risk- However with this style of leadership- This could lead to people not speaking their mind (speculation)
4. Arunabha focus is more on the his institution rather than what is important for larger audience, Projection of the institution (CEEW) comes out more strongly from the leader rather than on the problem at hand 
5. Next line of leadership were not upto the desired level of knowledge: Gulf between Arunabha and the next line of leadership. Important for Arunabha to groom the next line of leadership 
6. Strong internal quality check is important and CEEW has good quality of expert but lack depth 	1. Ranking of the think tank is not important from Shakti's perspective and think tank (CEEW) need not project it. 
	1. CEEW is delhi centric but they have presence in states and Shakti is working with CEEW in Bihar 

2. CEEW will be getting demand from various states whicl will be good as they will get to expand 
	1. On the technology front they need to develop deeper strengths. Arunabha has great strengths on political context, international diplomacy, however on technology if CEEW wants to contribute , they need to build more depth and strengthen this. 
2. Over projection and claiming credit is CEEW weakness for eg: a) conceptualizing the thought process of IAS, b) Net zero debate	1. Arunabha has good leadership skills: Committed, subject expertise, skills and hard working. His knowledge, integrity and his skills are well established 
2. CEEW ability to convene stakeholders (govt, industry) and curation of the convening and outcome is good. 
3. Ambition is high and has propelled them to become a large institution in a short period of time. Impoprtant contributions made by young group of researchers. 
4. They have also made important contributions to policy and generated discussion in the country, evidence based knowledge surrounding COP 
	1. CEEW reports lack depthness in their content. This could be due to the desire to expand rapidly and show quick results and be heard in the sector
2. Reluctantancy/Resistance towards Development of consortium from CEEW 
3. Strong desire of self projection and hogging the limelight often
4. Sometime its portrayed that Institution development is more important than policy problems they are trying to solve. 

SHELL	1. CEEW has good connects in govt, however in terms of  investors, the connections were not strong initially but later came out to be impressive with investor engagement in powering livelihood and has done well. 
2. Overall CEEW is more stronger in policy maker engagement than investor engagement front 
	1. Administrative 
CEEW takes more time to sign agreement, there legal is strong but the process are repetitive , if they are partnering with the same org again the process need not start from scratch , some level of improvement needed on the administrative side 

2. factors for Sustain funding 
a) Action coming out of the work that is done-CEEW is good in doing this, this means they build good relations with the ecosystem. They do better in areas like advocacy and action delivery. 
b) CEEW can do better in People side
c) Alignment with the strategy- Gender inclusion is important for SHELL and CEEW needs to step up with having a Coherent organization wide strategy and to have a clear top down strategy on Gender inclusion not just having a few people who are passionate to work on this. 

3) Funding of the Shell is based on the milestones. These are linked to the actions coming out. 


Institutions and untied funds 
a) SHELL won’t change the strategy and primarily fund for profit enterprises and do core funding in that space.
b) SHELL  goal is create evidence so that social enterprises can scale and get more leverage and create impact and influence funders and investors 
c) Larger scale donors might be better place to look at institutional capacity building like of CEEW 
d) Didn’t see Institutional capacity was a challenge for CEEW 
	1. Have fortnightly calls with CEEW on powering livelihood, CEEW is open and quite flexible with different donors on their needs. They are open to quicker discussion 
2. They are flexible to donors, overall engagement strategy is good
3. They are proactive and take into account stakeholder perspective and adjust their own strategy

4. Awards and ranking are not important when it comes to engaging with Think tanks
5. For Donors the most important thing is people- team capability, this create lot of perception among donors
	1. CEEW has Scaled their quality in terms of the output produced, Done well with publication such as newspaper publication 
2. Social media strategy could be improved as lot of people consume content through media and not report 
3. CEEW Started comic on Climate which was innovative 
4. They come out with good content but works more on producing short stories, briefly like blogs, snippets on social media that can attract people. 
5. CEEW is ahead of the other think tanks in terms of communication but have the capacity to do more in terms of social media and communications strategy- Globally they can improve, locally they are good in communication. 
6. CEEW can draw ideas from other peers in terms of communication and engagement internationally
	1. CEEW is stretched with resources. Their team was overlapping with the two different proposals/projects - these get noticed by other donors as well.
2. Succession planning can be improved
3. Attrition was a challenge:  Affects the continuity of the programme
4. They can have better resource planning and doing less but big things and think about scaling their team based on the number of outputs produced. To maintain their cost effectiveness they could look into reducing the number of things/deliverables currently engaged on. 
	1. They brings credibility and do Peer reviews and quality check-and their process if quite robust which brings credibility 
2. Might need to improve their retention strategies and come up ways to retain good talent 
3. CEEW is key to these partnerships given their connection levels with key stakeholder and credibility in the ecosystem- this is the reason for success of the programme

Independence: They take in account donor's expectation and modifies their strategy but at the same time they do not compromise the real finding in the sectors and not what donor what to see. 

Integration across all sector (livelihood, economy, people)
Integration is important, and this should stay as a core part of their work. Powering livelihood had a holistic strategy and wasn’t focused on just a single sector and this attracted SHELL to work with CEEW. 
Donors work in silos and CEEW is placed well to bridge that gap between donors and their different priority 	1. Global-  Expanding to look at other geographies - This might not be best suited to CEEW, they need to first invest in resources in order to execute/operate this. They can look partnering with other org as a knowledge transfer to increase and expand their brand globally but perceive that CEEW is not yet globally to start implementation. They can represent India internationally. 
2. National- They are better placed locally/Nationally and having a strong presence Pan India will attract global funders who are interested in India as a market, as India is a key market in CLimate both from Adaptation and mitigation sector. So CEEW is well positioned and can be the front runner in this space. CEEW has good linkages with stake level bodies in the energy sector. 
3. Sector focus- They are working in most sector and have good experience 
They can represent India rather than operating internationally 

	1. CEEW market perception mostly in the energy sector is quite good and  specially engagement with govt agencies. It is known that it's not easy to work at speed when working in policy think tank space.
2. CEEW were action oriented and were well perceived in the policy space- there were high chances of message reaching the right stakeholders: 
3. Strong networking and connections with the stakeholders (govt)


Norwegian Embassy	Retained	1. CEEW can influence legislation, government etc Food for thought for authorities. 
2. Ranked their Social capital and networking as high, technical knowledge is also very high 
3. Their staff are part of committees of GOI
	1. Lack of business model and fundraising team in CEEW : Perception 
2. Domain experts should be able to convince the donor.
3. Activity that created an impact in sector and presence of results framework and try to follow as much as possible - Impact- outcomes (medium)- tangible outputs- activities , and Norwegian stress upon the RF as part of project document. 
4. Grant management division look for some cross cutting issue in Project document and project activity will not have any
a)  adverse impact on environment and
b) promote gender equality,
c) zero tolerance to corruption,
d) not adverse impact wrt to human right,
4. Knowledge products and academic outcomes are important to look at in a project document. Norway lays quite value to it. 
If there is converge with what NE wants to do and CEEW activities then would like to do further engagement 
5. NE budget does not cover untied funds	1. Have been engaging with CEEW last 5-6 years. Working on the HFC project for the last 2-3 years
2. Credibility, capacity and competence matter a lot
3.The org should be established one and not to be involved in any controversy 
4. Norwegian also carry out mid and end term and this exercise will help to evaluate if the project achieved was was meant to- M&amp;E 
5. Norwegian Also look for how a TT were able to influence policy, govt- 
6. CEEW has good performance in social, capital, networking and technical (domain experts) as well. 

	1. CEEW is Dissemination has been good, their website has lot of knowledge products and are doing a good job
2. Fairly good at disseminating information and public 
3. No aware of their comm strategy but otherwise CEEW is good at presenting their finding and have utilized their website for advocating and publicizing their outputs 
	1. Being young is their strength, young team members come up with fresh ideas ad innovative ideas and are energetic
2. Many employees are also part of govt committee and state level authoritie.  
3. Certain member of CEEW can be considered as second line of leader in terms of networking with the govt and other agency and its not AG driven only 
	1. Independence: CEEW works quite a lot independently and have noticed that not all CEEW activities are funding driven. They conceptualize the idea first and then look at the funding side. 
2. Norwegian have given flexibility to grantees on the research work done but donot try to influence much . Associating with CEEW have been independent so far, reported what were the finding
	1. On technology they have published paper such as on technology availability and what can be introduced 
2. CEEW is not specifically in technology development. 
3. Don't see them as part of tech at this moment.  
4. Facilitating a tech transition is something they are not into according to vivek, . Phase 2 has tech + policy	1. CEEW is young, young team members come up with fresh ideas ad innovative ideas and are energetic 
2. Well recognized and this lead to distinction of CEEW as lead org of energy and environment . 
3. Arunabha is very good at networking as well as other members of CEEW
4. Overall Norwegian had a good experience of working with CEEW and find them as a good partner 
IKEA Foundation	New	1. CEEW have good inroad with policy circle (govt) and their research, report and data are credible and is widely accepted within govt and other stakeholder
2. Incubation space- CEEW don't have strength in this particular area and hence they have collaborated with like minded org like Villgro and trying to build inroads with the incubation ecosystem in India as well . Such as in Powering Livelihood, CEEW is trying to build a network with incubation space and banking sector. 
 
	1. IKEA scouts for aligned partnership or aligned project which matches the objectives of the foundation
2. IKEA looks for in the partners (parameters)
a) Long term partnership and 
b) put lot of value in terms of simplicity , transparency and openness, 
c) value add to the end client. 
d) Kind of leaderships and kind of team engaged in the programme 

3. IKEA supports the Non profit in the process of their institutional development and IKEA looks at overhead cost 
4. Looks for outcome, Impacts in grant proposal- Impact assessment. IKEA user focused and looks for results that are being achieved at customer end for whom the programme is targeted at.
5. CEEW ability to do advocacy with stakeholder/policy maker,  govt and with other non profit players as well, they have neutral stand on the data they collect (additional credibility)
6. IKEA doesn't look into the awards Integrated, independence	1. Partnership with CEEW past couple of years: CEEW programme aligned with IKEA portfolio of grant making objective

2. CEEW goes beyond the contract agreement, CEEW is proactive in engagement with IKEA, engagement in advisory support groups, share learnings and organise convenings sessions around the learnings produced. IKEA looks more into the value proposition of the think tank not the market strategy, members working on ground is more important than virtual market/partnership engagement. 
3. CEEW builds the value proposition and reaches out, finds the synergies with the donor, this provides an encouraging environment to work and engage, this brings value for engagement. CEEW is transparent about the strengths and limitations they have, reports and data are credible so accepted with stakeholders, 
3.  Impressed by the structure of CEEW and the value they offer, their track record was strong and appreciated what CEEW was able to achieve in small time span and established itself as a leading thought leader while being very cost efficient. 	1. CEEW can do a lot more in terms of covenings front and knowledge sharing, play an anchor role 
2. CEEW has done some good work around COP 26 and advocacy around that. CEEW should function as the convener of the knowledge product or the insights they gather from different programme. 
	1.High degree of decentralization and empowerment within the employees
2. Second line of leaderships are empowered to talk about their progress. 
3. In terms of succession planning and scaling and maintaining quality, CEEW needs to be conscious of who they want to plan their model of succession in terms of centralization and decentralization. 
4. It will be good if CEEW stick to decentralization in terms of their operation and scaling up 
	1. Good visibility in Indian ecosystem and internationally they have also started out, but they have a scope of building more as an entity
2. Linear entity as compared to other Think Tanks and have delivered quality
	1. IKEA looks more into the value proposition of the think tank not the market strategy, members working on ground is more important than virtual market/partnership engagement.
2. CEEW builds the value proposition and reaches out, finds the synergies with the donor, this provides an encouraging environment to work and engage, this brings value for engagement. 
	1. IKEA see technology as a niche space- but how tech fits into market ecosystem, player like CEEW can build insight on-they can unfold narrative in between what is available and how to scale- This is the innovation they can bring 
	Factors that would Stop Funding 

1. When org become overdependent on stream of financing or grant maker- CEEW can focus on diversifying their donor base- This helps the grantees to evolve their thinking and diverse their funding source.

2. When TT Stop ideating on their own and follow typical market charms of defining larger goals  and vision of projects which are uncoordinated which run completely on funding support. This creates a disconnect between what they want to achieve as an entity and kind of project they are rolling out- If there is a mismatch this limits the donors attraction towards the TT 

3. As donor IKEA would want the TT should have a sharper focus on the value proposition that they are building out. 

Good Energies 	Retained	1. CEEW find the solution and take it to higher level policy/decision makers
	1. GE prefers to speak with the programme staff, since good energy is more focused on the progress of the project. Main point of contact should be the project team
2. Institutional capacity building: Rarely gives undesignated untied core funding
3. Resources- grantee should have the resources and skill and talents to attract fund. 
	1. Interacted with two different teams: Overall CEEW is timely and organized and submit thing on time, they donot drown GE with information and are precise 
2. Abhishek-interact on six month basis to review of the progress 
3. Finance team- bit of a hiccup with engagement 
4. Not important to have a think tank index, it could be taken as a sign of external evaluation 
	1. CEEW has more content or publish news than noise, post things with good content rather than amount 
2. They put on a mix of research content, org info or commentary of initiative and they are doing a good work this creates a fine balance
3. Donot track no. of CEEW publication or ts scalability, but it should mirror the GE quest of change 	1. CEEW can focus on the second level of  leadership and Arunabha does most of the heavy lifting as a leader 
2. Risk- the second line of leadership even if they get recognition as a senior staff would be taking up duties and responsibilities without the title, pay and recognition of CEO which could lead to losing ambitious qualified staff. 
3. CEEW is fixated on a single leader and survival of the org is difficult. Leadership duties hence should be divided among other member as well. 	1. Huge Dependence on govt on the FCRA funds and might lead to pulling out of significant funds, hence being truly independent can be certainly challenging. 
	1. CEEW is doing a job and their work on Climate is board. They need to think where they can have the most leverage and have the most benefit and not have a program in all states.  
	1. Highly impressed with Arunabha research and leadership skills. The team in CEEW are highly action oriented,
2. Produce good content of the work, use original data and able to explain the implication of the data to policy makers and general public and engaging with policy makers on the data produced
3. They are organized and does on time submission 

 
	1, Challenges while engaging with finance team 
	1. a) GE focus on MEL framework: They measure Outcome-  is it leading to some change such as policy adopted and is being implemented
b) Tracks indicators from outcome and mostly track at an annual basis and output to track the progress (project) of the grantee. 
c) GE create impact table which defines the indicators and its outcomes with partners (co-creation)
d) This is not an exercise which decides which partner will get the next funding, it is a collective guess at where change has happened in the system and to reach the ultimate goal. 

CIFF	New	1. Political lever and leverage they are able to draw in terms of the policy space, is an attractive proposition
2. Potential to collaborate with other Think tanks, competetors is absent and still in evolving stage
3. Need to realise the importance of partnerships, acknowledged by Arunabha in a public event
4. Convening power to bring partners to ISA - which has been claimed across many forums	1. CIFF does not do core funding, it is always programmatic grant. Even when we do regrant and fund continously a think tnak, our engagement fro funds is centred around programmtic funding predominantly.
2. One of the reasons, orgs such as TERI used to have a tough adaptation strategy when they diversified their fundings etc. is something CEEW can learn from. Unlike TERI which is forced to be a lean organization. As donor community we have a dearth of global think tanks. CEEWs vision is good and they can be a global think tank. Currently we do not have think tanks working on sustainable finance, CIFF wants to do that for example. If CEEW aspires to be that, that is something that could really help the indian ecosystems.
3. Funding and evidence independance without sustainable expansion can lead to similar stagnance TERI is facing today compared to their growth and development a decoade ago. WRT to CEEW, diversification is a key pivot at this critical juncture. Moving beyond the current Delhi centric, policy think tank narrative to sub national level work is key for supporting the 10 yrs of work and deepen their impact across India and the world. The domestic funding landscape is not mature enough which is a challenge
4. CIFF as an international philanthropy wants to expand the domesting funding ecosystem by collaborating and collectively with the domestic philanthropies. 
5. CEEW needs to diversify their funding - too reliant on philanthropy - high reliance on foreign funding. 	1. Shakthi regranted to CEEW more times in the past. WRT the cooling project CEEW was one of the few who had done work in this.
2. CEEWs involvement with the drafting of the ICAP - India Cooling Action Plan, they fit right under our investments - as a think tank - specific component like R&amp;D, Trainign and CB of the servicing sector - Important lever for us to engage with CEEW
3. CIFF did not want to do multiple contracts and historically CEEW and TERI did not work together. It took a year to make everyone to work together but it was worth looking at the results. Arunabha has acknowledged the same, now CEEW is more open with working with other donors. CEEW agreeing to the same is important in continuing with them as a partner. They work on a broad range of areas but CIFF has been selective in areas. 
4. Current project engagement happens at the program level, Arunabha does not come in but for initial contracts/partnerships etc.. Our first conversation with him, he was punching above his weight, the conversation was arunabha centric, his acheivemetns and potential, very little scope for growth inside the organization. One senior peron moved last year. They need to create oppns for second round of leaders. This is something we look at as well.
5. We do not converge on the Energy and Power priorities - CEEW focus on decentralised energy access, CIFF doesnt and Agri work is nascent and not substantial for CIFF to engage with.	1. Claiming attribution in the place of contribution -  This is a generic positioning they take, they did play a role but other think tanks have a role to play. They have the convening power, so does TERI and CII. Its advisable from CEEW, they should draw a line on what they can claim and what is the larger ecosystem.	1. Second line of leadership, too much reliant on Arunabha. They had one second line person, but now they lost it and hence they need to look at it closely. 
2. CEEW has a sharp team, great analytical abilities, diversity in type of research, depth of research etc. Certainly credit to them	1. Contribution vs attribution, CEEW tries to project contribution as attribution. Example of this is the COP 26 claim when PM announced, CEEW is one of the many claimants to being the responsible for India's stance. It comes from the CEO and is trickled down to everyone there, this is something that they should be careful about. They need to realise what they can tag attribution or contribution for, after occupying 10-11 years in the space. Not all govt. work can be claimed attribution credit for. 
2. For a donor based in India think tank ratings, accreditation or certification does not matte, however for international donors and grant making agencies, rankings matter and some GMA's actively pursue it.	1. CEEW - Think tank in this sector especially, CEEW have grown very fast, in the ecosystem
2. Very few think tanks cover the breadth and width of work in climate change, CEEW is one of them. 
3. CEEW brought a fresh approach and did not have baggage unlike TERI and DA.
4. Being new was an advantage, the way they have grown as a global voice is commendable. 
5. CEEWs position is very hardlined just like govt of India, they should not been seen as invoicing govts opinion. Independent think tank should not just be a voice of the govt. Voicing India's strength and highlighting areas of improvement would be needed. Eg, Kigali Amendment - CEEW took a positiong to the same of Govt. of India despite being an Independent Think Tank.
6. Political lever and leverage they are able to draw in terms of the policy space, is an attractive proposition	1. CEEWs expertise on doing new areas of research and ability to take risks is good. 
2. The project on future of oil and gas in India is an example for this, CEEW is more flexible. Few niche areas of work as well they have their foot in
3. They work across research, MEAL etc. across cross cutting domains such as agri, power, energy efficiency, transport, finance etc. and have a good reputation for their work.	1. Hope they do realize the importance of partnerships, They need to diversify their funding source. They are too reliant on philanthropic funding, for their long term sustainability. They do not get funding from govt so to ensure independence they have to make sure their funding is diversified.
2. CEEWs position is very hardlined just like govt of India, they should not been seen as invoicing govts opinion. Independent think tank should not just be a voice of the govt. Voicing India's strength and highlighting areas of improvement would be needed
3. Even withing the existing donor cohort, CEEW engages with approaches such as, &quot;We are a leading think tank in India, in the Climate and Sustainability sector&quot;, which is of no potential use for local donors or donors who are already engaging with them. Although they have earned it for sure, their branding must be more subtle. 
4. CEEW prefers getting programmatic grants and the past engagements suggest the same. Even their long relationship with Shakthi suggests the same. 
CAF	1. Ability to go out and network the external forces in play in the sector

Purpose
 
and
 
Scope
 
of
 
the
 
Study
 
The
 
Council
 
on
 
Energy,
 
Environment
 
and
 
Water
 
(The
 
Council)
 
in
 
collaboration
 
with
 
Catalyst
 
Management
 
Services
 
Pvt.
 
Ltd.
 
(CMS)
 
has
 
commissioned
 
this
 
perception
 
survey
 
amongst
 
the
 
donor
 
community
 
—
 
a
 
key
 
stakeholder
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
—
 
to
 
understand
 
its
 
growth,
 
impact,
 
risks
 
and
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
from
 
their
 
perspective.
 
Over
 
90%
 
of
 
The
 
Council’s
 
funding
 
being
 
generated
 
from
 
third-party
 
grants,
 
dependent
 
upon
 
agreed
 
project
 
deliverables
 
and
 
cascading
 
policy
 
impact
 
the
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
donor
 
and
 
grant
 
making
 
community
 
becomes
 
a
 
critical
 
pathway
 
to
 
measure,
 
understand
 
and
 
improve
 
going
 
forward.
 
As
 
suggested
 
in
 
the

1.
 
Understanding
 
Impact:
 
Mapping
 
The
 
Council's
 
research,
 
advisory
 
and
 
outreach
 
—
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
had
 
(from
 
outputs
 
to
 
outcomes)
 
with
 
exciting
 
visuals
 
and
 
testimonials.
 
2.
 
Understanding
 
Growth
:
 
Analysing
 
perceptions
 
around
 
The
 
Council’s
 
growth
 
being
 
organic,
 
planned
 
or
 
strategic;
 
areas
 
where
 
we
 
have
 
surpassed
 
expectations
 
and
 
where
 
potential
 
remains
 
not
 
fully
 
realised.
 
3.
 
Understanding
 
Visibility
:
 
Analysing
 
The
 
Council’s
 
approach
 
towards
 
data
 
and
 
strategic
 
outreach,
 
its
 
commitment
 
to
 
transparency
 
and
 
its
 
position
 
in
 
the
 
public
 
mindset.
 
4.
 
Understanding
 
Risks
:
 
Analysing
 
how
 
donors
 
perceive
 
The
 
Council’s
 
governance
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
risks
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
must
 
be
 
resilient
 
against,
 
whether
 
emanating
 
from
 
internal
 
processes,
 
external
 
environment
 
or
 
strategic
 
directions.
 
5.
 
Understanding
 
Demand
:
 
Assessing
 
what
 
donors
 
want
 
and
 
ﬁnding
 
points
 
of
 
synergy
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
approaches
 
without
 
compromising
 
on
 
The
 
Council’s
 
well-earned
 
independence
 
6.
 
Understanding
 
our
 
value-proposition
:
 
Assessing
 
perceptions
 
on
 
The

Overview
 
of
 
the
 
organisation
 
-
 
The
 
Council
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
completed
 
10
 
years
 
of
 
existence
 
in
 
2020.
 
The
 
organisation
 
has
 
evolved
 
into
 
a
 
world
 
class
 
organisation
 
putting
 
people
 
at
 
the
 
centre
 
of
 
world-class
 
research.
 
The
 
journey
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
ranges
 
from
 
the
 
inputs
 
to
 
the
 
12th
 
Five
 
Year
 
plan
 
in
 
2011
 
to
 
a
 
study
 
on
 
the
 
macroeconomic
 
cost
 
of
 
inaction
 
on
 
water
 
efﬁciency
 
in
 
2020.
  
Currently
 
with
 
over
 
a
 
decade
 
of
 
experience
 
 
The
 
Council
 
currently
 
has
 
eight

Some
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
achievements
 
in
 
a
 
decade
 
long
 
journey
 
are
 
highlighted
 
below
 
1.
 
In
 
the
 
domain
 
of
 
energy
 
access,
 
extensive
 
primary
 
data,
 
and
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
government
 
led
 
to
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
Saubhagya
 
scheme
 
to
 
achieve
 
universal
 
household
 
electriﬁcation,
 
impacting
 
125
 
million
 
lives.
 
 
2.
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
been
 
futuristic
 
in
 
its
 
outlook
 
as
 
well
 
with
 
its
 
analysis
 
for
 
the
 
Prime
 
Minister’s
 
Ofﬁce
 
which
 
contributed
 
to
 
setting
 
the
 
target
 
of
 
175
 
GW
 
of
 
renewables
 
by
 
2022.
 
 
3.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
transforming
 
markets
 
for
 
good
 
with
 
the
 
establishment
 
of
 
the
 
CEEW
 
Centre
 
for
 
Energy
 
Finance
 
in
 
2019,
 
the
 
USD
 
3
 
million
 
Powering
 
Livelihoods
 
initiative,
 
a
 
power
 
sector
 
project
 
in
 
Uttar
 
Pradesh
 
impacting
 
7.2
 
million
 
consumers
 
is
 
an
 
example
 
of
 
the
 
same.
 
 
4.
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
been
 
pivotal
 
in
 
envisioning
 
Mission
 
80-80-80.
 
The
 
mission
 
aims
 
to
 
reduce
 
air
 
pollution
 
by
 
80
 
per
 
cent
 
in
 
80
 
cities
 
by
 
2027,
 
when
 
India
 
will
 
turn
 
80
 
as
 
an
 
independent
 
nation
 
and
 
demand
 
year-round
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
lives
 
and
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
80
 
percent
 
of
 
Indians
 
breathing
 
unhealthy
 
air.
 
5.
 
Low-carbon
 
pathways
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
focus
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
recent
 
years,
 
through
 
complex
 
modelling
 
of
 
over
 
200+
 
scenarios
 
The
 
Council
 
managed
 
to
 
create
 
the
 
largest
 
database
 
on
 
India's
 
industrial
 
GHG
 
emissions:
 
and
 
are
 
now
 
contributing
 
to
 
drafting
 
the
 
National
 
Hydrogen
 
Mission
 
as
 
a
 
foundation
 
of
 
low-carbon
 
industrialisation.
 
 
6.
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
been
 
instrumental
 
in
 
building
 
trust
 
between
 
governments
 
thereby
 
ensuring
 
the
 
agenda
 
of
 
climate
 
change
 
is
 
advanced
 
on
 
the
 
global
 
level
 
as
 
well.
 
 
With
 
over
 
a
 
decade
 
of
 
experience
 
across
 
multiple
 
areas
 
of
 
work
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
in
 
a
 
transitional
 
phase
 
moving
 
from
 
transactional
 
to
 
transformational.
 
 
Key
 
Performance
 
Indicators,
 
Impact
 
Metrics,
 
and
 
Gender
 
KPIs
 
There
 
are
 
several
 
KPIs
 
and
 
Impact
 
Metrics
 
that
 
CEEW
 
uses
 
to
 
report
 
on
 
the
 
aspect
 
of
 
their
 
perf
ormance.
 
They
 
have
 
determined
 
KPIs
 
and
 
metrics
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
strategy
 
and
 
experiences.
 
The
 
KPIs
 
are
 
focused
 
on
 
criterias
 
like
 
reports
 
published,
 
media
 
coverage
 
and
 
engagement
 
with
 
governments,
 
gender
 
structure
 
etc.
 
These
 
are
 
measurable
 
values
 
meant
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
how
 
effectively
 
CEEW
 
is
 
achieving
 
its
 
key
 
objective
 
and
 
also
 
captures
 
the
 
essence
 
of
 
their
 
overall
 
success.
 
These
 
indicators
 
and
 
metrics
 
can
 
add
 
substantial
 
value
 
to
 
CEEW
 
by
 
collectively
 
framing
 
issues
 
of
 
importance,
 
providing
 
deep
 
insights
 
into
 
project/programme
 
performance,
 
illustrating
  
their
 
strengths

Hence
 
these

To
 
assess

they
 
use
 
19

(KPIs)
 
was
 
used
 
to

CEEW,
 
enabling
 
them
 
to

which
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
step
 
toward
 
making
 
real,

Journey
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
so
 
far
 
and
 
Vision
 
2030
 
The
 
discussions
 
on
 
high
 
level
 
strategy
 
was
 
with
 
Dr.
 
Arunabha
 
Ghosh
 
where
 
the
 
conversation
 
was
 
largely
 
focused
 
on
 
the
 
journey
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
since
 
inception
 
and
 
the
 
future
 
aspirations
 
and
 
directions
 
as
 
an
 
institution.
 
The
 
discussions
 
with
 
research
 
portfolio
 
directors
 
and
 
key
 
personnel
 
assisted
 
us
 
with
 
the
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
diverse
 
operational
 
frameworks,
 
The
 
Council
 
deploys
 
in
 
delivering
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
engagement
 
and
 
eventually
 
the
 
impact
 
for
 
the
 
sector,
 
donors
 
etc.
 
The
 
conversations
 
with
 
the
 
enabler
 
functions
 
such
 
as
 
Finance
 
and
 
HR
 
was
 
extremely
 
helpful
 
in
 
understanding
 
the
 
key
 
strengths
 
and
 
challenges
 
at
 
The
 
Council.
  
 
Current
 
engagements
 
and
 
approaches
 
The
 
research
 
portfolio
 
directors
 
are
 
the
 
key
 
engagement
 
personnel
 
for
 
both
 
grantee
 
management
 
and
 
programme
 
management
 
across
 
the
 
grant
 
making
 
organisations
 
and
 
the
 
donors.
 
Engagement
 
strategy
 
is
 
currently
 
driven
 
by
 
individual
 
portfolios
 
and
 
directors
 
of
 
the
 
portfolio
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁnance
 
team
 
coming
 
in
 
only
 
for
 
accounting
 
and
 
compliance
 
requirements.
 
The
 
current
 
approach
 
is
 
illustrated
 
below.
 
 
The
 
Council
 
as
 
a
 
front
 
running
 
climate
 
action
 
think
 
tank
 
occupies
 
a
 
unique
 
market
 
position,
 
partnerships
 
and
 
people
 
attracting
 
major
 
FCRA
 
funding,
 
owing
 
to
 
the
 
limited
 
competition,
 
market
 
positioning,
 
capabilities
 
etc.
 
in
 
the
 
policy
 
think
 
tank
 
space
 
and
 
the
 
expertise
 
and
 
engagement
 
space,
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
built
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
10
 
years.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
early
 
grants
 
The
 
Council
 
had
 
secured
 
could
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
The
 
Council
 
being
 
a
 
fresh
 
voice
 
in
 
the
 
sector,
 
but
 
now
 
gradually
 
the
 
9
 


 
institutional
 
capacities
 
are
 
being
 
recognized
 
by
 
donors.
 
Overall
 
the
 
current
 
engagement
 
strategy
 
has
 
evolved
 
organically
 
and
 
is
 
largely
 
been
 
driven
 
by
 
the
 
leadership
 
group.
 
However
 
going
 
forward
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
conscious
 
effort
 
to
 
move
 
away
 
from
 
individuals
 
to
 
the
 
institution.
 
 
Challenges
 
and
 
limitations
 
The
 
key
 
challenges
 
and
 
the
 
limitations
 
of
 
the
 
organizations
 
are
 
captured
 
in
 
this
 
section.
 
Concentration
 
of
 
FCRA
 
funds
 
The
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
funding
 
The
 
Council
 
currently
 
handles
 
are
 
tagged
 
through
 
internations
 
sources,
 
FCRA
 
classiﬁed/
 
With
 
the
 
recent
 
restrictions
 
to
 
the
 
FCRA
 
rules,
 
there
 
are
 
clear
 
concentration
 
risks
 
and
 
hence
 
it
 
is
 
imperative
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
looks
 
to
 
pivot
 
towards
 
domestic
 
funds
 
(untied
 
and
 
institutional
 
per
 
say)
 
to
 
offset
 
the
 
risk
 
posed
 
by
 
high
 
concentration
 
of
 
FCRA
 
funds.
 
 
Key
 
Person
 
Risk
 
It
 
was
 
evident
 
from
 
the
 
conversation
 
with
 
the
 
Leadership
 
group
 
that
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
funding
 
is
 
managed
 
by
 
a
 
siloed
 
core
 
hub
 
at
 
The
 
council,
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
engagements
 
are
 
front
 
ended
 
and
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
core
 
group
 
as
 
well.
 
This
 
was
 
speciﬁcally
 
highlighted
 
during
 
the
 
conversation
 
on
 
the
 
people
 
strategy
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
planned
 
going
 
forward.
 
 
Outcome
 
based
 
funding
 
Outcome
 
based
 
funding
 
has
 
become
 
more
 
commonstance
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
years,
 
this
 
has
 
resulted
 
in
 
a
 
lack
 
of

is
 
a
 
challenge.
 
Integrated
 
communications
 
Currently
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
standardized
 
systems
 
or
 
processes
 
in
 
place
 
for
 
communications
 
with
 
donors.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
raised
 
by
 
few
 
donors
 
as
 
a
 
pain
 
point.
 
The
 
communications
 
lead
 
pointed
 
to
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
deﬁnite
 
challenge
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
lack
 
of
 
integrated
 
communication
 
at
 
the
 
organization
 
level.
 
Currently
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
strategic

with
 
the

as
 
well.
 
 
Opportunities
 
and
 
strengths
 
Leadership
 
 
The
 
vision
 
of
 
the
 
leader,
 
Dr.Arunabha
 
Ghosh
 
is
 
clearly
 
a
 
big
 
strength
 
for
 
the
 
organization.
 
His
 
thought
 
leadership
 
along
 
with
 
his
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
sector
 
as
 
a
 
whole
 
brings
 
in
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
The
 
Council.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
instrumental
 
in
 
The
 
Council
 
achieving
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
success
 
it
 
has
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
10
 
years.

People
 
People
 
are
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
The
 
Council,
 
the
 
form
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
strategy
 
of
 
the
 
organization.
 
The
 
biggest
 
value
 
proposition
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
to
 
offer
 
is
 
its
 
people.
 
The
 
attrition
 
rates
 
are
 
extremely
 
low
 
and
 
the
 
tenures
 
of
 
its
 
employees
 
are
 
fairly
 
long.
 
The
 
leadership
 
and
 
learning
 
pathways
 
are
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
and
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
young
 
leaders
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
nurtured.
 
 
Transparency
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
transparent
 
in
 
putting
 
out
 
their
 
views,
 
few
 
people
 
see
 
The
 
Council
 
as
 
close
 
with
 
the
 
government
 
but
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
can
 
criticize
 
the
 
government
 
as
 
well.
 
This
 
puts
 
them
 
in
 
a
 
unique
 
position
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
sought
 
after
 
for
 
both
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
and
 
critique
 
the
 
government.
 
 
Futuristic
 
outlook
 
Identifying
 
key
 
issues
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
and
 
investing
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
has
 
been
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
strengths
 
of
 
the
 
organization.
 
The
 
Councils’
 
work
 
in
 
cooling
 
and
 
hydrogen
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
example
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
shaping
 
the
 
agenda
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
by
 
predicting
 
key
 
issues
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
and
 
starting
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
same.
 
 
Key
 
questions
 
for
 
the
 
donors
 
The
 
key
 
questions
 
for
 
the
 
donor
 
that
 
came
 
from
 
the
 
conversations
 
with
 
the
 
leadership
 
group
 
are
 
as
 
follows,
 
please
 
do
 
note
 
that
 
these
 
are
 
not
 
exhaustive
 
and
 
a
 
larger
 
framework
 
has
 
been
 
detailed
 
out
 
later
 
in
 
the
 
report.
 
Project
 
and
 
programmatic
 
funding
 
come
 
with
 
its
 
own
 
set
 
of
 
constraints
 
and
 
challenges,
 
The
 
council
 
is
 
looking
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
donors
 
view
 
these
 
and
 
the
 
ways
 
in
 
which
 
they
 
differentiate
 
the
 
same.
 
Measuring
 
impact
 
of
 
a
 
think
 
tank's
 
work
 
is
 
very
 
difﬁcult,
 
while
 
outputs
 
can
 
be
 
measured
 
with
 
preset
 
metrics
 
and
 
deliverables,
 
measuring
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
those
 
outputs
 
is
 
difﬁcult.
 
From
 
a
 
donor
 
perspective
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
impact
 
metrics
 
they
 
look
 
before
 
deciding
 
on
 
an
 
organization
 
to
 
fund
 
is
 
a
 
question
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
looking
 
at.
 
 
Climate
 
change
 
speciﬁc
 
agendas
 
are
 
capturing
 
the
 
donors
 
attention
 
a
 
lot
 
these
 
days,
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
impact
 
they
 
look
 
for
 
when
 
funding
 
these
 
projects
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
question
 
for
 
the
 
donor.
 
The
 
leadership
 
group
 
at
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
been
 
crucial
 
in
 
building
 
the
 
relationships
 
the
 
organization
 
currently
 
has
 
with
 
the
 
donors.
 
This
 
brings
 
in
 
key
 
person
 
risks
 
which
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
explored
 
with
 
the
 
donors.
 
The
 
way
 
the
 
donors
 
view
 
the
 
institutions
 
versus
 
the
 
individuals
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand.
 
The
 
importance
 
of
 
gender
 
based
 
representation
 
in
 
the
 
board
 
and
 
senior
 
leadership
 
from
 
a
 
donors’
 
perspective.
 
 
The
 
Council
 
believes
 
that
 
transparency
 
sets
 
them
 
apart
 
from
 
their
 
peers,
 
this
 
was
 
emphasized
 
in
 
almost
 
every
 
conversation
 
we
 
had
 
with
 
the
 
leadership
 
group.
 
Is
 
this
 
something
 
that
 
the
 
existing
 
donors
 
feel
 
as
 
well
 
and
 
how
 
important
 
is
 
transparency
 
for
 
potential
 
donors
 
is
 
a
 
question
 
the
 
study
 
11
 


 
hopes
 
to
 
answer.
 
Although
 
the
 
relationship
 
with
 
existing
 
donors
 
is
 
good,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
many
 
of
 
them
 
act
 
as
 
brand
 
ambassadors
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
where
 
they
 
promote
 
The
 
Council
 
while
 
engaging
 
with
 
other
 
players
 
in
 
the
 
ecosystem.
 
This
 
point
 
also
 
leads
 
to
 
the
 
question
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
engagement
 
mechanisms
 
and
 
the
 
way
 
donors
 
view
 
the
 
same,
 
points
 
of
 
concerns
 
and
 
issues
 
the
 
donors
 
might
 
have
 
for
 
The
 
Council.
  
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
almost
 
doubled
 
its
 
numbers
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
year,
 
the
 
existing
 
donors
 
might
 
view
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
negative
 
as
 
the
 
increased
 
numbers
 
might
 
reduce
 
the
 
focus
 
on
 
existing
 
donors,
 
can
 
have
 
some
 
implications
 
on
 
the
 
timeliness
 
leading
 
to
 
cost
 
extensions
 
etc.
 
 
Expectations
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
 
The
 
key
 
expectations
 
from
 
the

Baseline
 
of

team
 
indicated
 
that
 
the
 
current
 
awareness
 
levels
 
amongst
 
the
 
donors
 
both
 
domestic
 
and
 
international
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
assessed
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
study.
 
This
 
includes
 
awareness
 
amongst
 
existing
 
donors,
 
key
 
sectoral
 
players
 
and
 
the
 
potential
 
donors.

Understanding
 
how
 
the
 
existing

view
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
an
 
expectation
 
from
 
the
 
study,
 
these
 
will
 
be
 
captured
 
along
 
the
 
dimensions
 
of
 
Demand,

Study
 
Framework
 
 
The
 
proposed
 
study
 
framework
 
effectively
 
encompasses
 
the
 
six
 
major
 
evaluation
 
criteria
 
presented
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
as
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
studys’
 
TOR.
 
The
 
Framework
 
intends
 
to
 
bring
 
together
 
the
 
aspects
 
of
 
secondary
 
landscaping
 
exercise
 
to
 
address
 
key
 
components
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
such
 
as
 
understanding
 
the
 
sectoral
 
perception,
 
positioning
 
and
 
aspects
 
of
 
institutional
 
benchmarking
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
engagement,
 
processes,
 
impact
 
and
 
sustainability.
 
The
 
second
 
integrating
 
component
 
would
 
interject
 
the
 
aspects
 
of
 
donor
 
perception
 
on
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
vice
 
versa
 
and
 
insights
 
coming
 
in
 
from
 
the
 
primary
 
interactions
 
(KIIs
 
with
 
donors)
 
and
 
self

surveys
 
(perception
 
surveys)
 
with
 
the
 
existing
 
and
 
potential
 
donor
 
communities.

Given
 
the
 
theoretical
 
expectations
 
from
 
the

key
 
indicator
 
sets
 
we
 
would
 
focus
 
on
 
during
 
the

exercise.
 
 
Guiding

Approach
 
Arunabhas’
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
sector
 
and
 
the
 
institution
 
 
From
 
the
 
conversations
 
with
 
the
 
leadership
 
group
 
at
 
The
 
Council
 
we
 
understand
 
that
 
The
 
Councils’
 
vision
 
is
 
to
 
 
●
 
Become
 
a
 
world
 
class
 
institution
 
in
 
data,
 
outreach
 
and
 
analysis
 
of
 
global
 
signiﬁcance
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
impact
 
at
 
scale,
 
 
23
 


 
●
 
Move
 
sustainability
 
from
 
the
 
“Margin”
 
to
 
“Mainstream”
 
by
 
working
 
across
 
the
 
themes
 
of
 
policy,
 
technology,
 
ﬁnance
 
and
 
behaviour
 
to
 
move
 
from
 
a
 
policy
 
advisory
 
to
 
a
 
mainstream
 
economy.
  
 
This
 
requires
 
working
 
with
 
donors
 
that
 
can
 
make
 
this
 
journey
 
from
 
transactional
 
to
 
transformational
 
a
 
reality
 
betting
 
on
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
investing
 
in
 
the
 
same.
 
This
 
vision
 
of
 
The
 
Council,
 
requires
 
donors
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
domains
 
of
 
sustainability
 
across
 
the
 
spectrum
  
of
 
food,
 
agriculture,
 
water,
 
energy
 
etc.
 
With
 
the
 
impending
 
risk
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
FCRA
 
laws
 
it
 
is
 
paramount
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
looks
 
at
 
local
 
donors
 
who
 
can
 
be
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
The
 
Councils’
 
journey
 
going
 
forward.
 
These
 
are
 
donors
 
who
 
would
 
 
●
 
Invest
 
in
 
the
 
institution
 
development
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
build
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
of
 
the
 
organization.
 
 
●
 
Invest
 
in
 
integrated
 
ideas
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
restrict
 
their
 
funds
 
to
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
sector/domain,
 
make
 
big
 
bets
 
to
 
achieve
 
transformation
 
across
 
the

Our
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
Indian
 
R&amp;D
 
funding
 
reveals
 
that
 
there
 
was
 
an
 
overall
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
ﬂow
 
of
 
funds
 
towards
 
the
 
Climate
 
Change
 
Sector.
 
Even
 
though
 
the
 
Natural
 
Resource
 
Sector
 
remained
 
the
 
27
 


 
main
 
area
 
of
 
funding,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
downward
 
trend
 
of
 
funding
 
observed
 
from
 
2017-2019.
 
The
 
funding
 
towards
 
Policy,
 
advocacy
 
and
 
systems
 
reform
 
was
 
the
 
highest
 
followed
 
by
 
Capacity-building
 
and
 
technical

strategy.
 
Lastly,
 
Axis
 
Bank

Reliance

emerged
 
as
 
the
 
top
 
funders
 
during
 
the
 
period
 
of
 
2017
 
to

Thus
 
this
 
gives
 
us
 
an
 
overall
 
picture
 
on

The

is
 
clearly
 
positioned
 
to
 
take
 
advantage
 
of
 
this
 
movement,
 
the
 
recent
 
inception
 
of
 
the

However
 
the
 
strategic
 
alignment
 
of
 
CSR
 
investments
 
are
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
following
 
three
 
key
 
aspects.
 
●
 
CSR
 
funds
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
complying
 
to
 
CSR
 
rules
 
and

and
 
others)
 
 
●
 
Designing
 
and
 
delivering
 
programs
 
meeting
 
their
 
proportioned
 
annual
 
budget
 
and
 
showcasing
 
visible
 
outcomes
 
in
 
short
 
gestation
 
●
 
Post
 
pandemic,
 
the
 
CSR
 
managers
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
vulnerable
 
populations
 
on
 
livelihoods,
 
healthcare
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
social
 
protection
  
ﬁnancial
 
services
 
Between
 
2015
 
to
 
2020,
 
the
 
spending
 
from
 
CSR
 
activities
 
is
 
estimated
 
to
 
be
 
INR
 
79,293
 
Crores
 
and
 
the
 
environmental
 
sustainability
 
spending
 
is
 
around
 
8%
 
for
 
environmental
 
sustainability.
  
The
 
average
 
spending
 
on
 
CSR
 
activities
 
per
 
organisation
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
5
 
years
 
ranges
 
from
 
INR
 
65
 
L
 
to
 
INR
 
75
 
L
 
per
 
year.
 
With
 
the
 
new
 
CSR
 
rules,
 
there
 
can
 
be
 
multi
 
year
 
CSR
 
investments
 
are
 
allowed
 
and
 
ﬁrms
 
are
 
allowed
 
to
 
set
 
off
  
surplus
 
spending
  
upto
 
3
 
years.
 
 
Though
 
CSR
 
funds
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
available
 
consistently
 
every
 
year,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
strategic
 
misalignment,
 
especially
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
funding
 
to
 
short
 
term
 
projects
 
or
 
programs
 
but
 
not
 
evidence
 
generation
 
to
 
inform
 
policy,
 
transformative
 
causes
 
or
 
developing
 
research
 
institutions.

Though
 
the

are
 
having
 
limited
 
access
 
to
 
investments
 
and

opportunities
 
for

initiatives,
 
there
 
is
 
wider
 
opportunity
 
for

There
 
is
 
a
 
wider
 
opportunity
 
for
 
Cement
 
companies
 
to
 
provide
 
sectoral
 
guidance
 
on
 
low
 
carbon

The
 
more

invest
 
on

on

This
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
statement
 
for
 
the
 
banking
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
services
 
sector
 
to
 
design
 
ﬁnancial
 
products
 
that
 
promote
 
an
 
objective
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
positive
 
impact
 
on
 
the

and
 
this

is

another

and
 
it
 
intends
 
go

There
 
is
 
a
 
wider
 
scope
 
for
 
pursuing
 
low
 
carbon

and
 
access
 
to

In

there
 
is
 
no

from
 
the
 
Indian
 
sustainability
 
landscape
 
to
 
capture
 
from

however,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
resounding

development
 
opportunities
 
in
 
providing
 
insightful
 
guidance
 
in
 
designing
 
ﬁnancial
 
products
 
and

Accordingly,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
wider

to
 
ﬁnance,
 
promoting
 
sectoral

towards
 
a

approach
 
with

of
 
a

Given
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
Indian

story,
 
the
 
nature
 
of

has
 
changed
 
as

in
 
the

Indian
 
domestic
 
philanthropy
 
has
 
changed
 
quite
 
a
 
bit
 
in
 
recent
 
years,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
absolute
 
numbers
 
the

has
 
grown
 
from

12.5K

in
 
2010
 
to
 
INR
 
55K
 
crore
 
in
 
2018.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
predominantly
 
driven
 
by
 
landmark
 
commitments
 
by
 
a
 
few
 
Indian
 
and
 
Indian-origin
 
families
  
which
 
includes

These
 
families
 
have
 
joined
 
the

as

towards
 
bolder

and
 
a

movement
 
towards
 
a
 
more
 
structured
 
approach
 
with
 
involvement
 
of
 
a

There
 
is
 
a
 
gradual
 
shift
 
towards

trend
 
of
 
new
 
roles
 
and
 
actors
 
entering
 
the
 
philanthropic
 
sector
 
as
 
service
 
providers.
 
Below
 
diagram
 
captures
 
the
 
various
 
services
 
and
 
support
 
functions
 
that
 
have
 
emerged
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
decade
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
philanthropic
 
ecosystem.

Following
 
are
 
the
 
areas
 
from
 
the
 
perspective
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
scope
 
of
 
engagement.
 
 
1.
 
Research
 
and
 
advisory
 
-
  
In
 
terms
 
of
 
research
 
and
 
advisory
 
services,
 
assisting
 
philanthropists
 
to
 
take
 
an
 
evidence
 
based
 
approach
 
to
 
deploying
 
funds
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
key
 
value
 
add.
 
 
2.
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation
 
and
 
Learning
 
-
 
Reporting
 
is
 
another
 
key
 
area
 
where
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
movement
 
has
 
happened
 
,
 
this
 
has
 
resulted
 
in
 
promotion
 
of
 
a
 
culture
 
of
 
monitoring,
 
evaluation
 
and
 
learning
 
across
 
the
 
sector,
 
which
 
results
 
in
 
better
 
donor
 
reporting.
 
3.
 
Collective,
 
visioning,
 
giving
 
and
 
learning
 
-
 
Mobilizing
 
multiple
 
stakeholders
 
towards
 
collaborative
 
giving
 
,
  
resulting
 
in
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
investment-ready
 
solutions
 
for
 
large-scale
 
impact.

of
 
trust
 
it
 
emerges
 
that
 
one
 
needs
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
innovative
 
model/approach
 
to
 
overcome
 
the
 
numerous
 
predicaments.
 
With
 
the
 
changing
 
funding
 
landscape
 
and
 
limited
 
means
 
of
 
communication
 
with
 
the
 
donors/stakeholders
 
there
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
development
 
theory
 
on
 
how
 
an
 
institution
 
accomplishes
 
its
 
mission.
 
 
Given
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
context,
 
adapting
 
to
 
new
 
strategic
 
approaches
 
to
 
identifying
 
funders,
 
entering
 
into
 
sequential
 
funding
 
/
 
long
 
term
 
funding
 
investment
 
agendas
 
etc.
 
seems
 
inevitable
 
and
 
worth
 
studying
 
for.
 
The
 
strategies
 
should
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
management
 
hypothesis
 
about
 
what
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
want,
 
how
 
they
 
want
 
it,
 
and
 
how
 
a
 
think
 
tank
 
can
 
use
 
its
 
resources
 
to
 
the
 
best
 
to
 
meet
 
those
 
needs,
 
get
 
paid
 
for
 
doing
 
so
 
and
 
achieve
 
its
 
mission.
 
 
Secondary
 
research
 
suggests
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
several
 
adaptable
 
strategies
 
and
 
conceptual
 
approaches
 
for
 
an
 
institution
 
to
 
be
 
successful
 
and
 
sustained
 
over
 
time.
 
Some
 
of
 
these
 
are
 
mentioned
 
below:-

the
 
core
 
activities

potential

for
 
this

could
 
be
 
shortlisted.
 
Eg.
 
Rohini

Here
 
the

is
 
on

organisations
 
(as
 
per
 
aforementioned
 
disaggregation
 
and
 
ﬁltering)
 
that
 
rally
 
around
 
a
 
shared
 
idea,
 
which
 
results
 
in
 
their
 
not
 
only
 
pooling
 
resources
 
but
 
also
 
thinking
 
about
 
how
 
to
 
formulate
 
integrated
 
solutions
 
to
 
problems
 
at
 
scale.
 
Eg:

for
 
a

a

where
 
the
 
sectoral
 
needs

overlap
 
with
 
the
 
regulatory
 
direction,
 
compliance
 
and

for

groups
 
In
 
this
 
section
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
key
 
decision
 
making
 
elements
 
that
 
philanthropists,
 
HNIs,
 
Diaspora
 
led
 
funders
 
look
 
at
 
across
 
various
 
components
 
and
 
the
 
larger
 
proﬁle
 
of
 
donors
 
and
 
grant
 
making
 
organisations
 
that
 
suits
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
‘The

Motivation
 
for
 
the
 
donor
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
key
 
decision
 
making
 
elements
 
for
 
a
 
donor
 
organisation
 
looking
 
from
 
a
 
lens
 
of
 
the
 
primary
 
motivations
 
for
 
the
 
decision
 
to
 
fund.
 
 
 
These
 
choices
 
are
 
not
 
exhaustive,
 
there
 
are
 
several
 
other
 
points
 
on
 
which
 
decisions
 
might
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
made,
 
and
 
many
 
more
 
choices
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
donor.
 
The
 
extreme
 
choices
 
discussed
 
and
 
choices
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
continuum
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
extremes
 
aren’t
 
the
 
only
 
ones
 
available.
 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
requirements
 
highlighted
 
by
 
‘The
 
Council’,
 
philanthropists,
 
philanthropic
 
houses,
 
HNIs,
 
diaspora
 
led
 
funders
 
etc.
 
falling
 
under
 
the
 
junction
 
of
 
the
 
below
 
decision
 
choices
 
would
 
ﬁt
 
best.
 
These
 
donors
 
proﬁled
 
since
 
funding
 
out
 
of
 
choice
 
have
 
more
 
ﬂexibility
 
in
 
their
 
approach,
 
with
 
the
 
recent
 
trend
 
of
 
funders
 
taking
 
more
 
ownership
 
of
 
their
 
interventions
 
‘The
 
Council’
 
is
 
well
 
positioned
 
to
 
leverage
 
funding
 
for
 
research
 
and
 
design
 
and
 
not
 
just
 
implementation
 
33
 


 
as
 
is
 
the
 
case
 
with
 
funders
 
who
 
support
 
causes.
 
Sustainability
 
is
 
an
 
overarching
 
theme
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
work
 
‘The
 
Council’
 
undertakes,
 
at
 
times
 
this
 
requires
 
working
 
on
 
complex
 
nexus
 
of
 
sustainability
 
issues,
 
interdisciplinary
 
and
 
multidisciplinary
 
hypothesis
 
etc.
 
which
 
might
 
put
 
the
 
research
 
and
 
funding
 
needs
 
at
 
cross
 
hairs
 
with
 
national
 
priorities
 
aimed
 
at
 
economic
 
development
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
key
 
stakeholders,
 
governments
 
and
 
quasi-governments
 
in
 
the
 
ecosystem,
 
hence
 
a
 
funder
 
who
 
is
 
willing
 
to
 
fund
 
these
 
tough
 
grounds
 
is
 
extremely
 
crucial.
 
 
 
Methods
 
for
 
translating
 
philanthropic
 
intent
 
 
Fig.
 
X
 
represented
 
below,
 
depicts
 
the
 
key
 
decision
 
points
 
that
 
donors
 
have
 
to
 
take
 
on
 
the
 
various
 
methods
 
on
 
how
 
intent
 
gets
 
translated
 
into
 
a
 
strategy
 
and
 
approach
 
to
 
work.
 
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
achieve
 
the
 
larger
 
goals
 
of
 
‘The
 
Council’
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
methods
 
of
 
delivering
 
philanthropic
 
intent
 
below
 
is
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
methods
 
that
 
are
 
required.
 
Transformative
 
funding
 
is
 
key
 
for
 
realising
 
the
 
vision
 
‘The
 
Council’
 
has
 
for
 
2030,
 
funding
 
causes
 
and
 
work
 
that
 
creates
 
long
 
term
 
conditions
 
such
 
that
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
people
 
needing
 
curative
 
help
 
decreases.
 
‘The
 
Councils’
 
key
 
strength
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
key
 
discussions
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
young
 
,
 
dynamic
 
and
 
diverse
 
team.
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
the
 
potential
 
donors
 
to
 
be
 
comfortable
 
working
 
in
 
this
 
environment
 
that
 
would
 
foster
 
new
 
ideas,
 
perspectives
 
and
 
criticisms.
  
Lastly
 
it
 
is
 
paramount
 
that
 
the
 
funder
 
is
 
patient
 
with
 
the
 
capital
 
employed
 
and
 
looks
 
at
 
building
 
expertise
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
term.

Rohini
 
Nilekani
 
Foundation
 
Philanthropy
 
perspective:
 
The
 
philanthropy
 
is
 
keen
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
collaborations
 
among
 
institutions,
 
ideas
 
and
 
individuals
 
delivering
 
path-breaking
 
work
 
that
 
promotes
 
a
 
strong
 
samaaj
 
with
 
ethical
 
leadership,
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
urgency
 
and
 
the
 
courage
 
to
 
learn.
 
Accordingly,
 
philanthropy
 
believes
 
and
 
works
 
for
 
the
 
revival
 
of
 
communities
 
and
 
builds
 
capacity
 
to
 
meet
 
their
 
functions
 
and
 
duties
 
towards
 
their
 
progress.
 
They
 
invest
 
in
 
institutions
 
that
 
co-create
 
and
 
enable
 
governance
 
among
 
the
 
community
 
institutions.

in
 
the
 
ﬁnancial

Opportunities
 
ahead:
 
The
 
funding
 
principle
 
and
 
community
 
centric
 
solutions
 
would
 
be
 
critical
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
with
 
this
 
philanthropy.
 
They
 
work
 
closely
 
with
 
various
 
government
 
agencies
 
and
 
ensure
 
to
 
implement
 
sustainable
 
solutions
 
to
 
the
 
last
 
mile.
 
The
 
Council
 
could
 
work
 
across
 
landscape
 
research
 
on
 
pan
 
country
 
level
 
environmental
 
challenges
 
especially
 
inﬂuencing
 
government
 
agencies
 
both
 
in
 
policies
 
and
 
in
 
implementation.
 
The
 
policy
 
to
 
action
 
would
 
be
 
possible
 
working
 
with
 
various
 
government
 
agencies
 
and
 
could
 
happen
 
the
 
other
 
way
 
the
 
actioned
 
activities
 
could
 
be
 
studied
 
to
 
be
 
translated
 
into
 
policy
 
level
 
discussions
 
among
 
bureaucrats
 
and
 
government
 
agencies.
 
Potential
 
limitations
 
The
 
funding
 
may
 
be
 
tied
 
to
 
speciﬁc
 
research
 
outputs
 
addressing
 
the
 
critical
 
problem
 
statements
 
presented
 
or
 
the
 
solutions
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
implemented.
 
In
 
summary
 
they
 
may
 
fund
 
without
 
FCRA
 
compliance
 
but
 
they
 
may
 
have
 
equivalent
 
requirements
 
and
 
could
 
be
 
an
 
untied
 
fund
 
and
 
they
 
entirely
 
depend
 
on
 
contractual
 
obligations.

EDGE
 
works
 
towards
 
two
 
main
 
goals:
 
●
 
BUILDING
 
COMMUNITY:
 
They
 
facilitate
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
connections
 
and
 
trust
 
between
 
individuals
 
and
 
organisations
 
who
 
share
 
the
 
conviction
 
that
 
systemic
 
answers
 
are
 
essential
  
to
 
address
 
the
 
interconnected
 
crisis
 
situation
 
of
 
our
 
times
 
–
 
a
 
home
 
for
 
systemic
 
change
 
philanthropy.
 
●
 
CHANGING
 
PHILANTHROPY:
 
They
 
build
 
a
 
consistent
 
voice
 
to
 
challenge
 
the
 
philanthropy
 
sector
 
and
 
shift
 
practice
 
towards
 
accountable
 
relationships
 
supporting
 
systemic
 
change
 
and
 
transformative
 
actors.
 
 
Funding
 
platform:
 
They
 
have
 
various
 
funding
 
models
 
and
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
signiﬁcant
 
funding
 
models
 
is
 
Participatory
 
Funding
 
model.

decided
 
to
 
pool
 
funding.
 
Decision-making
 
is
 
a
 
learning
 
tool
 
for
 
FundAction
 
members.
 
By
 
reviewing,
 
discussing

creating
 
a
 
collaborative
 
community

overlap
 
with
 
the
 
regulatory
 
direction,
 
compliance
 
and
 
market
 
growth.
 
The
 
Council
 
could
 
leverage
 
in
 
collaborating
 
key
 
research
 
partners
 
/
 
a
 
guiding
 
think

in
 
this

Climate
 
Pledge
 
Fund
 
 
The
 
climate
 
pledge
 
is
 
a
 
cross-sector
 
community
 
of
 
corporations,
 
organizations,
 
individuals,
 
and
 
partners,
 
working
 
together
 
to
 
crack
 
the
 
climate
 
crisis
 
and
 
solve
 
the
 
challenges
 
of
 
decarbonizing
 
their
 
existing
 
value
 
chain
 
and
 
eventually
 
the
 
nation's
 
economy.
 
The
 
climate
 
pledge
 
fund
 
in
 
speciﬁc
 
is
 
a
 
corporate
 
venture
 
capital
 
fund
 
that
 
invests
 
in
 
companies
 
across
 
multiple
 
industry
 
sectors
 
with
 
a
 
common
 
theme
 
of
 
sustainable
 
and
 
decarbonizing
 
technologies
 
and
 
services.
 
The
 
Council
 
could
 
potentially
 
leverage
 
the
 
investor
 
network
 
investing
 
on
 
integrated
 
ideas
 
and
 
not
 
be
 
restricted
 
by
 
their
 
funds
 
to
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
sector/domain
 
that
 
delivers
 
a
 
larger
 
change
 
across
 
the
 
ecosystem.
 
 
The
 
role
 
for
 
an
 
organization
 
like
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
in
 
this
 
space
 
can
 
be
 
listed
 
as
 
follows

●
 
Sectoral
 
landscaping/benchmarking
 
-
 
Focus
 
on
 
studies
 
for
 
the
 
sector
 
as
 
a
 
whole,
 
where
 
knowledge
 
products
 
are
 
developed
 
that
 
have
 
potential
 
implications
 
on
 
the
 
entire
 
sector.
 
 
CEEW
 
could
 
elevate
 
its
 
branding
 
and
 
create
 
product-lines
 
through
 
publications
 
of
 
landscape
 
studies
 
and
 
provide
 
insights
 
on
 
the
 
sector
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
thematic
 
areas.
 
The
 
knowledge
 
gaps
 
for
 
investment
 
and
 
implementations
 
could
 
be
 
addressed
 
through
 
such
 
studies.
 
For
 
example,
 
CEEW
 
could
 
publish
 
the
 
sectoral
 
investment
 
opportunities
 
in
 
Electric
 
Mobility
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
3-

much
 
more.

Reporting
 
tools

frameworks
 
-
 
Designing
 
of
 
reporting
 
frameworks
 
and
 
tools
 
is
 
another
 
key
 
area
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
scope
 
for
 
The
 
Council.
 
As
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
with
 
the
 
climate
 
pledge
 
discussed
 
earlier,
 
measuring
 
and
 
reporting
 
greenhouse
 
gas
 
emissions
 
on
 
a
 
regular
 
basis
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
commitment
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
which
 
are
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
initiative.
 
 
CEEW
 
could
 
become
 
the
 
messenger
 
of
 
Sustainability
 
and
 
Climate
 
Change
 
reporting
 
for
 
India.
 
Besides
 
Business
 
Responsibility
 
Reporting,
 
India
 
hasn’t
 
come
 
up
 
with
 
reporting
 
frameworks
 
and
 
tools.
 
Many
 
organisations
 
are
 
grappling
 
with
 
the
 
difﬁculty
 
to
 
make
 
strategic
 
business
 
decisions
 
as
 
they
 
have
 
limited
 
knowledge
 
on
 
sustainability
 
and
 
climate
 
change
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
climate
 
change,
 
sustainability
 
and
 
risks
 
as
 
businesses
 
face.

Scaling
 
and
 
replication
 
-
 
Designing
 
strategies
 
and
 
approaches
 
for
 
scaling
 
and
 
replication
 
of
 
the
 
initiative
 
is
 
a
 
possible
 
area
 
where
 
The
 
Council
 
could
 
play
 
a
 
pivotal
 
role
 
in
 
guiding
 
transition
 
to
 
transformation.
 
 
 
Research
 
Consortiums
 
and
 
Platform
 
approach
 
In
 
this
 
approach,
 
we
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
potential
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
form
 
the
 
intellectual
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
sustainability
 
councils
 
and
 
key
 
research
 
consortiums.
 
The
 
core

of
 
the
 
consortiums,
 
membered
 
by

A
 
platform
 
driven
 
consortium
 
approach
 
has
 
been
 
pivotal
 
and
 
effective
 
where
 
the
 
core
 
team
 
 
from
 
the
 
consortium
 
creates
 
an
 
interactive
 
space
 
to
 
ﬂoat
 
new
 
ideas,
 
debate
 
underlying
 
issues,
 
and
 
publicize
 
their
 
policy

in
 
progress.
 
Key
 
research
 
outputs,
 
policy

could
 
be
 
key
 
assets
 
and
 
content
 
advocated
 
and

The
 
need
 
to
 
raise
 
extensive

could
 
be
 
addressed
 
by

driving

systems.
 
According
 
to
 
UKRI,
 
this
  
could
 
help
 
CEEW
  
to
 
increase
 
the
 
attractiveness
 
and
 
sustainability
 
of
 
careers
 
throughout
 
the
 
R&amp;D
 
workforce
 
–
 
not
 
just
 
for
 
researchers,
 
but
 
also
 
for
 
technicians,
 
innovators,
 
entrepreneurs
 
and
 
practitioners.
 
 
Developing

UKRI
 
approaches
 
the
 
following

They
 
want
 
to
 
become
 
the
 
most
 
sought
 
research
 
agency
 
in
 
the
 
country
 
to
 
drive

investments
 
and
 
research
 
and
 
developments
 
in
 
the
 
sustainable
 
development
 
and
 
climate

sector.
 
CEEW
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
the
 
consortium
 
playing
 
a
 
greater
 
role
 
among
 
think
 
tanks,
 
business
 
needs
 
and
 
academia
 
and
 
could
 
drive

and
 
thematic
 
areas
 
and
 
lead
 
the
 
climate
 
change
 
initiatives
 
from
 
research
 
to
 
action.
 
The
 
research
 
and
 
innovation
 
system
 
is
 
complex
 
and
 
multidimensional
 
and
 
UKRI
 
consider
 
them
 
as
 
stewards
 
of
 
the
 
system.
 
As
 
a
 
research
 
aggregation
 
platform,
 
UKRI
 
uses
 
the
 
levers
 
at
 
their
 
disposal
 
in
 
an
 
integrated
 
and
 
coordinated
 
way
 
to
 
support
 
a
 
diverse
 
portfolio
 
of
 
outstanding
 
research,
 
innovation,
 
and
 
the
 
people
 
and
 
infrastructure
 
needed
 
to
 
deliver
 
it;
 
This
 
model
 
would
 
drive
 
up
 
prosperity
 
across
 
CEEW,
 
in
 
driving
 
the
 
investments
 
to
 
implement
 
solutions
 
on

provide
 
and
 
support
 
efﬁcient,
 
effective
 
public

In
 
summary,
 
CEEW
 
would
 
apply
 
research
 
consortium
 
as
 
a
 
platform
 
to
 
raise
 
un-earmarked
 
funds
 
to
 
address
 
megaproblems
 
of
 
the
 
country
 
through
 
stimulation
 
of

The

driven
 
by
 
The

creates
 
a

that

the
 
focus
 
of
 
the

Focus
 
only
 
on
 
for
 
proﬁt
 
enterprises.
 
They
 
take
 
10-15
 
years
 
to
 
return
 
though,
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
programme
 
driven,
 
mission
 
driven
 
etc.
 
Cash
 
to
 
cash
 
cycle
 
is
 
important.
 
Only
 
difference
 
is
 
they
 
are
 
willing
 
to
 
wait
 
longer
 
rather
 
than
 
5-7
 
years
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
norm
 
in
 
PE.
 
Because
 
the
 
gestation
 
period
 
is
 
long.
 
Patient
 
capital
 
is
 
something
 
Aavishkar
 
is
 
willing
 
to
 
do.
 
Focus

SMEs
 
in
 
both
 
debt
 
and

No
 
such
 
focus,
 
they
 
leave
 
the
 
SMEs
 
to
 
self
 
regulate
 
as
 
the
 
buyers
 
demand
 
the
 
same.
  
Aavishkar
 
portfolio
 
is
 
not
 
more
 
than
 
20
 
companies,
 
spread
 
across
 
the
 
world.
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
looked
 
at
 
like
 
a
 
programme.
 
So
 
at
 
least
 
with
 
Aavishkar
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
fund
 
for
 
ESG
 
compliance,

etc.
 
 
Limited

the

No
 
research
 
focus
 
from
 
Aavishkar,
 
as
 
of
 
now
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
commissioned
 
any
 
studies.

of
 
clarity
 
in

of

of
 
this.
 
Not
 
thought
 
through
 
in

Implications
 
for
 
CEEW:
 
1)
 
PE
 
players
 
are
 
focused
 
on
 
ﬁnancial
 
returns,
 
while
 
some
 
offer
 
patient
 
capital
 
like
 
Aavishkar
 
majority
 
do
 
not.
 
They
 
are
 
not
 
mission
 
or
 
programme
 
driven,
 
Portfolio
 
sizes
 
are
 
very
 
small
 
hence
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
more
 
on
 
the
 
individual
 
companies
 
rather
 
than
 
at
 
the
 
portfolio
 
level.
 
Research
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
much
 
of
 
a
 
role
 
to
 
play
 
in
 
this
 
space
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
decision
 
making
 
or
 
compliances.
 
For
 
CEEWs
 
requirements
 
of
 
independent
 
funding
 
at
 
a
 
nexus
 
of
 
domains
 
these
 
proﬁle
 
of
 
funders
 
will
 
not
 
ﬁt
 
even
 
if
 
CEEW
 
decides
 
to
 
go
 
down
 
the
 
for-proﬁt
 
route
 
as
 
here
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
on
 
returns
 
albeit
 
with
 
patient
 
capital.

they
 
have
 
to

in
 
this,

Scale

the

in

there
 
are
 
maybe
 
better

make
 
more

Have
 
not
 
heard
 
about
 
them
 
in
 
the

so
 
not

what
 
they
 
offer,
 
what
 
is
 
their

for

Implications
 
for
 
CEEW:
 
Funding

less
 
on

-
 
Approaches

is
 
something
 
CEEW
 
can
 
do.
 
Innovations
 
in
 
these
 
domains
 
etc
 
is
 
something
 
I
 
would
 
look
 
at
 
them
 
for,
 
They
 
should
 
pick
 
and
 
choose
 
better,
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
known
 
for
 
and
 
what
 
should
 
people
 
come
 
to
 
them
 
for
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand.
 
Not
 
sure
 
what
 
exactly
 
they
 
are
 
known
 
for
 
in
 
this
 
space.
 
In
 
the
 
next
 
decade
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
clear
 
on
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
known
 
for.
 
ESG
 
ﬁnancing
 
is
 
a
 
scope
 
for
 
them
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
being
 
a
 
trusted
 
advisor
 
for
 
major
 
organizations
 
,
 
stakeholders
 
in
 
this
 
space.
 
Not
 
sure
 
where
 
exactly
 
they
 
can
 
ﬁt
 
in
 
but
 
WB,
 
ADB,
 
GIZ
  
etc
 
have
 
policy
 
related
 
funding
 
which
 
might
 
be
 
relevant
 
in

of

At
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
IIHS
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
their
 
competitor.
 
Maybe
 
looking
 
at
 
how
 
their
 
research
 
is
 
used
 
might
 
help
 
in
 
understanding
 
who
 
their
 
competitors
 
are.
 
Don't
 
see
 
them
 
much
 
from
 
a
 
sub-national
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
however
 
they
 
can
 
bridge
 
this
 
by
 
bringing
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
key
 
strategic
 
partners.

Great

with
 
what
 
organizations
 
like

do
 
-
 
Working
 
in
 
the

of
 
domins,
 
focus
 
on
 
multi
 
year
 
funding
 
with
 
being
 
open
 
to
 
early
 
stage
 
funding.
 
They
 
prefer
 
unrestricted
 
funding
 
as
 
well.
 
They
 
fund
 
people
 
they
 
trust,
 
they
 
believe
 
in,
 
which
 
ﬁts
 
in
 
very
 
well
 
with
 
what
 
CEEW
 
is
 
looking
 
for,
 
where
 
the
 
investments
 
are
 
on
 
the
 
people
 
rather
 
than
 
projects.
 
If
 
CEEWs
 
leadership
 
can
 
build
 
that
 
trust
 
with
 
them,
 
they
 
will
 
deﬁnitely

among
 
the

Prelude to the 
presentation 

Ethos of the perception study 
Principles and Approaches that govern this donor perception mapping study is enlisted. It is therefore critical to keep 
in mind that, 
• Data is highly qualitative and captures critical perceptions and sentiments 
• Governed by trust and anonymity - synthesis must reﬂect on donor’s truest contexts and perceptions without bias 
• Nature of interaction has been free ﬂowing, evolving with the expression of the donors (not all topics are covered 
for all donors) 
• Opinions and the intensity of perceptions cannot be quantiﬁed using a linear approach - A composite model of 
weightage has been utilised 
• Wherever appropriate and possible, donors have been quoted, highlighted and examples provided 
• Wherever appropriate and possible, we have adopted the principles of perception mapping by incorporating 
experiences and contexts provided by the donors 

How has CMS approached synthesis of perceptions 
• The sentiments and perceptions of donors have been processed without losing the essence of the donors expression 
• Eliminating any objective or conﬁrmation or information biases 
• CMS has collected and synthesised the perceptions controlling for the trust and anonymity 
• Hence, we have put in an effort to morph and represent the perceptions without disclosing the identity of the respondent or the 
donor 
• Ascertain weightage 
• Not just based on a number or percentage of donors saying X or Y 
• But by factoring; 
• Maturity of the relationship between the donor and The Council 
• Longevity of the partnership/relationship 
• Frequency and the intensity of the engagement - number of grants, the value of grants, nature of engagement 
• Sectoral positioning 
• Alignment to The Council’s vision 2030 

Study &amp; the Approach 

Objectives of the study 
The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) aims to commission a perception survey 
among the donor community — a key stakeholder for The Council — to understand its growth, 
impact, risks and vision for the future from their perspective. 
• Understanding Impact : Mapping CEEW's research, advisory and outreach — and the impact 
CEEW has had (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials. 
• Understanding Growth : Analysing perceptions around CEEW’s growth being organic, 
planned or strategic; areas where we have surpassed expectations and where potential 
remains not fully realised. 
• Understanding Visibility : Analysing CEEW’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, 
its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset. 
• Understanding Risks : Analysing how donors perceive CEEW’s governance as well as the 
risks that CEEW must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, 
external environment or strategic directions. 
• Understanding Demand : Assessing what donors want and ﬁnding points of synergy 
between the two approaches without compromising on CEEW’s well-earned independence 
• Understanding our value-proposition : Assessing perceptions on CEEW’s values and 
priorities, including being integrated in analysis, international/global in outlook, independent 
of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy. 
• Benchmarking CEEW against domestic and international competition 410+  seminars and

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
1. Human capital and research capabilities came out as being 
perceived as superior quality (both thematic and functional expertise) 
• Charismatic and entrepreneurial leadership perception  was the 
hallmark across the spectrum of donors 
• T eams and researchers are empowered with decentralised 
decision-making power , which assists the programmes and 
initiatives 
• Ability to conceive complex research hypotheses , strong 
analytical competencies, strengthening the research 
ecosystem 
Quote - The Council can be ranked as one of the top think tanks in the sector 
regarding its social capital, networking capabilities, and technical knowledge. Their 
researchers are part of the GOI steering and planning and policy committees, 
providing key inputs in policy making and implementation. 
• Expect to see a capacitated second line of business, and 
entrepreneurial leaders (50% of the donors) 
• Institutionalised approach to broad base engagement 
• Across the levels of the organisation, not restricted to the 
senior leadership only 2. Recognition as a refreshing think tank - A ﬁtting institution and 
an ecosystem fostering sector-shaping, futuristic research 
• Young, aggressive, pathﬁnder institution (40% of the 
donors) 
• Platform with scope for growth opportunities to 
well-qualiﬁed personnel 
• Revered for reputation, integrity, and ﬁnancial transparency 
• Potential for both the approaches 
• Becoming a global think tank leveraging the social and 
human capital 
• Strengthening the local &amp; sub-national partnerships, 
initiatives, and funding to becoming a pioneer within 
India (40% of the donors) 
Quote - Having a young and energetic team is The Council’s strength. Their 
teams have the capacity to ideate and innovate with the sectoral experts 
who are members of the Government committees and state-level 
authorities. They quite often pursue futuristic research. 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, 
convenings and collaboration with national governments 
•Networking, convenings and collaborations  with 
policymakers in the Central Government are superior 
strengths  (100% of the donors) 
•Spearheaded changes and policies at the national level 
(ex. National Hydrogen Mission, Cooling NCAP etc.) 
•Quality of networking and collaborations needs to be 
developed at the sub-national level to leverage 
opportunities and emerge as a pioneering local think 
tank (40% of the donors) 
Quote - As a leading voice in India’s climate and sustainability sector, The Council 
occupies a unique position and an opportunity to make a signiﬁcant difference. 
There are real and burning concerns around issues such as transition, and social 
responsibility, where The Council have the independence and the power to voice 
their opinion and ignite exciting deliberations. 3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, 
convenings and collaboration with national governments 
•Perceived proximity of the leadership to the 
government stakeholders - raising questions on 
“independence” (25% of the donors) 
•Improving the cohesion of collaborating with the peer 
institutions and competitive think tanks (4 donors) 
•Opportunity to attract collaborative driven 
funding and leverage funding for complex 
•Intersectional issues where the risks of failure or 
inaction are distributed across the collaborating 
partners 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products 
•High quality outputs, data visualisations and 
presentation for research ﬁndings  (80% of the donors) 
•Quality and quantity of research outputs in the 
format of papers, articles, and citations across markets 
and sectors were appreciated and numerous examples 
were cited  
•Seminars, conferences and the convening capacity  
perceived as outstanding 
•Relevance and engagement of stakeholders in each 
convening improved the quality of convenings 
Quote - The Council does possess good inroads with the sector's policy circle 
(government), and their research, report and data are credible and are widely 
accepted by the government and other stakeholders 4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products 
•A general sentiment has been that The Council claims 
attribution beyond the proportionate share when it 
comes to policy announcements by the Government, 
which dilutes the “independence” as a value (3 donors) 
Quote - The Council tries to project their contribution as attribution in many 
instances. One recent example would be during the COP-26 summit, when 
Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Net Zero 
Commitment and an action plan for the target year, 2070; The Council is one of 
the many claimants to claim how various pieces of their work in the sector, their 
contributions in the steering committees etc. have been directly responsible for 
India's stance. It came from their CEO’s handle. This approach is something The 
Council must reﬂect upon. Not every statement by the government and recent 
trend needs to be cross validated from their platforms and claimed credit. 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
5. Engagement strategy (referring to engagement with donors 
under initiatives or programmes)  is effective and has a lot of 
scope to strengthen further 
•Willingness to engage on a strategic/long-term 
partnership (100% donors) 
•Engagement and communication (programme or 
initiative level) have been well received 
•Autoﬁt/First choice  for donors who have a criterion 
for selection of grantees/partners. The Council 
perceived as one of the top think tanks to engage in 
the sector (capability, capacity and capital wise) 
Quote - The Council considers the donor's expectations and 
co-creates the design and strategy for the study. However, we have 
not encountered an instance where there is a compromise on the 
ﬁndings. The objectivity in research is of higher order to the 
expectations of the funding institution. 5. Engagement strategy is effective and has a lot of scope to 
strengthen further 
•A “felt need” for an effective communication strategy  
(4 donors) 
•Concurrent communication beyond the realms of 
the engaging programme (newsletters, SM 
engagement etc.) , 
•Engaging the communication team from the 
beginning is becoming necessary (effectiveness of 
events, coordination during key disseminations etc.) 
•Generally, is perceived to occupy an elitist positioning 
with communication and outreach - More engagement 
with the policy and members of the higher hierarchy 
and lesser focus on the vulnerable and affected groups 
Quote - Due to a lack of involvement in the project from the 
start, the communications team were not intimately familiar 
with the content. As a result, it became difﬁcult because their 
content felt disconnected and caused misalignment during the 
event. 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
•Ecosystem role playing - provision of thought 
leadership support to the funding institutions in 
terms of shaping up donor strategy to achieving the 
mission 
•Models for impact at scale  as in the powering 
livelihoods initiative 
•Evidence lever enabling donors strengthen ﬂagship  
programmes, and assisting in ideating towards 
emerging sectoral trends and gaps in the sector 
•Senior leadership able to uphold the quality of 
relationships as well as the outcomes (4 donors) 
•Awards and rankings  were not signiﬁcant elements 
that inﬂuenced  engagement (40% of the donors) 
•Potential to syndicate research, create research 
products  that can be taken to scale across the sector 
and funders 
•Good model and process of engagement in grant 
management; •Dr. Arunabha performs most heavy lifting  across 
partnerships, relationships, brand perception (50% of 
the donors) 
•Widen the current engagement levers  beyond 
evidence generation, policy formulation, advocacy, 
dissemination, and outreach. 
•Working actively with implementation organisations, 
CSOs/NGOs etc . to create implementation designs, 
demonstrations, model, and scale building 
•Researchers are fatigued in programmes  cause of 
many other involvements (2 donors) 
•Strengthen the talent acquisition process  to hire 
diverse competencies- Attract and retain talented 
human capital (3 donors) 
•Incorporating a dedicated grant management team   
&amp; Declutter the administrative process  in repeated 
engagements and known donors 

Cohort 1 - Way Forward 
• Nature of the think tank and the potential for growth 
• Great potential to expanding the great work globally 
• Deepening the nationals &amp; subnational work to being a 
sectoral pioneer locally 
• Dr Arunabha holds the key for entrepreneurial leadership capital  - 
the face of many relationships - diversifying the leadership 
capabilities 
• Pursue institutional development, capacity development, pursue

Ethos of the perception study 
Principles and Approaches that govern this donor perception mapping study is enlisted. It is therefore critical to keep 
in mind that, 
• Data is highly qualitative and captures critical perceptions and sentiments 
• Governed by trust and anonymity - synthesis must reﬂect on donor’s truest contexts and perceptions without bias 
• Nature of interaction has been free ﬂowing, evolving with the expression of the donors (not all topics are covered 
for all donors) 
• Opinions and the intensity of perceptions cannot be quantiﬁed using a linear approach - A composite model of 
weightage has been utilised 
• Wherever appropriate and possible, donors have been quoted, highlighted and examples provided 
• Wherever appropriate and possible, we have adopted the principles of perception mapping by incorporating 
experiences and contexts provided by the donors 

How has CMS approached synthesis of perceptions 
• The sentiments and perceptions of donors have been processed without losing the essence of the donors expression 
• Eliminating any objective or conﬁrmation or information biases 
• CMS has collected and synthesised the perceptions controlling for the trust and anonymity 
• Hence, we have put in an effort to morph and represent the perceptions without disclosing the identity of the respondent or the 
donor 
• Ascertain weightage 
• Not just based on a number or percentage of donors saying X or Y 
• But by factoring; 
• Maturity of the relationship between the donor and The Council 
• Longevity of the partnership/relationship 
• Frequency and the intensity of the engagement - number of grants, the value of grants, nature of engagement 
• Sectoral positioning 
• Alignment to The Council’s vision 2030 

Study &amp; the Approach 

Objectives of the study 
The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) aims to commission a perception survey 
among the donor community — a key stakeholder for The Council — to understand its growth, 
impact, risks and vision for the future from their perspective. 
• Understanding Impact : Mapping CEEW's research, advisory and outreach — and the impact 
CEEW has had (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials. 
• Understanding Growth : Analysing perceptions around CEEW’s growth being organic, 
planned or strategic; areas where we have surpassed expectations and where potential 
remains not fully realised. 
• Understanding Visibility : Analysing CEEW’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, 
its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset. 
• Understanding Risks : Analysing how donors perceive CEEW’s governance as well as the 
risks that CEEW must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, 
external environment or strategic directions. 
• Understanding Demand : Assessing what donors want and ﬁnding points of synergy 
between the two approaches without compromising on CEEW’s well-earned independence 
• Understanding our value-proposition : Assessing perceptions on CEEW’s values and 
priorities, including being integrated in analysis, international/global in outlook, independent 
of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy. 
• Benchmarking CEEW against domestic and international competition 410+  seminars and

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
1. Human capital and research capabilities came out as being 
perceived as superior quality (both thematic and functional expertise) 
• Charismatic and entrepreneurial leadership perception  was the 
hallmark across the spectrum of donors 
• T eams and researchers are empowered with decentralised 
decision-making power , which assists the programmes and 
initiatives 
• Ability to conceive complex research hypotheses , strong 
analytical competencies, strengthening the research 
ecosystem 
Quote - The Council can be ranked as one of the top think tanks in the sector 
regarding its social capital, networking capabilities, and technical knowledge. Their 
researchers are part of the GOI steering and planning and policy committees, 
providing key inputs in policy making and implementation. 
• Expect to see a capacitated second line of business, and 
entrepreneurial leaders (50% of the donors) 
• Institutionalised approach to broad base engagement 
• Across the levels of the organisation, not restricted to the 
senior leadership only 2. Recognition as a refreshing think tank - A ﬁtting institution and 
an ecosystem fostering sector-shaping, futuristic research 
• Young, aggressive, pathﬁnder institution (40% of the 
donors) 
• Platform with scope for growth opportunities to 
well-qualiﬁed personnel 
• Revered for reputation, integrity, and ﬁnancial transparency 
• Potential for both the approaches 
• Becoming a global think tank leveraging the social and 
human capital 
• Strengthening the local &amp; sub-national partnerships, 
initiatives, and funding to becoming a pioneer within 
India (40% of the donors) 
Quote - Having a young and energetic team is The Council’s strength. Their 
teams have the capacity to ideate and innovate with the sectoral experts 
who are members of the Government committees and state-level 
authorities. They quite often pursue futuristic research. 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, 
convenings and collaboration with national governments 
•Networking, convenings and collaborations  with 
policymakers in the Central Government are superior 
strengths  (100% of the donors) 
•Spearheaded changes and policies at the national level 
(ex. National Hydrogen Mission, Cooling NCAP etc.) 
•Quality of networking and collaborations needs to be 
developed at the sub-national level to leverage 
opportunities and emerge as a pioneering local think 
tank (40% of the donors) 
Quote - As a leading voice in India’s climate and sustainability sector, The Council 
occupies a unique position and an opportunity to make a signiﬁcant difference. 
There are real and burning concerns around issues such as transition, and social 
responsibility, where The Council have the independence and the power to voice 
their opinion and ignite exciting deliberations. 3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, 
convenings and collaboration with national governments 
•Perceived proximity of the leadership to the 
government stakeholders - raising questions on 
“independence” (25% of the donors) 
•Improving the cohesion of collaborating with the peer 
institutions and competitive think tanks (4 donors) 
•Opportunity to attract collaborative driven 
funding and leverage funding for complex 
•Intersectional issues where the risks of failure or 
inaction are distributed across the collaborating 
partners 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products 
•High quality outputs, data visualisations and 
presentation for research ﬁndings  (80% of the donors) 
•Quality and quantity of research outputs in the 
format of papers, articles, and citations across markets 
and sectors were appreciated and numerous examples 
were cited  
•Seminars, conferences and the convening capacity  
perceived as outstanding 
•Relevance and engagement of stakeholders in each 
convening improved the quality of convenings 
Quote - The Council does possess good inroads with the sector's policy circle 
(government), and their research, report and data are credible and are widely 
accepted by the government and other stakeholders 4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products 
•A general sentiment has been that The Council claims 
attribution beyond the proportionate share when it 
comes to policy announcements by the Government, 
which dilutes the “independence” as a value (3 donors) 
Quote - The Council tries to project their contribution as attribution in many 
instances. One recent example would be during the COP-26 summit, when 
Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Net Zero 
Commitment and an action plan for the target year, 2070; The Council is one of 
the many claimants to claim how various pieces of their work in the sector, their 
contributions in the steering committees etc. have been directly responsible for 
India's stance. It came from their CEO’s handle. This approach is something The 
Council must reﬂect upon. Not every statement by the government and recent 
trend needs to be cross validated from their platforms and claimed credit. 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
5. Engagement strategy (referring to engagement with donors 
under initiatives or programmes)  is effective and has a lot of 
scope to strengthen further 
•Willingness to engage on a strategic/long-term 
partnership (100% donors) 
•Engagement and communication (programme or 
initiative level) have been well received 
•Autoﬁt/First choice  for donors who have a criterion 
for selection of grantees/partners. The Council 
perceived as one of the top think tanks to engage in 
the sector (capability, capacity and capital wise) 
Quote - The Council considers the donor's expectations and 
co-creates the design and strategy for the study. However, we have 
not encountered an instance where there is a compromise on the 
ﬁndings. The objectivity in research is of higher order to the 
expectations of the funding institution. 5. Engagement strategy is effective and has a lot of scope to 
strengthen further 
•A “felt need” for an effective communication strategy  
(4 donors) 
•Concurrent communication beyond the realms of 
the engaging programme (newsletters, SM 
engagement etc.) , 
•Engaging the communication team from the 
beginning is becoming necessary (effectiveness of 
events, coordination during key disseminations etc.) 
•Generally, is perceived to occupy an elitist positioning 
with communication and outreach - More engagement 
with the policy and members of the higher hierarchy 
and lesser focus on the vulnerable and affected groups 
Quote - Due to a lack of involvement in the project from the 
start, the communications team were not intimately familiar 
with the content. As a result, it became difﬁcult because their 
content felt disconnected and caused misalignment during the 
event. 

Key synthesis from Cohort 1 
•Ecosystem role playing - provision of thought 
leadership support to the funding institutions in 
terms of shaping up donor strategy to achieving the 
mission 
•Models for impact at scale  as in the powering 
livelihoods initiative 
•Evidence lever enabling donors strengthen ﬂagship  
programmes, and assisting in ideating towards 
emerging sectoral trends and gaps in the sector 
•Senior leadership able to uphold the quality of 
relationships as well as the outcomes (4 donors) 
•Awards and rankings  were not signiﬁcant elements 
that inﬂuenced  engagement (40% of the donors) 
•Potential to syndicate research, create research 
products  that can be taken to scale across the sector 
and funders 
•Good model and process of engagement in grant 
management; •Dr. Arunabha performs most heavy lifting  across 
partnerships, relationships, brand perception (50% of 
the donors) 
•Widen the current engagement levers  beyond 
evidence generation, policy formulation, advocacy, 
dissemination, and outreach. 
•Working actively with implementation organisations, 
CSOs/NGOs etc . to create implementation designs, 
demonstrations, model, and scale building 
•Researchers are fatigued in programmes  cause of 
many other involvements (2 donors) 
•Strengthen the talent acquisition process  to hire 
diverse competencies- Attract and retain talented 
human capital (3 donors) 
•Incorporating a dedicated grant management team   
&amp; Declutter the administrative process  in repeated 
engagements and known donors 

Cohort 1 - Way Forward 
• Nature of the think tank and the potential for growth 
• Great potential to expanding the great work globally 
• Deepening the nationals &amp; subnational work to being a 
sectoral pioneer locally 
• Dr Arunabha holds the key for entrepreneurial leadership capital  - 
the face of many relationships - diversifying the leadership 
capabilities 
• Pursue institutional development, capacity development, pursue 
sectoral needs that are unfunded, invest in complex and 
intersectional research designs 
• Potential to syndicating research, creation of core research and 
knowledge products,  
• Incubate sustainable business models  that can be taken to scale 
across the sector and donor networks 
• Ecosystem role playing  - Thought leadership support to the funding 
institutions in terms of shaping up strategy to achieving the 
mission, ideating towards emerging sectoral trends and gaps; 
maximise and accelerate impact 
• Improve the cohesion of working with the peer institutions and 
competitive think tanks to attract collaborative driven funding 
and leverage funding  for complex and intersectional issues

Comments
 
on
 
the
 
TOR
 
This
 
is
 
our

for
 
collaborating
 
with
 
CIFF
 
-
 
“India
 
Low
 
Carbon
 
Agriculture:
 
For
 
Monitoring,
 
Learning
 
&amp;
 
Evaluation”
 
as
 
the
 
lead
 
Evaluation
 
Partner,
 
an
 
effective
 
and
 
sustainable
 
evaluation
 
culture,
 
system
 
and
 
process
 
by
 
championing
 
the
 
designing
 
of
 
the
 
M&amp;E
 
framework,
 
collecting
 
data
 
(qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative)
 
to
 
explore,
 
analyse,
 
interpret,
 
and
 
report
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
programme,
 
thereby
 
empowering
 
the
 
investment,
 
programme
 
and
 
to
 
help
 
the
 
MRV
 
and
 
implementing
 
partners
 
under
 
the
 
investment,
 
obtain
 
real
 
time
 
insights
 
and
 
learn
 
to
 
adapt
 
and
 
solve
 
in
 
the
 
emerging
 
contexts
 
and
 
dynamics
 
We
 
are
 
excited
 
and
 
would
 
welcome
 
the
 
opportunity
 
of
 
being
 
the
 
lead
 
Evaluation
 
Partner
 
with
 
CIFF
 
as
 
the
 
biggest
 
private
 
contributors
 
to
 
climate
 
mitigation
 
and
 
other
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
in
 
this
 
ambitious
 
but
 
critical
 
programme
 
with
 
a
 
strategic
 
priority,
 
and
 
the
 
objective
 
to
 
transform
 
the
 
land
 
use
 
and
 
the
 
integrated
 
food
 
systems.
 
With
 
an
 
intent
 
to
 
deliver
 
an
 
“Integrated
 
land
 
use
 
system
 
that
 
can
 
feed
 
10
 
Billion
 
people
 
by
 
2050”,
 
we
 
agree
 
that
 
the,
 
natural
 
carbon
 
sinks
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
protected
 
and
 
sustainably
 
managed,
 
natural
 
habitat
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
restored,
 
emissions
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
reduced
 
along-with
 
improvement
 
in
 
livelihoods
 
and
 
nutritional
 
value
 
through
 
better
 
production
 
of
 
agricultural
 
and
 
forestry
 
commodities
 
and
 
consumptions
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
shifted
 
towards
 
a
 
food
 
system
 
that
 
delivers
 
for
 
all
 
through
 
pragmatic
 
solutions
 
at
 
scale.
 
This
 
proposal
 
is
 
being
 
submitted
 
by
 
Catalyst
 
Management
 
Services
 
(CMS),
 
a
 
26-year
 
old
 
organisation
 
enabling
 
partners
 
to
 
leverage
 
the
 
strength
 
of
 
evidence
 
and
 
learning
 
to
 
bring
 
lasting
 
social
 
change.
 
We
 
have
 
structured
 
our
 
proposal
 
in
 
four
 
parts:
 
1.
 
We
 
start
 
with
 
articulating
 
our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
purpose,
 
approaches
 
and
 
key
 
essence
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
investment,
 
“Proof
 
of
 
Concept
 
(PoC)
 
-
 
India
 
Low
 
Carbon
 
Agriculture”
 
followed
 
by
 
highlighting
 
our
 
motivation,
 
experience
 
and
 
expertise
 
in
 
collaboration
 
as
 
the
 
lead
 
Evaluation
 
Partner
.
 
(2
 
pages)
 
2.
 
In
 
the
 
second
 
part,
 
the
 
core
 
technical
 
component,
 
a
 
brief
 
on
 
the
 
expectations,
 
objectives
 
and
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
programme
 
synthesising
 
our
 
understanding
 
is
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
lens
 
to
 
build
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
MLE
 
framework
 
and
 
approach
 
for
 
the
 
proposed
 
engagement,
 
its
 
relevance
 
and
 
signiﬁcance
 
leading
 
to
 
the
 
objectives
 
and
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation.
 
The
 
proposed
 
framework
 
encompasses
 
multiple
 
approaches
 
to
 
effectively
 
achieve
 
the
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation,
 
and
 
correspondingly
 
the
 
source
 
of
 
data,
 
sampling
 
approaches,
 
key
 
outputs,
 
timelines
 
and
 
milestones
 
of
 
the
 
engagement
 
are
 
highlighted.
 
The
 
institutional
 
arrangements
 
between
 
CMS,
 
CIFF,
 
MRV
 
and
 
implementation
 
partners
 
to
 
effectively
 
steer
 
and
 
implement
 
this
 
process
 
is
  
highlighted
 
here.
 
(5
 
pages)
 
3.
 
The
 
third
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
proposal
 
highlights
 
the
 
key
 
attitudes
 
and
 
capacities
 
that
 
are
 
required
 
amongst
 
the
 
team
 
members
 
to
 
enable
 
an
 
effective
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
study.
 
In
 
this
 
context,
 
we
 
share
 
the
 
proposed
 
team
 
structure,
 
key
 
members,
 
their
 
expertise
 
and
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
engagement
 
at
 
various
 
stages
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
.
 
We
 
also
 
highlight
 
here
 
our
 
relevant
 
demonstrated
 
experiences
 
and
 
explanation
 
of
 
how
 
the
 
proposed
 
approaches
 
were
 
used
 
in
 
a
 
similar
 
context
 
to
 
the
 
proposed
 
study
 
objectives
 
and
 
scope.
 
A
 
detailed
 
list
 
of
 
work
 
and
 
capacity
 
statements
 
of
 
the
 
CMS
 
and
 
the

is
 
annexed
 
to
 
provide
 
more
 
information,
 
along

fourth
 
and
 
ﬁnal
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
proposal

Our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
PoC
 
Investment
 
and
 
the
 
evaluation
 
needs
 
As
 
evaluation
 
partners,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
program
 
as
 
a
 
whole
 
and
 
its
 
key
 
essence,
 
uniqueness,
 
implementation
 
approaches
 
and
 
the
 
context
 
in
 
which
 
the
 
PoC
 
is
 
situated.
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
ToR
 
shared
 
with
 
us
 
and
 
our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
work,
 
we
 
have
 
brought
 
together
 
the
 
following
 
‘
Program
 
Intentional
 
Design
 
and
 
Approach
’
 
summarising

is
 
a

where
 
holistic

well-orchestrated
 
partnerships

investments
 
create
 
impact
 
that
 
is
 
transformational
 
in
 
driving
 
sustainable
 
and
 
scalable
 
equity.
 
We
 
at
 
CMS
 
believe
 
strongly
 
in
 
partnering
 
as
 
‘learning
 
facilitators’
 
to
 
co-learn
 
and
 
shape
 
outcomes
 
for
 
partners
 
in
 
the

We

to

effectively.
 
While
 
we
 
undertake
 
and
 
have
 
expertise
 
in
 
various
 
types
 
of
 
evaluations,
 
we
 
believe
 
and
 
demonstrate

and
 
investment

and
 
approaches
 
in

and
 
value

Our
 
ambition
 
as
 
an
 
organisation
 
is
 
to
 
contribute
 
to
 
impact,
 
scale
 
and
 
sustainability.
 
We
 
achieve
 
this
 
by
 
partnering
 
with
 
large
 
scale/deep
 
change
 
makers
 
(in
 
this
 
context,
 
AKRSP(I),
 
AKF,
 
FES,
 
WASSAN
 
and
 
Vetriver
)
 
and
 
the
 
investors
 
(in
 
this
 
context
 
CIFF
),
 
enabling
 
them
 
to
 
succeed
 
through
 
our
 
capabilities
 
of
 
evaluation
 
partnerships.
 
To
 
this
 
end,
 
deepening
 
our
 
work
 
with
 
CIFF
 
is
 
a
 
strategic
 
proposition
 
for
 
us.
 
CIFF
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
pivotal
 
partnership
 
in
 
nurturing
 
our
 
degree
 
of
 
association
 
with
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
SDGs
 
since
 
2019.

We
 
believe

it
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
CMS
 
as
 
a
 
learning

draws
 
on
 
insights
 
about
 
complex
 
dynamic
 
systems,
 
uncertainty,

and

and
 
how
 
this
 
could
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
purposes:
 
ongoing
 
program
 
development,
 
adapting
 
effective
 
principles
 
of
 
practice
 
to
 
local
 
contexts,
 
generating
 
innovations
 
and
 
taking
 
them
 
to
 
scale,
 
and
 
facilitating
 
rapid
 
response
 
in
 
difﬁcult
 
situations.

CMS
 
is
 
part
 
of
 
Catalyst
 
Group
 
of
 
Institutions,
 
which
 
includes
 
Vrutti
 
(i.e.,
 
a

organisation),
 
Swasti
 
(i.e.,

and
 
Genetic

and
 
Nutrition
 
Foundation
 
(GREEN
 
Foundation),
 
which
 
focuses
 
on
 
regenerative
 
agroecological
 
practices.
 
GREEN
 
Foundation
 
has
 
pioneered
 
agro-biodiversity
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
country.
 
It
 
has
 
worked

with
 
women
 
farmers
 
to
 
develop
 
models
 
of
 
in-situ
 
and
 
ex-situ

using
 
agro-ecological
 
practices,
 
promoting
 
Farmer
 
Producer
 
Organisations
 
and
 
linking
 
farmers’
 
products
 
to
 
the
 
market.
 
GREEN
 
Foundation
 
works
 
as
 
a
 
social
 
lab
 
for
 
CMS
 
and
 
currently
 
a
 
model
 
of
 
regenerative
 
agriculture
 
is
 
being
 
piloted
 
in
 
ﬁve
 
locations
 
in
 
Karnataka,
 
Tamil
 
Nadu,
 
Madhya
 
Pradesh
 
and
 
Chhattisgarh.
 
Hence,
 
our
 
understanding
 
of
 
LCA
 
is
 
deep
 
as
 
we
 
practice
 
it
 
ourselves.
 
As
 
practitioners,
 
we
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
be
 
part
 
of
 
LCA
 
models
 
being
 
implemented
 
to
 
bring
 
in
 
system-wide
 
change
 
at
 
a
 
scale
 
and
 
contribute
 
towards
 
shaping
 
the
 
same.
 
We
 
see
 
tremendous
 
opportunity
 
for
 
cross-learning
  
and
 
developing
 
knowledge
 
products
 
from
 
this
 
engagement.

during
 
the

of
 
October
 
2021
 
to

.
 
The
 
objectives
 
and
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation
 
partner
 
are
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
in
 
the
 
ToR,
 
therefore
 
we
 
have
 
proposed
 
the
 
MLE
 
Framework
,
 
Analytical
 
Framework
 
and
 
the
 
Deliverables
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
corresponding
 
expectations.
 
As
 
an
 
established
 
evaluation
 
partner
 
in
 
the
 
sector,
 
it
 
is
 
at
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
CMSs’
 
belief
 
that
 
to
 
have
 
an
 
effective
 
evaluation
 
and
 
the
 
investment
 
sustenance,
 
co-developing
 
the
 
design
 
and
 
embedding
 
the
 
evaluation
 
effectively
 
with
 
the
 
programme
 
is
 
essential.
 
Hence
 
we
 
emphasise
 
on
 
a
 
longer
 
term
 
partnership
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
being
 
effective,
 
and
 
the
 
deliverables
 
of
 
the

agreed
 
on
 
during

ToC
 
and
 
Causal
 
Pathways
 
The
 
current
 
ToC
 
as
 
depicted
 
in
 
the
 
Terms
 
of
 
Reference,
 
is
 
an
 
action
 
based
 
ToC,
 
which
 
envisages
 
outcomes
 
at
 
farmer,
 
government
 
and
 
market
 
level.
 
The
 
investments
 
and
 
actions
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level
 
leading
 
to
 
outcomes
 
at
 
farmer
 
level
 
are
 
clear
 
and
 
logical.
 
But,
 
the
 
investments
 
and
 
actions
 
at
 
government
 
and
 
market
 
level
 
are
 
not
 
speciﬁed.
 
Whether
 
the
 
programme
 
intends
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
and
 
inﬂuence
 
government
 
and
 
market
 
directly
 
or
 
the
 
changes
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
lead
 
to
 
changes
 
at
 
government
 
and
 
market
 
level
 
as
 
outcomes,
 
are
 
unclear.
 
How
 
and
 
why
 
the
 
government
 
will
 
bring
 
LCA
 
supportive
 
policies
 
or
 
bring
 
changes
 
to
 
MSP
 
of
 
LCA
 
crops?
 
Why
 
will
 
the
 
market
 
bring
 
in
 
LCA
 
supportive
 
procurement
 
rules
 
and
 
prioritise
 
LCA
 
crops?
 
The
 
causal
 
ToC
 
for
 
the
 
programme
 
is
 
missing.
 
It
 
is
 
critical
 
from
 
an
 
MEL
 
perspective
 
to
 
answer
 
these
 
questions
 
and
 
understand
 
the
 
causality
 
envisaged
 
for
 
the
 
programme,
 
including
 
assumptions
 
and
 
risks.

In

one
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
questions
 
the

is

is
 
understanding
 
the

the

that
 
the

or
 
the
 
project
 
has
 
made
 
towards
 
the
 
observed

or
 
in
 
the

In
 
the
 
cohort
 
study
 
proposed,
 
the
  
attribution
 
is
 
analysed
 
using
 
an
 
econometric
 
design,
 
but
 
the
 
intention
 
of
 
the
 
complementary
 
design
 
is
 
to
 
augment
 
the
 
gaps
 
and
 
limitations
 
of
 
the
 
experimental
 
or
 
quasi-experimental
 
design,
 
such
 
as

may
 
not
 
be
 
as

but
 
will
 
provide
 
some

(CS)
 
 
A
 
quasi-experimental
 
mixed
 
method
 
approach
 
is
 
proposed
 
for
 
the
 
cohort
 
study
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
the
 
key
 
target
 
population,
 
in
 
this
 
context
 
with
 
the
 
farmer
 
across
 
UP,
 
Gujarat
 
and
 
MP
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
implementation
 
partner
 
AKF
 
&amp;
 
AKRSP(I)
  
to
 
compare
 
outcomes
 
between
 
two
 
cohorts
 
of
 
farmers
 
–
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
been
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
PoC
 
Investment
 
(i.e.,
 
the
 
treatment
 
group)
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
enrolled
 
or
 
beneﬁtted
 
as
 
a
 
resultant
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
investment
 
(i.e.,
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
),
 
in
 
order
 
to

accruing
 
from
 
the
 
current

The
 
overall
 
methodology
 
will
 
entail
 
a
 
pre-post
 
comparison
 
of
 
key
 
outcomes
 
through
 
Baseline
 
(October

establish
 
the

of
 
the
 
treatment
 
effects
 
to
 
the
 
PoC

The

proposed
 
would
 
overlay
 
on
 
the
 
proposed
 
TOC
 
and
 
causal
 
pathways
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
evaluation
 
outcomes
 
and
 
the
 
baseline
 
data
 
collection
 
will
 
provide
 
the
 
basis
 
for
 
subsequent
 
assessment
 
of
 
how
 
efﬁciently
 
and
 
effectively
 
the
 
activities
 
are
 
being
 
implemented
 
and
 
the
 
eventual
 
results
 
achieved.
 
 
Primary
 
data
 
collection
 
is
 
proposed
 
to
 
be
 
at
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
this

and
 
will
 
include
 
extensive
 
data
 
collection
 
through
 
ﬁeld

with
 
the
 
objective
 
of

The

Given
 
the
 
integration
 
of
 
outputs
 
from
 
various
 
methods
 
in
 
the
 
MLE
 
framework,
 
the

be
 
adept
 
in

As

The

Evaluation
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
rationale
 
for
 
the
 
proposition
 
 
As
 
mentioned
 
earlier
 
we
 
use
 
multiplicity
 
of
 
approaches
 
which
 
are
 
Contribution
 
tracing,
 
outcome
 
mapping,
 
contribution
 
analysis
 
and
 
conventional
 
mixed
 
method
 
quasi-experimental
 
design
 
for
 
the
 
longitudinal
 
study,
 
the
 
evaluation
 
would
 
generate
 
a
 
robust
 
set
 
of
 
evidence
 
which
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
evaluate
 
outcomes
 
at
 
various
 
levels.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
kept
 
at
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
strategy
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation.
 
The
 
advisory
 
panel
 
has
 
been
 
constituted
 
keeping
 
in
 
mind
 
the
 
different
 
approaches
 
we
 
have
 
proposed
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation,
 
three
 
experts
 
across
 
the
 
domains
 
of
 
LCA,
 
agriculture
 
and
 
MLE
 
with
 
combined
 
experience
 
of
 
over
 
60
 
years
 
have
 
been
 
identiﬁed
 
for
 
the
 
engagement.
 
 
Each
 
approach
 
proposed
 
has
 
a
 
dedicated
 
team
 
lead
 
by
 
an
 
expert
 
who
 
has
 
over
 
5
 
years
 
of
 
experience
 
in
 
the
 
said
 
approach.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
teams
 
are
 
led
 
by
 
Mr.
 
Sivaramakrishnan
 
Balasubramanian
 
who
 
has
 
over
 
10
 
years
 
of
 
extensive
 
experience
 
in
 
leading
 
large
 
scale
 
evaluations
 
across
 
diverse
 
approaches
 
and
 
geographies.
 
The
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
chosen
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
their
 
abilities
 
to
 
collaborate
 
and
 
co-create
 
with
 
the

Financial
 
Proposal
 
From
 
CMSs’
 
past
 
experiences,
 
the
 
approach
 
to
 
budgeting
 
an
 
concurrent,
 
integrated
 
evaluation
 
such
 
as
 
this
 
is
 
most
 
often
 
complex,
 
evolving
 
and
 
resource
 
driven.
 
Understanding
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
study,
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
partnerships
 
involved,
 
extending
 
geography,
 
we
 
have
 
created
 
a
 
budgeting
 
logic
 
for
 
the
 
critical
 
costheaders,
 
resource
 
requirements
 
with
 
a
 
revolving
 
scope
 
for
 
absorbing
 
any
 
evolution
 
in
 
the
 
system
 
as
 
we
 
progress
 
over
 
the
 
year
 
with
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
valid
 
assumptions.
 
The
 
largest
 
component
 
of
 
the
 
budget
 
proposition
 
is
 
centered
 
towards
 
the
 
professional
 
fees
 
for
 
the
 
resources
 
(Evaluation
 
Team,
 
LMS
 
and
 
MRV
 
interfacing
 
teams)
 
as
 
the
 
evaluation
 
is
 
driven
 
by
 
the
 
competencies
 
and
 
inputs
 
of
 
the
 
team.
 
To
 
overlay
 
the
 
domain
 
(LCA
 
and
 
agro-climatic
 
expertise)
 
expertise
 
to
 
the
 
evaluation,
 
we
 
have
 
proposed
 
3
 
experts
 
in
 
the
 
advisory
 
capacity
 
and
 
their
 
costing
 
has
 
been
 
embedded.
 
 
To
 
support
 
data
 
being
 
collected
 
by
 
our
 
internal
 
set
 
of
 
enumerators
 
and
 
moderators
 
from
 
the
 
community
 
engagement
 
team
 
across
 
geographies
 
in
 
India
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
evidence
 
generation,
 
a
 
ﬁeld
 
budget
 
component
 
is
 
accounted
 
for.
 
An
 
inhouse
 
communications
 
expert
 
would
 
be
 
utilised
 
for
 
designing
 
reports,
 
presentations
 
or
 
audio/visual
 
briefs
 
to
 
CIFF
 
and
 
its
 
partners
 
and
 
the
 
costs
 
associated
 
with
 
dissemination
 
is
 
budgeted
 
as
 
a
 
separate
 
header.
 
Overall,
 
the
 
summary
 
of
 
the
 
budget
 
proposed
 
inclusive
 
of
 
in-direct
 
costs
 
@10%
 
of
 
the
 
gross
 
sum,
 
and
 
the
 
grand
 
total
 
of
 
budget
 
proposed
 
accounts
 
to
 
$338,481/
-.
 
The
 
exclusive
 
component
 
of
 
Taxes,
 
i.e.,
 
GST
 
is
 
not
 
applicable
 
if
 
the
 
consumption
 
of
 
services
 
is
 
outside
 
of
 
the
 
country.
 
If
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
service
 
outputs
 
are
 
consumed
 
by
 
the
 
contracting
 
agency/partners
 
within
 
India,
 
a
 
standard
 
18%
 
GST
 
would
 
be
 
applicable
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
budget
 
proposed.
 
Upon
 
clarity,
 
this
 
component
 
could
 
be
 
discussed
 
at
 
the
 
contracting
 
stage.

Partners
 
with

may
 
perceive

Use
 
of
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
:
 
Partners’
 
capacities
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
built
 
and
 
MLE
 
systems
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
reﬁned
 
to
 
enable
 
better
 
assimilation
 
and
 
application
 
of
 
the
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change.
 
Theory

Integrating
 
programmatic
 
categories
 
in
 
the
 
TOC-based
 
results
 
frameworks
 
for
 
Power

Clean
 
Air-
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
programmatic
 
work
 
streams
 
in
 
the
 
cooling
 
results
 
framework-
 
may
 
be
 
a
 
useful
 
step
 
in
 
this
 
direction.
 
A
 
broad
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
leads
 
to
 
weak
 
causal
 
chains,
 
affecting
 
CIFF’s
 
ability
 
to
 
assess
 
outcomes
 
and
 
see
 
the
 
needle
 
move.
 
We
 
have
 
to
 
proceed
 
with
 
the
 
cogninance
 
that
 
an
 
outcome
 
at
 
CIFF
 
investment
 
level
 
may
 
sometimes
 
be
 
just
 
a
 
much
 
needed
 
input/activity/output
 
at
 
a
 
sectoral
 
level.
 
 
●
 
Outcome
 
Measurement
:
 
While
 
CIFF
 
expects
 
outcome
 
level
 
reporting,
 
many
 
partners
 
still
 
report
 
on
 
an
 
output
 
level
 
into
 
the
 
MIS.
 
Partners
 
are
 
more
 
used
 
to
 
determining
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impact
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
larger
 
interventions
 
as
 
opposed
 
to
 
each
 
of
 
their
 
micro-outputs.
 
This
 
elucidates
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
either
 
building
 
partners’
 
capacities
 
to
 
assess
 
outcomes
 
of
 
each
 
output
 
or
 
modifying
 
the
 
system
 
to
 
better
 
support
 
partners’
 
outcomes
 
capture.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
function
 
also
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
strengthened
 
to
 
help
 
CIFF
 
better
 
identify
 
its
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impact.
 
 
●
 
Transparency
 
and
 
Ownership
:
 
Visibility
 
to
 
expectations
 
around
 
all
 
CIFF-related
 
MLE
 
processes
 
and
 
corresponding
 
results
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
partners
 
to
 
deliver
 
consistently.
 
Creating
 
more
 
data
 
transparency
 
and
 
sharing
 
key
 
MLE
 
insights
 
at
 
a
 
programme
 
level
 
can
 
help
 
promote
 
a
 
greater
 
sense
 
of
 
ownership
 
towards
 
MLE
 
processes
 
among
 
partners.
 
 
●
 
Use
 
of
 
Partners’
 
Meets
:
 
Partners’
 
meets
 
typically
 
have
 
a
 
disproportionate
 
focus
 
on
 
progress
 
updates
 
and
 
little
 
space
 
for
 
collaborative
 
reﬂections.
 
CIFF
 
has
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
evolve
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
partners’
 
meets
 
to
 
encourage
 
deep,
 
sectoral
 
reﬂection,
 
promote
 
constructive
 
dialogue
 
and
 
generate
 
knowledge
 
that
 
could
 
improve
 
partners’
 
approach
 
and
 
collaboration.
 
Programmatic
 
reﬂections
 
must
 
be
 
informed
 
by
 
data
 
from
 
dashboards
 
and
 
partners’
 
MIS
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
incentivize
 
partners
 
to
 
provide
 
quality-assured
 
inputs
 
to
 
the
 
MIS.
 
It
 
will
 
therefore
 
be
 
important
 
to
 
use
 
an
 
MLE
 
prescribed
 
reﬂection
 
timeline
 
moving
 
forward.
 
 
●
 
Synthesis
 
and
 
Stories
:
 
While
 
CIFF
 
has
 
the
 
intention
 
and
 
takes
 
action
 
to
 
complete
 
design
 
at
 
a
 
sectoral
 
level,
 
there
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
strengthen
 
sectoral
 
level
 
synthesis
 
by
 
collating
 
sectoral
 
knowledge
 
across
 
partners.
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
strengthen
 
qualitative
 
case
 
study
 
capture
 
and
 
stories
 
of
 
change
 
across
 
institutions.

of
 
smallholder
 
agricultural
 
households
 
in
 
an
 
accelerated

Owing
 
to
 
the
 
inclusion
 
of
 
a
 
comparative
 
group
 
for
 
the

CMS
 
proposes
 
cluster
 
randomisation
 
approach
 
adopted
 
for
 
the
 
continuous
 
primary
 
end-point
 
sampling
 
design.
 
Adopting
 
from
 
the
 
KPIs,
 
continuous
 
variables
 
like,

The

is
 
designed
 
to

accrued
 
by

However,
 
since
 
the

logics
 
are
 
not

we

the

randomisation
 
as
 
a

Main
 
areas
 
of
 
focus,
 
core
 
business
 
and
 
range
 
of
 
clients
 
Poverty
 
and
 
inequality
 
have
 
been
 
growing
 
worldwide.
 
While
 
many
 
organisations
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
poor
 
and
 
marginalised
 
communities
 
to
 
bring
 
about
 
change,
 
their
 
efﬁciency,
 
scale,
 
and
 
effectiveness
 
is
 
limited
 
by
 
underleveraged
 
social
 
and
 
management
 
aspects.
 
Community-focused
 
solutions
 
that
 
are
 
dynamic
 
in
 
design
 
and
 
work
 
at
 
scale
 
are
 
needed
 
to
 
address
 
socio-economic
 
and
 
environmental
 
challenges.
 
We
 
are
 
driven
 
by
 
the
 
challenge
 
of
 
ﬁnding
 
innovative
 
and
 
scalable
 
solutions
 
for
 
problems
 
in
 
development.
 
We
 
operate
 
at
 
the
 
threshold
 
of
 
knowledge
 
and
 
learning,
 
constantly
 
looking
 
for
 
opportunities
 
to
 
leverage
 
that
 
which
 
works,
 
cross-pollinate
 
ideas
 
across
 
sectors,
 
and
 
create
 
and
 
execute
 
new
 
models
 
for
 
new
 
challenges.
 
We
 
are
 
deeply
 
committed
 
to
 
communities
 
which
 
are
 
disadvantaged
 
and
 
work
 
towards
 
results
 
for
 
them
 
while
 
promoting
 
human
 
values,
 
gender
 
equity
 
and
 
overall
 
development.
 
We
 
directly
 
incubate
 
and
 
support
 
ideas,
 
organisations
 
and
 
leaders
 
for
 
a
 
long
 
period
 
of
 
time,
 
sometimes
 
well
 
over
 
a
 
decade,
 
leading
 
to
 
exponential
 
development
 
results.
 
Some
 
of
 
our
 
synergistic
 
engagements
 
have
 
resulted
 
in
 
development
 
laboratories
 
where
 
our
 
staff
 
converses
 
directly
 
with
 
communities
 
to
 
shape
 
their
 
thinking
 
and
 
skills.
 
 
What
 
kinds
 
of
 
ideas?
 
We
 
incubate
 
ideas
 
till
 
they
 
become
 
realistic
 
development
 
solutions,
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
concepts,
 
products,
 
models
 
and
 
approaches.

Two
 
prominent
 
examples
 
are
 
the
 
3-fold
 
model
 
(to
 
build
 
wealthy,
 
resilient,
 
and
 
responsible
 
farmers),
 
and
 
the
 
i4we
 
model
 
(an
 
exponential
 
primary
 
health
 
care
 
model).
  
We
 
have
 
incubated
 
more
 
than
 
25
 
such
 
ideas
 
which
 
have
 
impacted
 
farmers,
 
rural
 
poor,
 
sex
 
workers,
 
women
 
owned
 
businesses,
 
factory
 
workers,
 
bullock
 
cart
 
workers,
 
milk
 
vendors,
 
etc.
 
What
 
kind
 
of
 
institutions?
 
We
 
support
 
and
 
promote
 
community-based
 
organisations
 
(like
 
ﬁsherfolk,
 
sex
 
workers,
 
farmers),
 
NGOs
 
(those
 
into
 
service
 
delivery,
 
policy
 
formulation),
 
micro-ﬁnance
 
institutions,
 
producer
 
companies
 
and
 
cooperatives.
 
Some
 
of
 
our
 
incubated
 
ideas
 
have
 
become
 
full-ﬂedged
 
organisations
 
–
 
like
 
Swasti
 
Health
 
Catalyst,
 
Vrutti
 
Livelihood
 
Impact
 
Partners
 
and
 
Fuzhio
 
Health
 
and
 
Business
 
Services
 
Pvt.
 
Limited.
 
which
 
operate
 
as
 
our
 
sister
 
organisations
 
but
 
have
 
grown
 
to
 
be
 
signiﬁcant
 
development
 
players
 
in
 
their
 
own
 
right.
 
What
 
kinds
 
of
 
leaders?
 
Our
 
leaders
 
are
 
people
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
sector,
 
and
 
who
 
lead
 
programmes,
 
organisations
 
and
 
networks.
 
They
 
range
 
from
 
community
 
leaders
 
to
 
those
 
with
 
NGOs,
 
government
 
departments,
 
and
 
corporate
 
foundations.
 
Some
 
of
 
these
 
leaders
 
work
 
inside
 
CMS
 
(and
 
the
 
Catalyst
 
group)
 
and
 
some
 
work
 
outside
 
(alumni,
 
clients
 
and
 
partners).
 
Though
 
informal,
 
the
 
combined
 
leadership
 
support
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
mentoring,
 
coaching,
 
counselling
 
and
 
capacity
 
development
  
have
 
delivered
 
signiﬁcant
 
results.
 
How
 
have
 
we
 
helped
 
transform?
 
We
 
directly
 
and
 
indirectly
 
contribute
 
to
 
signiﬁcant
 
development
 
outcomes,
 
which
 
are
 
often
 
independently
 
assessed.
 
With
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
committed,
 
conﬁdent,
 
capacitate
 
and
 
result-oriented
 
leaders
 
we
 
have:
 
●
 
Improved
 
scale
 
and
 
reach
 
●
 
Accelerated
 
impact
 
●
 
Enhanced
 
viability
 
●
 
Raised
 
funds
 
●
 
Facilitated
 
control
 
and
 
ensured
 
independence
 
(over
 
agenda,
 
resources
 
–
 
for
 
community
 
organisations)
 
●
 
Improved
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
effectiveness
 
●
 
Ensured

India
 
including
 
locations
 
that
 
are
 
geographically
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
access.
 
 
Apart
 
from
 
India,
 
we

Executive
 
Summary
 
The
 
Council
 
on
 
Energy,
 
Environment
 
and
 
Water
 
(The
 
Council)
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
Asia’s
 
leading
 
not-for-proﬁt
 
policy
 
research
 
institutions.
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
emerged
 
as
 
a
 
leading
 
sectoral
 
think
 
tank
 
in
 
data,
 
integrated
 
analysis,
 
and
 
strategic
 
outreach
 
to
 
mitigate,
 
adapt
 
and
 
accelerate
 
climate
 
action
 
and
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
natural
 
resources.
 
 
The
 
founding
 
board
 
envisions
 
The
 
Council
 
as
 
an
 
India-based,
 
globally
 
engaged
 
policy
 
research
 
organisation.
 
The
 
think
 
tank
 
would
 
analyse
 
and
 
advise
 
on
 
critical
 
questions
 
on
 
energy,
 
environment,
 
and
 
water
 
as
 
inter-connected
 
concerns.
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
set
 
up
 
in
 
2010
 
to
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
platform
 
for
 
people
 
with
 
different
 
skills
 
to
 
come
 
together,
 
pursue
 
their
 
interests
 
and
 
build
 
careers
 
in
 
public
 
policy.
 
4.1
 
The
 
Council’s
 
Vision
 
2030
 
Having
 
completed
 
a
 
decade
 
of
 
their
 
existence
 
as
 
a
 
new-age
 
public
 
policy
 
think
 
tank,
 
the
 
study
 
endeavours
 
to
 
reﬂect
 
on
 
the
 
achievements
 
of
 
the
 
past
 
decade
 
from
 
the
 
perspective
 
of
 
the
 
existing
 
donors.
 
The
 
study
 
takes
 
a
 
deep
 
dive
 
into
 
the
 
areas
 
where
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
worked
 
effectively,
 
developing
 
and
 
analysing
 
the
 
resources,
 
capabilities
 
and
 
competencies
 
developed
 
so
 
far
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
streamline
 
the
 
direction
 
forward.
 
The
 
factors
 
enabling
 
growth
 
are
 
highly
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
changing
 
dynamics
 
of
 
a
 
world
 
being
 
threatened
 
by
 
climate-induced
 
extreme
 
events
 
and
 
anthropogenic
 
environmental
 
degradation
 
with
 
second-order
 
consequences.
 
The
 
achievement
 
of
 
SDG
 
13
 
(combat
 
climate
 
change
 
and
 
its
 
impacts)
 
is
 
inextricably
 
linked
 
to
 
other
 
SDGs,
 
i.e.,
  
 
●
 
SDG
 
6
 
(access
 
to
 
water
 
and
 
sanitation
 
for
 
all),
 
 
●
 
SDG
 
7
 
(access
 
to
 
affordable,
 
dependable,
 
sustainable,
 
and
 
modern
 
energy),
 
 
●
 
SDG
 
11
 
(Make
 
cities
 
inclusive,
 
safe,
 
resilient,
 
and
 
sustainable),
 
 
●
 
SDG
 
12
 
(Ensure
 
sustainable
 
consumption
 
and
 
production
 
patterns)
 
and
 
 
●
 
SDG
 
15
 
(Sustainably
 
manage
 
forests,
 
combat
 
desertiﬁcation,
 
halt
 
and
 
reverse
 
land
 
degradation,
 
halt
 
biodiversity
 
loss),
 
 
The
 
domains
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
currently
 
working
 
on,
 
aspire
 
to
 
intensify
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
decade
 
and
 
beyond.
 
 
4.2
 
Incorporating
 
key
 
stakeholder
 
perspectives
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
partnered
 
with
 
CMS
 
(Catalyst
 
Management
 
Services
 
Private
 
Limited)
 
to
 
conduct
 
a
 
study
 
which
 
aims
 
to
 
assess
 
and
 
explore
 
how
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
perceived
 
by
 
its
 
donors
 
and
 
potential
 
donors
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
 
This
 
study
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
inputs
 
towards
 
The
 
Council’s
 
Vision
 
2030
 
exercise,
 
understanding
 
and
 
aligning
 
their
 
core
 
values,
 
mission
 
and
 
vision,
 
redesigning
 
growth
 
strategy
 
in
 
the
 
light
 
of
 
a
 
dynamic
 
changing
 
external
 
environment.
 
 
A
 
reassessment
 
of
 
the
 
strategic
 
resources,
 
capabilities
 
and
 
competencies
 
suggested
 
through
 
the
 
perception
 
of
 
donors
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
developed
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
changing
 
needs
 
of
 
working
 
on
 
4
 


 
increasingly
 
interdisciplinary,
 
nexus
 
areas
 
cutting
 
across
 
energy,
 
environment,
 
and
 
other
 
natural
 
resources.
 
 
This
 
study
 
looks
 
at
 
the
 
perception
 
of
 
donors
 
across
 
six
 
levers,
 
i.e.,
 
growth,
 
impact,
 
risks,
 
demand,
 
visibility,
 
and
 
value
 
proposition.
 
The
 
approach
 
used
 
in
 
this
 
study
 
was
 
qualitative;
 
the
 
critical
 
informant
 
interviews
 
consisted
 
of
 
donors
 
across
 
the
 
old,
 
new,
 
and
 
retained
 
categories.
 
This
 
group
 
is
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
“Cohort
 
1”
 
subsequently
 
in
 
the
 
report.
 
The
 
Vision
 
2030
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
spearheaded
 
by
 
the
 
aspirations
 
to
 
Becoming
 
a
 
world-class
 
institution
 
in
 
data,
 
outreach,
 
and
 
analysis
 
of
 
global
 
signiﬁcance
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
impact
 
at
 
scale,
 
Moving
 
sustainability
 
from
 
the
 
“Margin”
 
to
 
“Mainstream”
 
by
 
working
 
across
 
the
 
themes
 
of
 
policy,
 
technology,
 
ﬁnance,
 
and
 
behaviour
 
to
 
transition
 
from
 
an
 
evidence-centric
 
policy
 
advisory
 
body
 
to
 
actioning
 
research,
 
enable
 
implementation
 
at
 
scale
 
etc.
 
 
The
 
critical
 
role
 
played
 
by
 
the
 
donor
 
and
 
the
 
funding
 
ecosystem
 
to
 
support
 
this
 
transition
 
requires
 
maturity
 
of
 
the
 
engagement
 
from
 
transactional
 
to
 
transformational
 
reality,
 
betting
 
on
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
investing
 
in
 
the
 
same.
 
With
 
the
 
impending
 
risks
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
Foreign
 
Contribution
 
Regulation
 
Act
 
(FCRA)
 
laws,
 
it
 
is
 
paramount
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
diversiﬁes
 
the
 
portfolio
 
of
 
funding
 
to
 
funders
 
and
 
mechanisms
 
that
 
allow,
 
Investing
 
in
 
the
 
institutional
 
development
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
building
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
of
 
the
 
organisation.
 
 
Investing
 
in
 
integrated
 
ideas
 
and
 
not
 
restricting
 
their
 
funds
 
to
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
sector/domain,
 
making
 
big
 
bets
 
to
 
achieve
 
transformation
 
across
 
the
 
larger
 
ecosystem
 
and
 
 
Supporting
 
the
 
linkages
 
of
 
markets
 
within
 
and
 
outside
 
the
 
country.
 
 
The
 
second
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
covers
 
the
 
landscape
 
of
 
potential
 
donors
 
incorporating
 
the
 
new
 
dimensions
 
for
 
expansion.
 
In
 
the
 
report,
 
we
 
refer
 
to
 
this
 
group
 
as
 
“
Cohort
 
2
”.
 
 
The
 
possibilities
 
of
 
aligning
 
with
 
the
 
new
 
priorities
 
and,
 
if
 
required,
 
developing
 
new
 
strategies,
 
structures,
 
systems,
 
and
 
processes
 
to
 
assist
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
laying
 
out
 
its
 
roadmap
 
and
 
blueprint
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
decade
 
and
 
beyond
 
allowed
 
the
 
study
 
to
 
shortlist
 
a
 
probable
 
set
 
of
 
institutions
 
and
 
donors.
 
 
The
 
opportunities
 
arising
 
post
 
the
 
Paris
 
Agreement
 
and
 
India’s
 
Nationally
 
Determined
 
Contributions
 
(NDCs)
 
are
 
further
 
encapsulated
 
as
 
“Panchamrit”
 
for
 
2030
 
targets.
 
They
 
were
 
shaping
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
fundamental
 
tailwinds
 
for
 
new-age
 
philanthropists,
 
donors,
 
corporations,
 
and
 
foundations
 
to
 
view
 
the
 
domains
 
of
 
climate
 
change
 
and
 
its
 
impact
 
with

The

in
 
each

practical.
 
 
However,
 
a
 
general
 
sentiment
 
has
 
been
 
that
 
The

claims
 
attribution
 
beyond
 
its
 
proportionate
 
share
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
policy

an

However,
 
all
 
donors
 
have
 
expressed
 
a
 
“felt
 
need”
 
for
 
an
 
effective
 
communication
 
strategy
 
(4
 
donors)

Having
 
concurrent

of
 
the
 
engaging
 
programme,
 
engaging
 
the
 
communication
 
team
 
from
 
the
 
beginning,
 
etc.,
 
is
 
becoming
 
necessary
.
 
A
 
concerted
 
effort
 
in
 
this
 
direction,
 
especially
 
using
 
various
 
media
 
and
 
diverse
 
communication
 
channels,
 
including
 
social

help
 
the

stay
 
adept
 
with
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
work
 
by
 
The
 
Council.
 
Donors
 
also
 
perceived
 
that
 
effective
 
communication

awareness
 
assist
 
them
 
with
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
more
 
interdisciplinary

Technology

innovation
 
 
○
 
The
 
donors
 
did
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
thoughts
 
on
 
The
 
Council
 
being
 
at
 
the
 
forefront
 
of
 
technology
 
and
 
innovation.
 
More
 
efforts
 
are
 
required
 
in
 
communication
 
and
 
advocacy
 
on
 
the
 
work
 
the
 
Council
 
has
 
undertaken.
 
The
 
second
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
aimed
 
to
 
explore
 
the
 
landscape
 
of
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability-related
 
ﬁnancing
 
in
 
India,
 
details
 
of
 
which
 
are
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
report
 
from
 
secondary
 
data
 
collection.
 
 
The
 
primary
 
research
 
involved
 
discussions
 
with
 
a
 
limited
 
number
 
of
 
Indian
 
philanthropists,
 
High
 
Net-worth
 
Individuals
 
(HNIs),
 
impact
 
investors,
 
and
 
the
 
socially
 
responsible
 
investing
 
community
 
threw
 
up
 
alternatives
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
evaluate.
 
●
 
The
 
new
 
age
 
philanthropists
 
are
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
progressive
 
funding
 
organisations
 
with
 
a
 
ﬂexible
 
outlook
 
on
 
their
 
funding
 
approaches.
 
They
 
are
 
more
 
focused
 
on
 
moving
 
the
 
needle
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
which
 
involves
 
funding
 
the
 
nexus
 
of
 
sectors.
 
They
 
are
 
more
 
open
 
to
 
institutional
 
funding
 
as
 
well,
 
which
 
involves
 
patient
 
capital.
 
 
o
 
Another
 
key
 
aspect
 
of
 
this
 
group
 
is
 
the
 
“laissez-faire”
 
approach
 
to
 
funding
 
where
 
there
 
are
 
limited
 
restrictions
 
on
 
the
 
funds
 
being
 
deployed.
 
However,
 
they
 
do
 
follow
 
a
 
very
 
free
 
ﬂowing
 
approach
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
deciding
 
on
 
the
 
areas
 
they
 
fund.
 
 
o
 
They
 
largely
 
fund
 
issues
 
that
 
are
 
closer
 
to
 
their
 
heart.
 
From
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
investments,
 
approach
 
to
 
the
 
same,
 
and
 
expectations
 
this
 
group
 
aligns
 
very
 
well
 
with
 
the
 
perspective
 
of
 
The
 
Council’s
 
onward-looking
 
journey.
  
 
●
 
The
 
impact
 
investor
 
group
 
aligns
 
broadly
 
with
 
the
 
vision
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
larger
 
impact
 
that
 
they
 
hope
 
to
 
create.
 
This
 
group
 
predominantly
 
makes
 
equity-based
 
investments,
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
inclusive
 
of
 
the
 
non-proﬁt
 
organisation
 
with
 
successful
 
social
 
models
 
engaged
 
through
 
a
 
grant.
  
 
o
 
This
 
subset
 
of
 
donors
 
adopts
 
a
 
structured
 
framework
 
and
 
approach
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
deploying
 
their
 
funds
 
with
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
focus
 
areas
 
which
 
are
 
decided
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
larger
 
strategies
 
of
 
the
 
portfolio.

o
 
Approaching
 
this
 
subset
 
of
 
donors
 
would
 
require
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
strengthen
 
its
 
systems
 
and
 
processes
 
as
 
the
 
reporting
 
requirements
 
are
 
high
 
for
 
this
 
group
 
of
 
investors.
 
The
 
investments
 
focus
 
on
 
speciﬁc,
 
measurable
 
outcomes.
 
 
o
 
In
 
case
 
of
 
not-for-proﬁt
 
organisations,
 
the
 
impact
 
is
 
deﬁned
 
across
 
social
 
and
 
economic
 
divisions
 
with
 
clear-cut
 
deﬁnitions.
 
While
 
this
 
group
 
of
 
investors
 
align
 
broadly
 
with
 
the
 
direction
 
in
 
which
 
The
 
Council
 
wants
 
to
 
go,
 
few
 
pivots
 
must
 
be
 
made
 
to
 
tap
 
into
 
these
 
funds.
 
●
 
The
 
ﬁnal
 
groups
 
that
 
emerged
 
are
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
and
 
debt-based
 
investors.
 
There
 
is
 
limited
 
funding
 
in
 
this
 
space
 
that
 
looks
 
at
 
the
 
nexus
 
of
 
sectors.
 
 
o
 
Investments
 
in
 
the
 
group
 
are
 
equity-based
 
with
 
few
 
companies
 
offering
 
debt
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
quasi-equity.
 
The
 
key
 
focus
 
for
 
this
 
group
 
is
 
the
 
return
 
on
 
ﬁnancial
 
investments
 
and
 
the
 
sustainability
 
of
 
cash
 
ﬂows.
 
 
o
 
Investments
 
are
 
clearly
 
expected
 
to
 
generate
 
returns
 
from
 
a
 
ﬁnancial
 
point;
 
slightly
 
lower
 
than
 
the
 
industry
 
average,
 
but
 
the
 
ﬁnancial
 
return
 
is
 
non-negotiable.
 
In
 
most
 
cases,
 
social
 
returns
 
are
 
not
 
measured
 
post
 
the
 
investment
 
and
 
are
 
only
 
a
 
criterion
 
for
 
making
 
the
 
investment.
 
 
o
 
For
 
The
 
Council,
 
at
 
this
 
stage
 
of
 
their
 
journey,
 
this
 
subset
 
does
 
not
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
set
 
expectations.
 
The
 
Council
 
might
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
signiﬁcant
 
governance
 
mechanisms
 
and
 
changes
 
from
 
the
 
current
 
structure
 
such
 
as
 
setting
 
up

Introduction
 
The

is
 
one
 
of
 
Asia’s
 
leading
 
not-for-proﬁt
 
policy
 
research
 
institutions.
 
It
 
uses
 
data,
 
integrated
 
analysis,
 
and
 
strategic
 
outreach
 
to
 
explain
 
–
 
and
 
change
 
–
 
the
 
use,
 
reuse,
 
and
 
misuse
 
of
 
resources.
 
 
Over
 
90%
 
of
 
The
 
Council’s
 
funding
 
is
 
generated
 
from
 
third-party
 
grants,
 
dependent
 
upon
 
agreed
 
project
 
deliverables
 
and
 
policy
 
changes

these
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
are
 
central
 
to
 
chalking
 
new

vision
 
for
 
the

This

The

managed
 
to
 
create
 
the
 
largest
 
database
 
on
 
India's
 
industrial
 
GHG
 
emissions.
 
They
 
have
 
contributed
 
to
 
drafting
 
the
 
National
 
Hydrogen
 
Mission
 
as
 
a
 
foundation
 
of
 
low-carbon
 
industrialisation.
 
 
●

adopted
 
KPIs
 
and
 
impact
 
metrics,
 
derived
 
from
 
its
 
strategy
 
and
 
sectoral
 
benchmarks
 
to
 
assess
 
performance
 
as
 
a

are
 
focused
 
on
 
criteria
 
like
 
reports
 
published,
 
media
 
coverage,
 
engagement
 
with
 
governments,
 
gender

etc.
 
These
 
measurable
 
values
 
demonstrate
 
how
 
effectively
 
The

achieves
 
its
 
key
 
objective
 
and
 
captures
 
the
 
essence
 
of
 
its
 
overall
 
success.
 
These
 
indicators
 
and
 
metrics
 
can
 
add
 
substantial
 
value
 
to
 
The
 
Council
 
by
 
collectively
 
framing
 
issues
 
of
 
importance,
 
providing
 
deep
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of

:
 
Analysing
 
how
 
donors
 
perceive
 
The

governance
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
risks
 
that
 
The

must
 
be
 
resilient
 
against,
 
whether
 
emanating
 
from
 
internal
 
processes,
 
external
 
environment,
 
or
 
strategic
 
directions.

and
 
ﬁnding

:
 
Assessing

including
 
being
 
integrated
 
into

The

The
 
sampling
 
approach
 
to
 
Cohort

was
 
to
 
identify
 
donors
 
that
 
could
 
potentially
 
align
 
with
 
The
 
Council’s
 
Vision
 
2030.
 
A
 
very
 
robust
 
secondary
 
research
 
and
 
expert
 
consultation
 
went
 
into
 
examining
 
the
 
funding
 
landscape
 
and
 
proﬁles
 
of
 
different
 
categories
 
of
 
donors
 
and
 
investors.
 
The
 
detailed

from
 
this

Based
 
on
 
the

of

nature,
 
i.e.,
 
the
 
motivation
 
of
 
the
 
donor,
 
the
 
giving
 
intent
 
and
 
core-institutional
 
funding;
 
the
 
potential
 
donors
 
for
 
this
 
approach
 
could
 
be
 
shortlisted.
 
E.g.,
 
Rohini
 
Nilekani
 
(from
 
the
 
perspectives
 
of
 
IIHS,
 
Arghyam,
 
Takshashila
 
Institute

(from
 
the

and
 
various

approach
 
Collaborative

The
 
focus
 
is
 
on
 
philanthropists
 
and
 
philanthropic
 
organisations
 
who
 
rally
 
around
 
a
 
shared
 
idea,
 
which
 
demands
 
not
 
only
 
pooling
 
resources
 
but
 
also
 
intersectional
 
solutions
 
and
 
deployment
 
at
 
scale,
 
enabling
 
systems
 
and
 
environments.
 
e.g.,
 
EDGE
 
Funders
 
Corporates

This
 
is
 
a
 
potential
 
area
 
where
 
the
 
sectoral
 
needs
 
and
 
advancements
 
overlap
 
with
 
the
 
regulatory
 
direction,
 
compliance,
 
and
 
market
 
growth.
 
e.g.,
 
Climate

Research
 
consortiums
 
and
 
platform
 
approach
 
In
 
this
 
approach,
 
the
 
proposition
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
core
 
research
 
anchor
 
in
 
the
 
research
 
and
 
knowledge
 
platform.
 
The
 
core
 
functions
 
of
 
the
 
consortium
 
would
 
be
 
governed
 
by
 
the
 
core
 
research
 
group
 
(The
 
Council).
 
The
 
network
 
would
 
be
 
membered
 
by
 
think

institutions
 
committed
 
to

generation
 
across

etc.
 
While
 
these
 
are
 
the
 
above
 
categories
 
envisioned
 
for
 
cohort

based
 
on
 
multiple
 
conversations
 
with
 
the
 
leadership
 
team
 
at
 
The
 
Council,
 
below
 
are
 
the

i.e.,
 
the

and
 
core-institutional

the
 
potential

for
 
this

could
 
be
 
shortlisted.
 
E.g.,
 
Rohini
 
Nilekani
 
(from
 
the

Takshashila

and
 
various
 
causes.
 
 
2.
 
Collaboration
 
with
 
Incubators/Impact
 
Investors
 
Here,
 
we
 
are
 
looking
 
at
 
impact
 
investors
 
who
 
are
 
operating
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
of
 
climate
 
&amp;
 
sustainability.
 
This
 
includes
 
social
 
business
 
incubators,
 
angel
 
investors
 
and
 
impact
 
inventors,
 
as
 
discussed
 
earlier.
 
We
 
consider
 
this
 
as
 
an
 
exploration
 
cohort
 
where
 
currently,
 
there
 
is
 
limited
 
engagement
 
with
 
this
 
cohort,
 
and
 
there
 
might
 
be
 
signiﬁcant
 
changes
 
required
 
from
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
tap
 
into
 
this
 
cohort.
 
E.g.,
 
Aavishkar,
 
Yunus
 
Social
 
Business,
 
Acumen
 
etc.
 
 
Based
 
on
 
this
 
research
 
typologies
 
1
 
and
 
2
 
were
 
selected
 
for
 
shortlisting.
 
Following
 
this,
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
metrics
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
score
 
the
 
donors
 
for
 
ﬁnal
 
selection.
 
 
The
 
larger
 
theme
 
of
 
sustainability
 
18
 


 
The
 
investor
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
sustainability
 
with
 
multiple
 
investments
 
in
 
sustainability.
 
Moving
 
sustainability
 
from
 
the
 
“Margin”
 
to
 
“Mainstream”
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
agenda
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
decade
 
and
 
hence
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
metric
 
considered
 
to
 
ﬁnalise
 
investors
 
for
 
Cohort
 
2.
  
 
Past
 
instances
 
of
 
funding

to
 
for-proﬁt
 
enterprises
 
 
Investors
 
with
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
funding
 
non-proﬁts
 
would
 
get
 
a
 
preference
 
in
 
our
 
listing,
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
fund
 
The
 
Council.
 
 
Funding
 
nexus
 
of
 
sectors
 
rather
 
than
 
focus
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
sector
 
The
 
funding
 
nexus
 
of
 
sectors
 
in
 
the
 
domain
 
of
 
climate,
 
sustainability
 
and
 
energy
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
criterion
 
for
 
The
 
Council.
  
It
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
partner
 
with
 
investors
 
who
 
share
 
a
 
vision
 
like
 
that
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
  
 
 
Funding
 
institutional
 
development
 
and
 
not
 
just
 
sectoral
 
outcomes
 
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
achieve
 
its
 
goals
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
decade,
 
focusing
 
on
 
investors
 
who
 
focus
 
on
 
‘People’
 
and
 
‘Institutions’
 
is
 
key.
 
Investors
 
focussing
 
less
 
on
 
outcome-based
 
funding
 
and
 
more
 
on
 
core
 
funding
 
would
 
ﬁt
 
better
 
with
 
the
 
vision
 
for
 
The
 
Council.

networking
 
potential
 
For
 
CMS
 
to
 
access
 
these
 
investors,
 
having
 
existing
 
relationships
 
was
 
important.
 
 
According
 
to
 
the

Survey
 
Tools
 
 
A
 
structured
 
self-assessment
 
tool
 
was
 
developed
 
comprising
 
a
 
close-ended,
 
rubric
 
scale
 
with
 
a
 
perception
 
tracking
 
questionnaire,
 
mapping
 
critical
 
indicators
 
across
 
growth,
 
demand,
 
impact,
 
visibility,
 
value
 
proposition
 
and
 
risk.
 
This
 
tool
 
did
 
not
 
receive
 
uptake
 
and
 
was
 
subsequently
 
dropped.
 
 
The
 
In-depth
 
Interview
 
(IDI)/KIIs
 
were
 
open-ended
 
questionnaires
 
with
 
a
 
contextualised
 
approach
 
to
 
individual
 
donors
 
sampled
 
across
 
Cohort
 
1
 
and
 
Cohort
 
2.

The
 
interaction
 
was
 
open-ended,
 
and
 
the
 
discussions
 
evolved
 
from
 
the
 
questions
 
guided
 
by
 
the
 
analytical
 
framework.
 
The
 
interviews
 
covered
 
key
 
aspects
 
such
 
as
 
donors’
 
engagement
 
with
 
The
 
Council,
 
services
 
they
 
received,
 
their
 
value
 
and
 
impact,
 
and
 
aspects
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
that
 
distinguish
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
 
During
 
the
 
interviews,
 
the
 
overall
 
content
 
of
 
the
 
questions
 
was
 
organic
 
and
 
remained
 
consistent.
 
However,
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
coverage,
 
the
 
sequencing
 
of
 
the
 
questions
 
and
 
the
 
probes
 
were
 
modiﬁed
 
to
 
streamline
 
and
 
guide
 
the
 
conversations.

Study
 
limitations
 
and
 
challenges
 
The
 
methodology
 
for
 
the
 
perception
 
survey
 
among
 
the
 
donor
 
community
 
was
 
conceived
 
with
 
two
 
donor
 
cohorts:
 
Cohort
 
1:
 
Donors
 
who
 
have
 
collaborated
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
or
 
are
 
currently
 
collaborating
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
were
 
sampled
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
key
 
donor
 
perceptions
 
on
 
their
 
interaction.
 
 
Cohort
 
2:
 
A
 
sample
 
of
 
potential
 
donors
 
was
 
curated
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
aspirations
 
and
 
Vision
 
2030
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
 
The
 
initial
 
study
 
design
 
–
 
sampling
 
schema
 
and
 
study
 
tools,
 
varied
 
from
 
the
 
design
 
that
 
was
 
executed
 
on
 
account
 
of
 
limited
 
response
 
from
 
the
 
sampled
 
respondents.
 
 
The
 
proposed
 
study
 
design,
 
for
 
instance,
 
included
 
the
 
deployment
 
of
 
an
 
online
 
self-assessment
 
tool
 
for
 
Cohort
 
1
 
donors,
 
Key
 
Informant
 
Interviews
 
(KII)
 
and
 
In-depth
 
Interviews
 
(IDI)
 
with
 
both
 
cohorts
 
and
 
case
 
studies.
 
The
 
self-assessment
 
tool
 
for
 
Cohort
 
1,
 
sent
 
to
 
54
 
donors
 
did
 
not
 
receive
 
the
 
expected
 
uptake
 
despite
 
over
 
six
 
reminders
 
being
 
sent
 
to
 
the
 
donors,
 
including
 
two
 
from
 
The
 
Council
 
CEO
 
desk.
 
Because
 
of
 
the
 
low
 
response,
 
a
 
collective
 
decision
 
was
 
taken
 
to
 
not
 
pursue
 
the
 
online
 
self-assessment
 
survey
 
and
 
to
 
rather
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
donor
 
interviews.
 
The
 
successive
 
case
 
studies
 
were
 
also
 
dropped,
 
considering
 
the
 
response
 
rates
 
and
 
the
 
intensity
 
of
 
participation.
 
21
 


 
In
 
the
 
interviews,
 
the
 
study
 
managed
 
to
 
complete
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
planned
 
interactions
 
across
 
both
 
Cohorts.
 
 
In
 
a
 
few
 
cases,
 
such
 
as
 
with
 
MacArthur
 
Foundation,
 
UAF,
 
Oak
 
Foundation
 
etc.,
 
CMS
 
reached
 
out
 
via
 
its
 
existing
 
networks
 
as
 
the
 
contact
 
details
 
shared
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
were
 
obsolete
 
or
 
non-responsive.
 
Few
 
of
 
these
 
donors,
 
despite
 
acknowledging
 
the
 
invitation,
 
did
 
not
 
respond.
 
 
In
 
Cohort
 
2,
 
despite
 
completing
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
planned
 
interactions
 
the
 
biggest
 
challenge
 
was
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
responses
 
from
 
the
 
participants.
 
This
 
was
 
especially
 
so
 
in
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
space,
 
where
 
investors
 
were
 
not
 
aware
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
particular
 
or
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
general
 
and
 
struggled
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
the
 
study.
 
 
The
 
following
 
sections
 
on
 
the
 
sampling
 
and
 
tools
 
capture
 
both
 
the
 
proposed
 
and
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
sets
 
deployed.

with
 
an

into
 
the
 
sector-wise
 
ﬂow
 
of
 
funds
 
and
 
the
 
trend
 
and
 
opportunities
 
in
 
India.
 
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
positioned
 
to
 
take
 
advantage
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
funding
 
approaches.
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
leveraged
 
by
 
the
 
Centre
 
of
 
Energy

which
 
has
 
been
 
deepening
 
markets,
 
increasing
 
transparency,
 
and
 
attracting
 
capital
 
to
 
emerging
 
economies.
 
Since
 
2019,
 
the
 
Centre
 
of
 
Energy

has
 
also
 
been
 
designing
 
the
 
Common
 
Risk
 
Mitigation
 
Mechanism
 
to
 
unlock
 
ﬁnances
 
for

and
 
designing

to
 
compare
 
and
 
recommend

some

The

Climate
 
ﬁnancing
 
approaches
 
by
 
domestic
 
corporations
 
and
 
their
 
CSR
 
arms
 
CSR
 
funds
 
are
 
available
 
consistently
 
every
 
year;
 
however,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
strategic
 
misalignment,
 
especially
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
channelled
 
towards
 
short-term
 
projects
 
or
 
programmes
 
but
 
not
 
evidence
 
generation
 
to
 
inform
 
policy,
 
transformative
 
causes
 
or
 
developing
 
research
 
institutions.
 
 
Discussions
 
with
 
the
 
sectoral
 
experts
 
depict
 
that
 
&gt;90%
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
arrangements
 
are
 
driven
 
by
 
contractual
 
service
 
agreements
 
for
 
formative
 
or
 
summative
 
programmatic
 
research
 
and
 
CSR
 
portfolio
 
management,
 
but
 
rarely
 
entertain
 
grant-making
 
approaches.
 
 
In
 
summary,
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
direct
 
reference
 
from
 
the
 
Indian
 
sustainability
 
landscape
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
investments
 
and
 
outcomes
 
from
 
the
 
research
 
portfolio.
 
Yet
 
there
 
are
 
resounding
 
research
 
and
 
development
 
opportunities
 
in
 
providing
 
insightful
 
guidance
 
in
 
designing
 
ﬁnancial
 
products
 
and
 
services.
 
Unless
 
this
 
is
 
driven
 
through
 
government-funded
 
incubation
 
centres
 
in
 
academic
 
institutions
 
that
 
could
 
focus
 
on
 
energy
 
and
 
environment
 
start-up
 
models-both
 
for-proﬁt
 
and
 
not-for-proﬁt,
 
the
 
sustenance
 
of
 
funds
 
for
 
effective
 
think
 
tank
 
work
 
would
 
always
 
be
 
limited.
 
Accordingly,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
wider
 
opportunity
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
access
 
to
 
ﬁnance,
 
promoting
 
sectoral
 
initiatives

Philanthropy
 
in
 
India
 
 
In
 
Indian
 
domestic
 
philanthropy
 
has
 
changed
 
quite
 
a
 
bit
 
in
 
recent
 
years;
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
absolute
 
numbers,
 
the
 
funding
 
has
 
grown
 
from
 
INR
 
12,500
 
crores
 
in
 
2010
 
to
 
INR
 
55,000

in
 
2018.

Key
 
takeaways
 
from
 
secondary
 
research
 
Following
 
are
 
the
 
areas
 
from
 
the
 
perspective
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
scope
 
for
 
engagement.
 
 
1.
 
Research
 
and
 
advisory
 
–
 
In
 
research
 
and
 
advisory
 
services,
 
assisting
 
philanthropists
 
in
 
an
 
evidence-based
 
approach
 
to
 
deploying
 
funds
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
fundamental
 
value
 
add.
 
 
2.
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation
 
and
 
Learning
 
–
 
Reporting
 
is
 
another
 
critical
 
area
 
where
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
movement
 
has
 
happened;
 
this
 
has
 
promoted
 
a
 
culture
 
of
 
monitoring,
 
evaluation
 
and
 
learning
 
across
 
the
 
sector,
 
which
 
results
 
in
 
better
 
donor
 
reporting.
 
3.
 
Collective,
 
visioning,
 
giving,
 
and
 
learning
 
–
 
Mobilising
 
multiple
 
stakeholders
 
towards
 
collaborative
 
giving,
 
resulting
 
in
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
investment-ready
 
solutions
 
for
 
large-scale
 
impact.

The
 
conversation
 
depicted
 
the
 
journey
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
since
 
its
 
inception
 
and
 
its
 
future
 
aspirations
 
as
 
a
 
pioneering
 
research
 
think
 
tank
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
sector.
 
 
To
 
become
 
a
 
world-class
 
institution
 
in
 
data,
 
outreach,
 
and
 
analysis
 
of
 
global
 
signiﬁcance
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
impact
 
at
 
scale,
 
 
Moving
 
sustainability
 
from
 
the
 
“Margin”
 
to
 
“Mainstream”
 
by
 
working
 
across
 
the
 
themes
 
of
 
policy,
 
technology,
 
ﬁnance,
 
and
 
behaviour
 
to
 
transition
 
from
 
an
 
evidence-centric
 
policy
 
advisory
 
body
 
to
 
actioning
 
research,
 
enable
 
implementation
 
at
 
scale
 
etc.
   
 
This
 
vision
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
requires
 
donors
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
domains
 
of
 
sustainability
 
across
 
the
 
spectrum
 
of
 
food,
 
agriculture,
 
water,
 
energy,
 
etc.
 
With
 
the
 
impending
 
risk
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
FCRA
 
laws,
 
it
 
is
 
paramount
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
looks
 
at
 
local
 
donors
 
who
 
can
 
participate
 
in
 
The
 
Council’s
 
journey
 
going
 
forward.
 
These
 
are
 
donors
 
that
 
would:
 
 
Invest
 
in
 
the
 
institutional
 
development
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
build
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
of
 
the
 
organisation.
 
 
Invest
 
in
 
integrated
 
ideas
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
restrict
 
their
 
funds
 
to
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
sector/domain,
 
make
 
big
 
bets
 
to
 
achieve
 
transformation
 
across
 
the
 
larger
 
ecosystem
 
and
 
 
Support
 
linkages
 
of
 
markets
 
within
 
and
 
outside
 
the
 
country.
 
 
Subsequently,
 
the
 
discussion
 
with
 
the
 
portfolio
 
leads
 
and
 
key
 
personnel
 
assisted
 
in
 
providing
 
a
 
holistic
 
view
 
of
 
the
 
various
 
engagement
 
and
 
operational
 
models,
 
core
 
strength
 
of
 
the
 
institutions,
 
value
 
proposition,
 
donor
 
engagement
 
strategies,
 
and
 
potential
 
for
 
impact
 
across
 
the
 
portfolios
 
and
 
sector.
 
The
 
conversations
 
with
 
the
 
enabler
 
functions
 
such
 
as
 
Finance
 
and
 
HR
 
enabled
 
an
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
strengths
 
and
 
challenges
 
within
 
The

8.1
 
Challenges
 
and
 
limitations
 
 
The
 
concentration
 
of
 
FCRA
 
funds
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
funding
 
The
 
Council
 
currently
 
manages
 
has
 
a
 
high
 
reliance
 
on
 
international
 
grant-making
 
agencies
 
and
 
donors.
 
With
 
the
 
recent
 
restrictions
 
to
 
the
 
FCRA
 
rules,
 
there
 
are
 
clear
 
concentration
 
risks.
 
 
The
 
Council
 
must
 
pivot
 
towards
 
domestic
 
funds
 
(untied
 
and
 
institutional
 
per
 
se)
 
to
 
offset
 
the
 
risk
 
posed
 
by
 
the
 
high
 
concentration
 
of
 
FCRA
 
funds.
 
 
Siloed
 
leadership
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
engagement
 
and
 
grant
 
management
 
is
 
undertaken
 
by
 
the
 
strategic
 
leadership
 
group
 
at
 
The
 
Council.
 
The
 
key
 
personnel
 
group
 
front
 
ends
 
the
 
conversation
 
from
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
lead
 
generation,
 
proposal
 
making,
 
engaging
 
with
 
donors,
 
etc.
 
However,
 
the
 
process
 
is
 
not
 
institutionalised,
 
and
 
if
 
strategic
 
leaders
 
exit
 
The
 
Council,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
probability
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
losing
 
donors
 
Outcome-based
 
funding
 
expectations
 
Outcome-based
 
funding
 
and
 
results-based
 
funding
 
have
 
been
 
picking
 
up
 
among
 
grant-making
 
agencies
 
and
 
donors
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
years.
 
This
 
practice
 
is
 
constrained
 
to
 
leverage
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
of
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacity
 
building,
 
institutional
 
development,
 
talent
 
acquisition,
 
etc.
 
A
 
genuine
 
lack
 
of
 
untied
 
programmatic
 
funding
 
is
 
a
 
constraint
 
and
 
a
 
deterrent
 
to
 
the
 
growth
 
of
 
grant-dependent
 
institutions
 
like
 
research
 
think
 
tanks
 
and
 
especially
 
so
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
of
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability.
 
Effective
 
advocacy
 
and
 
dissemination
 
Maintaining
 
a
 
healthy
 
communication
 
system
 
with
 
the
 
grant-making
 
agencies
 
and
 
the
 
donors
 
is
 
key
 
to
 
sustaining
 
partnerships.
 
However,
 
The
 
Council
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
streamlined
 
system
 
(newsletters,
 
update
 
mailers
 
etc.)
 
as
 
of
 
now,
 
indicated
 
as
 
a
 
pain
 
point
 
by
 
a
 
few
 
donors.
 
Secondly,
 
integrating
 
various
 
portfolios
 
of
 
activities,
 
successes
 
etc.,
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
the
 
position
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
the
 
network
 
of
 
domains
 
and
 
services
 
offered.
 
Thirdly,
 
supporting
 
or
 
leading
 
the
 
communication
 
of
 
programmatic
 
work,
 
or
 
donor
 
collaborative
 
communication,
 
is
 
a
 
genuine
 
area
 
that
 
collectively
 
needs
 
reinforcement.

Leadership
 
 
The
 
vision
 
of
 
the
 
think

closely

the
 
ethos
 
and
 
the
 
vision
 
of
 
the
 
leader,
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
Ghosh,
 
a
 
big
 
strength
 
from
 
the
 
think
 
tank’s
 
perspective.
 
His
 
thought
 
leadership,
 
along
 
with
 
his
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
sector,
 
brings
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
to
 
The
 
Council’s
 
services
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
the
 
think
 
tank
 
creates.
 
Over
 
the
 
last
 
ten
 
years,
 
this
 
energy
 
has
 
fuelled
 
immense
 
success
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability.
 
Dr
 
Arunabha’s
 
leadership
 
and
 
governance
 
have
 
been
 
vital
 
to
 
this
 
achievement
 
and
 
current
 
positioning.

have
 
been
 
at

The
 
Council,
 
their
 
value
 
systems,
 
and
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
institution’s
 
strategy.
 
The
 
most
 
signiﬁcant
 
value

of
 
The

stems
 
from

According
 
to
 
the
 
human
 
resources
 
team,
 
the
 
attrition
 
rates
 
are
 
meagre,
 
and
 
the
 
tenures
 
of
 
its
 
key
 
strategic

have
 
been
 
long.
 
They

the
 
core
 
of
 
strategic

The

Transparency
 
The

Council
 
is
 
conceived
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
close
 
association
 
with
 
the
 
government,
 
and
 
they
 
leverage
 
government
 
strengths
 
effectively.
 
This
 
positions
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
a
 
unique
 
space
 
within
 
the
 
sector
 
where
 
their
 
services
 
and
 
engagements
 
are
 
fuelled
 
by
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
policymaking,
 
leveraging
 
the
 
strengths
 
of
 
the
 
government
 
objectively.
 
Trendsetter
 
approach
 
The
 
Council
 
identiﬁes
 
itself
 
as
 
solution
 
expert
 
and
 
early
 
mover
 
in
 
regard
 
to
 
shaping
 
sectoral
 
solutions,
 
identifying
 
critical
 
problem
 
statements,
 
working
 
at
 
the
 
intersection
 
of
 
sectors
 
etc.
 
The
 
Council’s
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
cooling
 
sector
 
(in
 
extension
 
to
 
the
 
NCAP
 
formulation)
 
and
 
the
 
nation’s
 
work
 
on
 
Hydrogen
 
based
 
fuels
 
are
 
good
 
examples
 
of
 
a
 
sector-shaping
 
agenda
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
by
 
gaining
 
the
 
early
 
mover
 
advantage.
 
The
 
intrinsic
 
trendsetting
 
approach
 
stems
 
from
 
the
 
value
 
proposition
 
that
 
leverages
 
social
 
and
 
human
 
capital.
 
This
 
effectively
 
allows
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
experiment,
 
take
 
risks,
 
and
 
convince
 
the
 
investment
 
ecosystem
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
where
 
the
 
sector
 
is
 
moving
 
towards.

Caveats
 
to
 
synthesising
 
the
 
perceptions
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
Strong
 
principles
 
and
 
approaches
 
govern
 
the
 
donor
 
perception
 
mapping
 
study.
 
It
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
keep
 
in
 
mind
 
that,
 
 
The
 
primary
 
data
 
is
 
highly
 
qualitative
 
and
 
captures
 
critical
 
perceptions
 
and
 
sentiments
 
from
 
the
 
donor
 
communities.
 
 
The
 
donors
 
have
 
interacted
 
with
 
the
 
evaluation
 
team
 
governed
 
by
 
trust
 
and
 
anonymity,
 
and
 
hence
 
the
 
synthesis
 
must
 
reﬂect
 
their
 
truest
 
contexts
 
and
 
perceptions
 
without
 
a
 
bias
 
concealing
 
their
 
identity.
 
The
 
nature
 
of
 
questioning
 
has
 
been
 
free
 
ﬂowing,
 
evolving
 
with
 
the
 
expression
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
(not
 
all
 
topics
 
are
 
covered
 
for
 
all
 
donors).
 
Opinions
 
and
 
the
 
intensity
 
of
 
perceptions
 
cannot
 
be
 
quantiﬁed
 
using
 
a
 
linear
 
approach.
 
While
 
the
 
synthesis
 
has
 
attempted
 
to
 
categorise
 
perceptions
 
and
 
opinions
 
using
 
a
 
composite
 
model
 
of
 
weightage,
 
contexts
 
and
 
experiences
 
are
 
something
 
the
 
evaluation
 
team
 
have
 
limited
 
information
 
about.
 
Wherever
 
appropriate
 
and
 
possible,
 
the
 
report
 
has
 
attempted
 
to
 
quote,
 
highlight,
 
and
 
provide
 
examples
 
of
 
the
 
donor’s
 
truest
 
perception
 
or
 
sentiment
 
without
 
losing
 
the
 
essence
 
and
 
revealing
 
the
 
donor’s
 
identity.
 
Wherever
 
appropriate
 
and
 
possible,
 
we
 
have
 
adopted
 
the
 
Gestalt
 
principles
 
of
 
perception
 
by
 
visualising
 
examples
 
and
 
contexts
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
donors
 
–
 
ﬁgure-ground
 
relationship,
 
proximity,
 
similarity,
 
continuity,
 
closure
 
etc.
 
The
 
perceptions
 
and
 
sentiments
 
collected
 
from
 
interactions
 
with
 
the
 
donors
 
have
 
been
 
qualitative
 
and
 
highly
 
contextual
 
to
 
their
 
experience
 
and
 
engagement
 
with
 
The
 
Council.
 
While
 
the
 
analytical
 
framework
 
guides
 
the
 
overall
 
lens
 
of
 
processing
 
the
 
perceptions
 
and
 
sentiment,
 
given
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
interviews
 
being
 
free
 
ﬂowing,
 
some
 
perceptions
 
were
 
reactive;
 
in
 
contrast,
 
some
 
came
 
after
 
quick
 
reﬂection
 
during
 
the
 
interview.
 
The
 
study
 
has
 
consciously
 
tried
 
to
 
eliminate
 
any
 
objective
 
or
 
conﬁrmation
 
or
 
information
 
biases
 
arising
 
from
 
donor
 
conversations
 
and
 
secondary
 
research.
 
 
The
 
perceptions
 
and
 
recommendations
 
are
 
processed
 
not
 
just
 
on
 
a
 
certain
 
percentage
 
of
 
donors
 
expressing
 
their
 
views;
 
instead,
 
a
 
weighted
 
synthesis
 
approach
 
has
 
been
 
adopted,
 
accounting
 
for
 
the
 
following
 
factors,
 
wherever
 
appropriate
 
and
 
possible,
 
1.

In

to
 
the

microelements
 
such
 
as

the

with
 
which
 
the

expressed
 
their
 
perceptions,
 
 
●
 
the
 
stress
 
and
 
emphasis
 
on
 
certain
 
perceptions
 
have
 
also
 
been
 
factored
 
in
 
 
 
E.g.,
 
If
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
donors
 
voiced
 
a
 
perception
 
through
 
strong
 
sentiments
 
by
 
providing
 
instances
 
and
 
examples
 
where
 
they
 
felt
 
The
 
Council
 
could
 
have
 
done
 
something
 
different,
 
for
 
instance,
 
that
 
perception
 
was
 
provided
 
higher
 
weightage
 
during

Assessment
 
of
 
perceptions
 
using
 
weights
 
 
To
 
illustrate
 
how
 
the
 
above
 
criteria
 
are
 
used,
 
please
 
refer
 
to
 
the
 
example
 
below.
 
 
Let
 
us
 
consider
 
Donor
 
A,
 
who
 
has
 
been
 
engaging
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
over
 
a
 
long-term
 
association
 
and
 
has
 
funded
 
The
 
Council
 
multiple
 
times;
 
however,
 
owing
 
to
 
certain
 
limitations,
 
Donor
 
A
 
is
 
unable
 
to
 
fund
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
 
Donor
 
B
 
is
 
a
 
new
 
donor,
 
engaging
 
with
 
the
 
council
 
for
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
time;
 
however,
 
they
 
are
 
more
 
closely
 
aligned
 
to
 
the
 
vision
 
and
 
the
 
journey
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
 
 
Donor
 
C
 
has
 
funded
 
The
 
Council
 
more
 
than
 
once;
 
however,
 
the
 
engagement
 
is
 
only
 
transactional
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
broadly
 
align
 
with
 
the
 
vision
 
and
 
journey
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
 
 
Using
 
the
 
weighted
 
synthesis
 
approach,
 
Donor
 
B’s
 
perceptions
 
would
 
rank
 
higher
 
than
 
A
 
as
 
Donor
 
B
 
scores
 
higher
 
on
 
criteria
 
2
 
and
 
3,
 
whereas
 
Donor
 
A
 
scores
 
higher
 
only
 
on
 
criteria
 
1.
 
Donor
 
C
 
ranks
 
the
 
lowest
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
above-mentioned
 
criteria.

The
 
role
 
of
 
ideal
 
Think
 
Tanks
 
 
A
 
quick
 
excerpt
 
from
 
the
 
discussion
 
with
 
experts
 
and
 
guided
 
literature
 
Think
 
tanks
 
play
 
a
 
critical
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
of
 
social
 
transformation.
 
Orchestrating
 
solutions
 
to
 
critical
 
economic,
 
social,
 
and
 
political
 
issues
 
are
 
at
 
its
 
core.
 
However,
 
think
 
tanks,
 
by
 
design,
 
foster
 
a
 
network
 
for
 
thought
 
leaders
 
to
 
collaborate,
 
develop
 
ideas
 
and
 
share
 
knowledge.
 
To
 
decode
 
further
 
into
 
the
 
engagement
 
mechanisms,
 
their
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
expanded
 
from
 
research
 
initiatives
 
to
 
conducting
 
ﬁeld
 
surveys,
 
collecting,
 
and
 
analysing
 
data
 
and
 
publishing
 
books,
 
journals,
 
and
 
reports
 
and
 
amongst
 
other
 
things
19
.
 
 
Shifting
 
the
 
axis
 
of
 
activities
 
to
 
generate
 
visibility
 
and
 
political
 
access
 
has
 
contributed
 
signiﬁcantly
 
to
 
intense
 
scrutiny
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
and
 
the
 
vagueness
 
of
 
characteristics
 
that
 
distinguish
 
them,
 
putting
 
the
 
credibility
 
and
 
the
 
sectoral
 
positioning
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
at
 
risk.

31
 


 
common
 
knowledge
 
that
 
think
 
tanks
 
exist
 
to
 
serve
 
the
 
nation’s
 
interest
 
and
 
not
 
a
 
group’s
 
interest.
 
The
 
role
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
uphold
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
policy
 
recommendations
 
or
 
offer
 
a
 
futuristic
 
perspective
 
without
 
any
 
keen
 
interest
 
in
 
a
 
plan.
 
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
organisations
 
operate
 
on
 
funds
 
from
 
the
 
donor
 
agencies
 
to
 
conduct
 
their
 
independent
 
research
 
work,
 
which
 
assists
 
them
 
in
 
pursuing
 
sector-shaping
 
research
 
agendas.
 
Many
 
think
 
tanks
 
use
 
this
 
funding
 
to
 
strengthen
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
organisation
 
and
 
contribute
 
to
 
their
 
sustainability.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
advocacy
 
and
 
dissemination,
 
many
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
India
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
globally
 
have
 
advanced
 
their
 
communication
 
and
 
outreach
 
strategy
 
and
 
increased
 
their
 
number
 
of
 
publications,
 
both
 
in
 
their
 
form
 
and
 
their
 
medium.
 
Think
 
tanks
 
have
 
branched
 
out
 
to
 
online
 
content
 
and
 
utilising
 
various
 
interactive
 
platforms.
 
These
 
elements
 
serve
 
as
 
key
 
quantiﬁable
 
criteria
 
for
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
assessing
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
work.
 
While
 
producing
 
a
 
higher
 
quantity
 
of
 
outputs
 
and
 
broadening
 
the
 
outreach,
 
substituted
 
as
 
an
 
effective
 
output
 
metric,
 
indicates
 
the
 
think
 
tank’s
 
relative
 
capacity.
 
However,
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
content
 
is
 
not
 
highlighted
20
.
 
 
On
 
the
 
organisation
 
management
 
front,
 
sound
 
leadership
 
and
 
good
 
governance
 
were
 
emphasised
 
as
 
the
 
foundational
 
elements
 
of
 
organisational
 
stability.
 
Expert
 
opinions
 
and
 
donor
 
perceptions
 
converged
 
on
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
think
 
tanks
 
gain
 
credibility
 
and
 
stability
 
from
 
a
 
strategic
 
leadership
 
model
 
that
 
assures
 
smooth
 
succession
 
and
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
a
 
strong
 
pool
 
of
 
leaders.
 
If
 
the
 
leadership
 
model
 
is
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
authority
 
of
 
the
 
founding
 
person
 
or
 
selected
 
leader,
 
then
 
the
 
models
 
would
 
fail
 
to
 
provide
 
credibility
 
overall
 
in
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
a
 
leader.
 
Moreover,
 
the
 
governance
 
neutrality
 
and
 
legitimacy
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
served
 
as
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
reasons
 
for
 
policy-making
 
agencies
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
them.
 
 
Donor’s
 
perception
 
Despite
 
the
 
broadly
 
shared
 
characteristics,
 
the
 
discussions
 
in
 
capturing
 
donor
 
perceptions
 
yielded
 
considerable
 
diversity
 
among
 
think
 
tanks
 
regarding
 
their
 
mandate,
 
priorities,
 
and
 
structures
 
in
 
India.
 
Some
 
examples
 
cited
 
during
 
our
 
conversation
 
with
 
the
 
donors
 
included
 
think
 
tanks
 
like
 
TERI
 
–
 
covering
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
topics
 
and
 
sectors,
 
including
 
climate
 
change,
 
energy
 
efﬁciency,
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
agriculture,
 
habitat,
 
and
 
social
 
transformation
 
as
 
opposed
 
to
 
CPR,
 
CPI
 
functioning
 
solely
 
as
 
a
 
research
 
institute.
 
Triangulating
 
the
 
secondary
 
research
 
with
 
the
 
opinions
 
from
 
the
 
donors
 
spotlights
 
that
 
advocacy
 
and
 
dissemination
 
through
 
events
 
and
 
convenings
 
were
 
key
 
qualities
 
which
 
provided
 
think
 
tanks
 
a
 
platform
 
for
 
effective
 
policy
 
discussion,
 
capacity
 
building,
 
and
 
networking,
 
convening
 
like-minded
 
people
 
to
 
collaborate
 
and
 
promote
 
high-level
 
dialogues.
 
However,
 
it
 
was
 
also
 
widely
 
perceived
 
that
 
the
 
convenings
 
often
 
took
 
a
 
toll
 
on
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
research,
 
and
 
the
 
knowledge
 
dissemination
 
role
 
of
 
the
 
think
 
tank
 
has
 
taken
 
a
 
back
 
seat
 
over
 
recent
 
year.
 
Given
 
the
 
demand
 
for
 
sustaining
 
the
 
institutions,
 
think
 
tanks
 
have
 
started
 
resorting
 
to
 
marketing
 
ideas
 
which
 
could
 
potentially
 
lead
 
to
 
a
 
change
 
of
 
priority
 
of
 
research
 
by
 
advocacy.

In
 
recent
 
years,
 
speciﬁc
 
to
 
the
 
Indian
 
context
 
on
 
think
 
tanks
 
funding,
 
it
 
was
 
found
 
that
 
several
 
think
 
tanks
 
faced
 
constraints
 
in
 
pursuing
 
the
 
research
 
agenda
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
funds
 
and
 
faced
 
challenges
 
in
 
garnering
 
support
 
from
 
local
 
philanthropy
 
or
 
government
 
donors.
 
These
 
think
 
tanks
 
were
 
left
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
government
 
and
 
a
 
few
 
international
 
philanthropies
 
to
 
keep
 
them
 
aﬂoat.
 
Through
 
the
 
study,
 
the
 
exploration
 
to
 
identify
 
pathways
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
enhance
 
its
 
reach
 
to
 
multiple
 
funders
 
include:
 
Expanding
 
its
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
and
 
covering
 
a
 
broad
 
range
 
of
 
domains
 
and
 
functions.
 
Increasing
 
their
 
interaction
 
through
 
collaboration
 
with
 
other
 
regional
 
or
 
international
 
think
 
tanks
 
working
 
on
 
different
 
areas.
 
The
 
expert
 
comments
 
and
 
the
 
donor
 
perceptions
 
converge
 
in
 
increasing
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
involvement
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
epistemic
 
and
 
policy
 
communities
 
in
 
generating
 
policy
 
ideas
 
and
 
fostering
 
debates
 
and
 
acting
 
as
 
a
 
bridge
 
between
 
research
 
and
 
policy
 
formulation.
 
Many
 
also
 
debated
 
on
 
measuring
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
attribute
 
a
 
policy
 
change.
 
The
 
discussions
 
provided
 
visibility
 
to
 
various
 
organisations
 
and
 
individuals
 
as
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
who
 
could
 
inﬂuence
 
policies
 
through
 
various
 
channels.
 
The
 
ability
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
policy
 
was
 
also
 
strongly
 
shaped
 
by
 
external
 
factors.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
policy
 
adoption
 
process
 
also
 
involved
 
broad
 
consultation
 
with
 
many
 
stakeholders,
 
and
 
thus
 
the
 
success
 
to
 
be
 
claimed
 
by
 
one
 
entity
 
was
 
fallacious.
 
 
To
 
better
 
understand
 
the
 
whole
 
paradigm
 
of
 
think
 
tanks’
 
inﬂuence
 
on
 
policy
 
outcome,
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
secondary
 
research
 
and
 
donor
 
perception,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
have
 
mapped
 
it

and

It
 
explains
 
where
 
the
 
real
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
falls.
 
 
While
 
think
 
tanks
 
have
 
grown
 
signiﬁcantly
 
and
 
demonstrated
 
the
 
capacity
 
to
 
execute
 
unbiased
 
research
 
and
 
analysis
 
and
 
provide
 
policy
 
recommendations
 
to
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
audiences,
 
there
 
are
 
complex,
 
recurring,
 
and
 
tiered
 
concerns
 
amongst
 
the
 
institutions,
 
most
 
of
 
which
 
hold
 
good
 
concerning
 
The
 
Council’s
 
scenario
 
as
 
well.
 
The
 
fundamental
 
structural
 
pillars
 
of
 
the
 
activities
 
and
 
research
 
of
 
think
 
tanks,
 
i.e.,
 
independence,
 
credibility,
 
sustainability,
 
and
 
ideology,
 
have
 
a
 
high
 
chance
 
of
 
becoming
 
frail
 
and
 
lagging
 
when
 
compromised.
 
Since
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
responsibility
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
to
 
determine
 
whether
 
their
 
works
 
demonstrate
 
credibility
 
and
 
add
 
value,
 
it
 
is
 
worth
 
noting
 
whether
 
it
 
is
 
time
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
rethink
 
their
 
overall
 
strategy
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
emerging
 
challenges.
 
Further,
 
consider
 
actively
 
engaging
 
their
 
audiences
 
through
 
carefully
 
34
 


 
designed
 
channels
 
to
 
reach
 
the
 
right
 
people
 
using
 
the
 
suitable
 
method
 
to
 
ensure
 
their
 
goals
 
are
 
met.

Growth

From
 
the
 
viewpoint
 
of
 
sectoral
 
leadership
 
and
 
experts,
 
broader
 
contours
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
characteristics,
 
roles,

been
 
critical
 
in
 
establishing
 
the
 
vision,

of
 
the

Given
 
the

history
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
space

institutions
 
have
 
consistently
 
performed
 
various

each
 
vertical,
 
ability
 
to
 
attract
 
funds
 
from
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of

etc.
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
consistently
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
leading
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
think
 
tank
 
space.
 
The
 
institution
 
is
 
considered
 
continually
 
active
 
in
 
policymaking.
 
It
 
is
 
perceived
 
to
 
occupy
 
a
 
unique
 
market
 
position,
 
having
 
healthy
 
donor
 
relationships,
 
and
 
possessing
 
key
 
partnerships,
 
which
 
have
 
been
 
built
 
effectively
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
decade
 
since
 
its
 
inception.
 
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
preliminary
 
engagements
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
decade
 
are
 
attributed
 
to
 
The
 
Council
 
being
 
a
 
fresh
 
and
 
inﬂuential
 
voice
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
(40%
 
of
 
the
 
donors);
 
now,
 
gradually,
 
donors
 
are
 
recognising
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
and
 
strengths.
 
The
 
donor
 
networks
 
from
 
Cohort
 
1
 
engaging
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
view
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
refreshing
 
think
 
tank.
 
Donors
 
also
 
highlighted
 
that
 
The
 
Council’s
 
young
 
and
 
vibrant
 
team
 
makes
 
them
 
unique
 
within
 
this
 
think
 
tank
 
space.
 
 
According
 
to
 
them,
 
a
 
younger
 
and
 
vibrant
 
think
 
tank
 
was
 
socially
 
engaging
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
other
 
mature
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
space,
 
receptive
 
to
 
independent
 
policy
 
research
 
and
 
able
 
to
 
conceive
 
and
 
work
 
on
 
complex
 
hypotheses.
 
There
 
was
 
greater
 
freedom
 
in
 
investment
 
decision-making
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
diversify
 
work
 
within
 
the
 
sectors,
 
and
 
sub-sectors
 
and
 
focus
 
on
 
sub
 
nationals’
 
geographies.
 
 
The
 
Cohort
 
1
 
donors
 
felt
 
that
 
in
 
future
 
those
 
donors
 
who
 
would
 
be
 
excited
 
by
 
new
 
opportunities
 
would
 
be
 
keen
 
to
 
collaborate
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
Having
 
a
 
young
 
and
 
energetic
 
team
 
is
 
The
 
Council’s
 
strength.
 
Their
 
teams
 
have
 
the
 
capacity
 
to
 
ideate
 
and
 
innovate
 
with
 
the
 
sectoral
 
experts
 
who
 
are
 
members
 
of
 
Government
 
committees
 
and
 
state-level
 
authorities.
 
They
 
quite
 
often
 
pursue
 
futuristic
 
research.
 
However,
 
there
 
was
 
also
 
a
 
perception
 
that
 
possession
 
of
 
characteristics
 
of
 
agility
 
and
 
receptiveness
 
limit
 
this
 
typology
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
from
 
building
 
long-term
 
ﬁnancial
 
and
 
organisational
 
sustainability.
 
This
 
view
 
was
 
predominant
 
among
 
the
 
donors
 
collaborating
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
who
 
have
 
been
 
working
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
extended
 
period
 
(25%
 
of
 
the
 
overall
 
sample).
 
Values
 
and
 
Virtues
 
The
 
core
 
values
 
and
 
principles
 
imbibed
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
are:
 
●
 
Being
 
integrated
 
into
 
analysis,
 
 
●
 
International/global
 
outlook,
 
 
●
 
Independent
 
of
 
funders
 
and
 
clients,
 
and
 
 
●
 
The
 
commitment
 
to
 
building
 
careers
 
in
 
public
 
policy.
 
The
 
vision
 
and
 
the
 
values
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
are
 
triangulated
 
by:
 
●
 
Their
 
self-perception,
 
 
●
 
The
 
perception
 
of
 
its
 
donors
 
and
 
key
 
partners
 
and
 
 
●
 
The
 
authenticity
 
of
 
the
 
perception
 
from
 
the
 
public
 
and
 
the
 
sector.

The
 
Council
 
is
 
perceived
 
to
 
be
 
exhibiting
 
a
 
high
 
degree
 
of
 
independence
 
in
 
conducting
 
the
 
research
 
and
 
advocating
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
despite
 
any
 
sensitivity
 
around
 
the
 
ﬁndings.
 
Four
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
who
 
responded,
 
cited
 
this
 
perception
 
with
 
instances
 
ranging
 
from
 
disseminating
 
to
 
the
 
practitioners
 
or
 
decision-makers
 
to
 
the
 
public.
 
 
Diving
 
deeper
 
into
 
speciﬁc
 
value
 
systems,
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
the
 
balance
 
between
 
being
 
an
 
independent
 
and
 
objective
 
research
 
entity,
 
i.e.,
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
generate
 
evidence
 
with
 
robustness
 
and
 
rigour,
 
to
 
interpret
 
the
 
data
 
in
 
its
 
truest
 
relationships
 
with
 
the
 
ecosystem,
 
may
 
it
 
be
 
the
 
geo-political
 
systems,
 
socio-cultural
 
systems,
 
or
 
the
 
market
 
and
 
economic
 
systems
 
 
Usually,
 
there
 
is
 
immense
 
pressure
 
from
 
evolving
 
environments
 
and
 
relevance,
 
integrity,
 
and
 
efﬁcacy
 
in
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
diverse
 
political,
 
economic,
 
and
 
academic
 
interests
 
are
 
increasingly
 
becoming
 
challenging.
 
 
As
 
a
 
leading
 
voice
 
in
 
India’s
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
sector,
 
The
 
Council
 
occupies
 
a
 
unique
 
position
 
and
 
has
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
difference.
 
There
 
are
 
real
 
and
 
burning
 
concerns
 
around
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
transition,
 
and
 
social
 
responsibility,
 
where
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
the
 
independence
 
and
 
the
 
power
 
to
 
voice
 
their
 
opinion
 
and
 
ignite
 
exciting
 
deliberations.
 
Even
 
within
 
the
 
limits
 
of
 
the
 
FCRA,
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
established
 
an
 
image
 
of
 
having
 
an
 
independent
 
position
 
and
 
has
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
being
 
a
 
leading
 
voice
 
in
 
India
 
positively.
 
 
Two
 
donors
 
who
 
responded
 
in
 
this
 
regard,
 
acknowledged
 
that
 
while
 
The
 
Council
 
adjusted
 
their
 
strategy
 
to
 
meet
 
donor
 
expectations,
 
they
 
did
 
not
 
compromise
 
on
 
the
 
true
 
ﬁndings
 
of
 
the
 
sectors,
 
thereby
 
maintaining
 
their
 
ambitious
 
standards
 
and
 
values
 
of
 
research.
 
They
 
were
 
also
 
able
 
to
 
integrate
 
their
 
efforts
 
across
 
all
 
sectors
 
and
 
build
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
approach
 
that
 
drew
 
in
 
prospective
 
donors.
 
The
 
Council
 
considers
 
the
 
donor’s
 
expectations
 
and
 
co-creates
 
the
 
design
 
and
 
strategy
 
for
 
the
 
study.
 
However,
 
we
 
have
 
not
 
encountered
 
an
 
instance
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
compromise
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁndings.
 
The
 
objectivity
 
in
 
research
 
is
 
of
 
higher
 
order
 
to
 
the
 
expectations
 
of
 
the
 
funding
 
institution.
 
The
 
Council,
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
was
 
viewed
 
by
 
a
 
subset
 
of
 
funders
 
as
 
being
 
dependent
 
on
 
the
 
government
 
for
 
obtaining
 
FCRA
 
approval
 
which
 
complicated
 
its
 
positioning
 
as
 
being
 
independent
 
and
 
might
 
threaten
 
the
 
long-term
 
sustainability
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
 
Three
 
donors
 
expressed
 
this
 
perception.
  
 
An
 
integrated
 
domain
 
approach
 
in
 
research
 
demands
 
an
 
immense
 
understanding
 
of
 
various
 
domains
 
and
 
functions.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
sector
 
is
 
complex,
 
understanding
 
the
 
true
 
extent
 
of
 
needs
 
and
 
staying
 
adept
 
at
 
emerging
 
needs
 
and
 
markets
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
take
 
an
 
integrated
 
and
 
intersectional
 
approach.
 
One
 
example
 
highlighted
 
by
 
the
 
donor
 
was
 
the
 
Powering
 
Livelihoods
 
initiative,
 
which
 
takes
 
an
 
integrated
 
approach
 
by
 
converging
 
multi-sectoral
 
issues,
 
solution
 
hypotheses
 
and
 
modelling
 
for
 
scale.
 
 
Integration
 
should
 
be
 
a
 
key
 
component
 
of
 
The
 
Council’s
 
work
 
and
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
any
 
think
 
tank’s
 
strategy.
 
The
 
Powering
 
Livelihoods
 
programme,
 
where
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
the
 
lead
 
knowledge
 
partner,
 
has
 
a
 
holistic
 
strategy
 
focused
 
on
 
the
 
integrated
 
climate
 
and
 
livelihood
 
sector
 
outcomes.

With
 
strong
 
values
 
and
 
perceptions
 
imbibed
 
by
 
The
 
Council,
 
numerous
 
counterarguments
 
have
 
been
 
shared
 
by
 
the
 
donors.
 
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
orchestrated
 
and
 
executed
 
high-quality
 
work
 
using
 
original
 
data
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
decade.
 
Three
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
often
 
claims
 
attribution
 
to
 
the
 
outcome
 
or
 
impact
 
of
 
various
 
policy
 
decisions
 
and
 
sectoral
 
inﬂuences.
 
The
 
donor
 
cited
 
articles,
 
op-eds,
 
and
 
social
 
media
 
posts
 
where
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
overtly
 
acknowledged
 
and
 
taken
 
credit
 
during
 
instances
 
such
 
as
 
India’s
 
commitment
 
to
 
net
 
zero,
 
the
 
successful
 
creation
 
of
 
the
 
International
 
Solar
 
Alliance,
 
etc.
 
 
The
 
donors
 
further
 
highlighted
 
that
 
the
 
trend
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
institution
 
in
 
the
 
public
 
space,
 
but
 
also
 
by
 
members
 
using
 
social
 
media
 
to
 
attribute
 
successes
 
to
 
themselves.
  
 
The
 
Council
 
tries
 
to
 
project
 
their
 
contribution
 
as
 
attribution
 
in
 
many
 
instances.
 
One
 
recent
 
example
 
would
 
be
 
during
 
the
 
COP-26
 
summit,
 
when
 
Honourable
 
Prime
 
Minister
 
Narendra
 
Modi
 
announced
 
India’s
 
Net
 
Zero
 
Commitment
 
and
 
an
 
action
 
plan
 
for
 
the
 
target
 
year,
 
2070;
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
many
 
claimants
 
to
 
contend
 
how
 
various
 
pieces
 
of
 
their
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
sector,
 
their
 
contributions
 
in
 
the
 
steering
 
committees
 
etc.
 
have
 
been
 
directly
 
responsible
 
for
 
India’s
 
stance.
 
It
 
came
 
from
 
their
 
CEO’s
 
handle.
 
This
 
approach
 
is
 
something
 
The
 
Council
 
must
 
reﬂect
 
upon.
 
Not
 
every
 
statement
 
by
 
the
 
government
 
and
 
recent
 
trend
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
cross-validated
 
from
 
their
 
platforms
 
and
 
claimed
 
credit.
 
The
 
perception
 
of
 
claiming
 
attribution
 
larger
 
than
 
the
 
proportionate
 
share
 
was
 
of
 
three
 
prominent
 
donors
 
who
 
scored
 
high
 
across
 
the
 
criteria
 
deﬁned
 
earlier
.
 
A
 
few
 
other
 
donors
 
did
 
mention
 
this
 
in
 
passing
 
but
 
did
 
not
 
highlight
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
key
 
issue.
  
 
A
 
Donor’s
 
Voice
 
The
 
Donor’s
 
Proﬁle
 
Independent
 
philanthropy
 
that
 
aims
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
lives
 
of
 
vulnerable
 
groups.
 
Keeping
 
sustainability
 
at
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
everything,
 
they
 
have
 
continued
 
to
 
provide
 
philanthropic
 
leadership
 
and
 
build
 
deeper
 
collaborations
 
with
 
funding
 
partners.
 
Climate
 
Change
 
remains
 
key
 
to
 
their
 
work,
 
and
 
they
 
are
 
currently
 
working
 
with
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
organisations
 
to
 
scale
 
up
 
climate
 
action.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
growing
 
climate
 
portfolio
 
in
 
India.
 
 
The
 
Donor’s
 
perceptions
 
The
 
donor
 
acknowledged
 
and
 
highlighted
 
the
 
remarkable
 
expansion
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
of
 
climate
 
change
 
and
 
the
 
appetite
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
conceive
 
and
 
approach
 
complex
 
climate
 
issues
 
and
 
pursue
 
research
 
and
 
advocacy
 
in
 
innovative,
 
integrated
 
ﬁelds
 
under
 
climate
 
change
 
effectively.
 
The
 
donor
 
considered
 
The
 
Council’s
 
vision
 
cohesive
 
throughout
 
their
 
interaction
 
and
 
saw
 
the
 
potential
 
of
 
them
 
developing
 
into
 
a
 
global
 
think
 
tank.
 
The
 
Council's
 
rise
 
as
 
a
 
sector-shaping
 
think
 
tank,
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
diversify
 
their
 
funding
 
sources,
 
their
 
fundraising
 
strategy,
 
and
 
their
 
need
 
to
 
raise
 
more
 
money
 
for
 
institution
 
and
 
capacity
 
development
 
are
 
all
 
perceived
 
by
 
donors.
 
Instead
 
of
 
relying
 
only
 
on
 
foreign,
 
grant-based
 
sources
 
of
 
income,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
think
 
tank
 
utilising
 
domestic
 
funding
 
opportunities
 
through
 
collaboration
 
with
 
local
 
governments
 
and
 
local
 
CSR
 
funds.
 
The
 
Council,
 
in
 
this
 
regard
 
can
 
learn
 
from
 
organisations
 
like
 
DA
 
and
 
TERI,
 
for
 
whom
 
a
 
diversiﬁed
 
funding
 
approach
 
assisted
 
in
 
pursuing
 
ﬁnancial
 
sustainability.
 
However,
 
learning
 
what
 
funding
 
approach
 
works
 
38
 


 
for
 
think
 
tanks
 
came
 
with
 
decades
 
of
 
experience
 
and
 
experimentation.
 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
The
 
Council,
 
early
 
adoption
 
of
 
various
 
ﬁnancial
 
instruments,
 
product
 
and
 
service-driven
 
strategies
 
can
 
assist
 
achieving
 
ﬁnancial
 
autonomy
 
and
 
bring
 
stability
 
to
 
their
 
growth.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
donor
 
recommended
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
should
 
develop
 
a
 
sustainable
 
growth
 
strategy
 
that
 
would
 
allow
 
geographical
 
and
 
partnership
 
decentralisation
 
as
 
opposed
 
to
 
coming
 
across
 
as
 
a
 
Delhi-centric
 
think
 
tank
 
working
 
mostly
 
at
 
the
 
national
 
level.
 
This
 
approach
 
would
 
allow
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
deepen
 
its
 
impact
 
within
 
India
 
while
 
deepening
 
the
 
current
 
strategy
 
to
 
work
 
towards
 
an
 
outward-facing
 
global
 
positioning.
 
The
 
donor
 
opined
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
should
 
facilitate
 
the
 
assimilation
 
of
 
their
 
ideas
 
and
 
expertise
 
across
 
the
 
country
 
and
 
increase
 
awareness
 
about
 
their
 
function
 
and
 
role.
 
It
 
was
 
highlighted
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
lacked
 
the
 
desire
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
collaborative
 
working
 
relationship
 
with
 
other
 
think
 
tanks
 
and
 
institutions
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
of
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability.
 
As
 
a
 
pragmatic
 
way
 
forward,
 
the
 
donor
 
suggested
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
prioritise
 
their
 
work
 
through
 
an
 
inclusive,
 
collaborative
 
approach.
 
Our
 
ﬁrst
 
conversation
 
with
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
was
 
more
 
centred
 
on
 
his
 
success
 
and
 
achievements
 
and
 
provided
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
little
 
scope
 
for
 
growth
 
inside
 
the
 
organisation.
 
The
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leadership
 
is
 
too
 
reliant
 
on
 
Dr
 
Arunabha.
 
They
 
need
 
to
 
create
 
opportunities
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
round
 
of
 
leaders.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
human
 
resource
 
at
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
regarded
 
as
 
highly
 
competent
 
and
 
exhibited
 
analytical
 
skills
 
with
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
conduct
 
meaningful
 
research
 
in
 
diverse
 
ﬁelds.
 
However,
 
they
 
cited
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
the
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leadership
 
by
 
stating
 
that
 
the
 
organisation’s
 
dependency
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
leader
 
could
 
damage
 
the
 
institutional
 
capacity.
 
Regarding
 
the
 
argument
 
of
 
contribution
 
and
 
attribution,
 
especially
 
in
 
a
 
think
 
tank
 
space,
 
the
 
donor
 
perceived
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
had
 
a
 
general
 
pattern
 
of
 
claiming
 
the
 
credit
 
of
 
high-level
 
success
 
as
 
theirs.
 
They
 
further
 
mentioned
 
that
 
such
 
success
 
stories
 
wear
 
the
 
ﬁngerprints
 
of
 
many
 
hands
 
and
 
would
 
be
 
highly
 
unusual
 
to
 
give
 
credit
 
to
 
a
 
single
 
entity.
 
 
Lastly,
 
the
 
donor
 
noted
 
that
 
being
 
an
 
independent
 
and
 
young
 
organisation,
 
The
 
Council
 
showed
 
massive
 
growth
 
in
 
10
 
years
 
and
 
was
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
few
 
think
 
tanks
 
that
 
displayed
 
high-quality
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
of
 
Climate
 
Change.
 
However,
 
they
 
pointed
 
out
 
that
 
The
 
Council’s
 
views
 
were
 
often
 
dictated
 
by
 
the
 
government’s
 
concerns
 
and
 
were
 
prone
 
to
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
opinions
 
of
 
the
 
ministry/government
 
bodies.
 
They
 
suggested
 
that
 
being
 
an
 
independent
 
organisation,
 
their
 
work
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
focused
 
on
 
projects
 
the
 
real-world
 
faces,
 
offering
 
an
 
unbiased
 
and
 
independent
 
perspective.

desirable

amongst
 
the
 
key
 
decision
 
makers.
 
The
 
key
 
driving
 
factors
 
in
 
the
 
sectoral
 
positioning
 
are
  
 
1.
 
Independence
 
from
 
the
 
geo-political
 
domain
 
inﬂuences
 
actors
 
and
 
stakeholders.
 
2.
 
Relationships
 
and

and

overarching

and

without
 
losing
 
the

Hence,
 
capturing
 
the
 
positive
 
and
 
negative
 
perceptions
 
and
 
sentiments
 
around
 
the
 
positioning
 
of
 
the
 
think
 
tank
 
from
 
multiple
 
perspectives
 
across
 
the
 
factors
 
mentioned
 
above
 
is
 
critical.
 
 
 
Reiterating
 
a
 
few
 
perceptions
 
from
 
the
 
previous
 
segments,
 
independence
 
across
 
various
 
actors
 
in
 
the
 
ecosystem
 
had
 
mixed
 
perceptions.
 
Common
 
perceptions
 
from
 
the
 
donors
 
were
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
exhibited
 
a
 
high
 
degree
 
of
 
independence
 
in
 
conducting
 
the
 
research
 
and
 
advocating
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
and
 
interpretations.
 
Regarding
 
communication
 
of
 
the
 
outputs,
 
some
 
donors
 
acknowledged
 
that
 
while
 
The
 
Council
 
adjusted
 
their
 
strategy
 
to
 
meet
 
donor
 
expectations,
 
they
 
did
 
not
 
compromise
 
on
 
the
 
true
 
ﬁndings
 
of
 
the
 
sectors,
 
thus
 
maintaining
 
their
 
ambitious
 
standards
 
and
 
values
 
of
 
research
 
and
 
integrity.
 
 
Experts
 
and
 
donors
 
also
 
perceived
 
that
 
the
 
communication
 
strategy
 
leaned
 
toward
 
the
 
elite
 
within
 
the
 
sector.
 
By
 
not
 
engaging
 
adequately
 
with
 
practitioners
 
and
 
populations
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
leverage
 
communication
 
as
 
a
 
change
 
lever
 
is
 
weakened.

The
 
facets
 
of
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
local
 
and
 
national
 
governments,
 
navigating
 
the
 
geo-political
 
inﬂuences
 
effectively
 
etc.,
 
are
 
perceived
 
as
 
traits
 
that
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
getting
 
institutionalised,
 
and
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
Ghosh
 
as
 
a
 
leader,
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
great
 
exemplar.
 
Donors
 
also
 
said
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
possess
 
great
 
power
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
ecosystem
 
in
 
promoting
 
and
 
disseminating
 
their
 
products,
 
such
 
as
 
reports
 
and
 
articles
 
and
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
their
 
communication
 
on
 
social
 
media
 
platforms.
 
However,
 
on
 
the
 
contrary,
 
a
 
subset
 
of
 
donors
 
(25%
 
of
 
the
 
responded
 
sample)
 
also
 
perceived
 
that
 
The
 
Council,
 
during
 
convenings,
 
events
 
and
 
policy
 
dialogues,
 
become
 
over-reliant
 
on
 
the
 
government
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
other
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
in
 
the
 
government
 
system.
 
Sometimes,
 
the
 
convenings
 
extended
 
to
 
voicing
 
government
 
opinions
 
and
 
prioritise
 
issues
 
which
 
were
 
seen
 
as
 
important
 
for
 
the
 
government
 
as
 
well.
 
With
 
independence
 
as
 
a
 
value,
 
such
 
behaviour
 
could
 
be
 
interpreted
 
as
 
a
 
bias.
 
 
The
 
Council's
 
position
 
is
 
hard-lined,
 
like
 
the
 
government,
 
and
 
as
 
an
 
independent
 
think
 
tank,
 
they
 
should
 
desist
 
from
 
merely
 
being
 
a
 
voice
 
of
 
the
 
government.
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
well
 
positioned
 
to
 
underline
 
India’s
 
strengths
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
growth.
 
They
 
possess
 
a
 
fantastic
 
opportunity
 
to
 
move
 
ahead
 
rather
 
than
 
getting
 
bogged
 
down
 
by
 
their
 
close
 
associations
 
with
 
the
 
government
 
entities
 
and
 
their
 
opinions.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
narrative
 
to
 
The
 
Council’s
 
recent
 
highlighted
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
space.
 
If
 
you
 
closely
 
observe
 
the
 
communication
 
around
 
the
 
Kigali
 
Amendment
 
and
 
work
 
on
 
the
 
hydrogen
 
markets,
 
the
 
narrative
 
deviates
 
from
 
the
 
actual
 
sectoral
 
needs
 
to
 
what
 
ﬂoats
 
with
 
the
 
geo-political
 
narrative
 
or
 
the
 
current
 
trend.
 
Such
 
priorities
 
derail
 
the
 
focus
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
as
 
a
 
research
 
think
 
tank
 
and
 
its
 
accurate
 
positioning.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
their
 
capacities
 
are
 
visibly
 
getting
 
stretched.
 
This
 
is
 
more
 
of
 
a
 
bandwagon
 
approach
 
rather
 
than
 
strategic
 
positioning.
 
Donors
 
also
 
highlighted
 
the
 
sectoral
 
capital
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
possesses
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
stakeholders
 
globally
 
and
 
nationally.
 
This
 
virtue
 
serves
 
as
 
a
 
driving
 
factor
 
for
 
global
 
philanthropies
 
and
 
funding
 
institutions
 
focusing
 
on
 
India
 
as
 
a
 
market,
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
sector.
 
Given
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
intends
 
to
 
expand
 
its
 
footprints
 
globally,
 
the
 
donors
 
recommended
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
must
 
increase
 
its
 
positioning
 
strategy
 
and
 
build
 
traction
 
on
 
its
 
international
 
participation
 
in
 
global
 
events
 
and
 
conferences.
 
Some
 
argued
 
that
 
since
 
India
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
market
 
in
 
the
 
Climate
 
Change
 
sector,
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
adaptation
 
and
 
mitigation,
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
ideally
 
equipped
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
frontrunner
 
in
 
this
 
domain
 
and
 
had
 
an
 
edge
 
in
 
attracting
 
global
 
funders
 
keen
 
on
 
India
 
as
 
a
 
market.
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
highlighted
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
strong
 
ties
 
with
 
major
 
stakeholders
 
in
 
the
 
energy
 
sector
 
and
 
might
 
become
 
champions
 
in
 
representing
 
India
 
rather
 
than
 
operating
 
on
 
a
 
global
 
scale.
 
 
Adding
 
to
 
the
 
perception,
 
since
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
amount
 
of
 
traction
 
from
 
The
 
Council
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
the
 
national,
 
and
 
sub-national
 
level
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
local
 
governments,
 
the
 
expectation
 
from
 
donors
 
is
 
to
 
venture
 
into
 
actioning
 
the
 
research
 
on-ground
 
through
 
collaboration
 
and
 
taking
 
the
 
good
 
practices
 
and
 
experience
 
to
 
the
 
global
 
arena
 
with
 
the
 
expansion
 
strategy
 
in
 
mind.

As
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
thought

lever,
 
The
 
Council
 
brings
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of
 
stakeholders
 
onto
 
a
 
single
 
page
 
and
 
develops
 
consensus,
 
translates
 
great
 
ideas
 
into
 
action,
 
ensures
 
uptake
 
of
 
ideas
 
by
 
decision-makers,
 
and
 
leads
 
vital
 
debate
 
amongst
 
civil

Funding
 
and
 
grant-making
 
expectations
 
FCRA
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
cornerstone
 
law
 
the
 
donors
 
and
 
grant-making
 
agencies
 
emphasised
 
regarding
 
how
 
their
 
grant-making
 
process
 
is
 
governed
 
by
 
regulating
 
non-proﬁts
 
and
 
grantee
 
organisations
 
in
 
India
 
for
 
receiving
 
funding.
 
 
Post
 
the
 
FCRA
 
Act
 
implementation,
 
regranting
 
to
 
The
 
Council
 
through
 
other
 
organisations
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
a
 
viable
 
option.
 
The
 
intention
 
was
 
to
 
have
 
minimum
 
paperwork
 
and
 
transfer
 
the
 
onus
 
into
 
the
 
hands
 
of
 
the
 
aggregator.
 
However,
 
post
 
the
 
Act,
 
we
 
have
 
transformed
 
to
 
funding
 
them
 
directly.
 
Donors
 
who
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
were
 
distributed
 
across
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
funding
 
strategies
 
they
 
preferred.
 
A
 
subset
 
of
 
donors
 
had
 
clear
 
preferences
 
of
 
funding
 
pledged
 
to
 
research
 
and
 
evidence
 
generation.
 
Some
 
donors
 
did
 
choose
 
to
 
provide
 
untied
 
grants
 
allowing
 
ﬂexibility
 
for
 
the
 
grantee
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
across
 
the
 
programme
 
or
 
their
 
initiatives.
 
 
Donors
 
highlighted
 
the
 
diversity
 
and
 
relevance
 
of
 
services
 
offered
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
perceived
 
them
 
as
 
the
 
sector
 
leading
 
think
 
tank
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
sector
 
at
 
this
 
time.
 
When
 
nudged
 
to
 
elaborate
 
on
 
the
 
cost-effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
services
 
provided
 
or
 
the
 
value
 
for
 
funding,
 
nothing
 
speciﬁcally
 
was
 
highlighted
 
by
 
the
 
donors
 
despite
 
ongoing
 
or
 
past
 
engagements.
 
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
traits
 
the
 
donors
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
in
 
grantees
 
is
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
be
 
initiative-taking
 
in
 
suggesting
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
fund
 
utilisation
 
and
 
avenues
 
for
 
ﬂexibility
 
across
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
of
 
policy
 
research.
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
often
 
perceived
 
to
 
consider
 
the
 
donor’s
 
suggestions
 
and
 
adjust
 
their
 
strategy
 
per
 
the
 
donor’s
 
needs.
 
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
perceived
 
to
 
follow
 
a
 
good
 
model
 
and
 
process
 
of
 
engaging
 
with
 
the
 
donors.
 
Instead
 
of
 
pursuing
 
many
 
donors
 
transactionally
 
at
 
merely
 
a
 
project
 
level,
 
like-minded
 
donors
 
were
 
frequently
 
strategically
 
engaged.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
engaging
 
with
 
The
 
Council,
 
all
 
the
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
that
 
the
 
administrative
 
processes
 
(legal
 
document
 
vetting,
 
processing
 
of
 
invoices
 
etc.)
 
could
 
be
 
improved,
 
with
 
the
 
time
 
taken
 
being
 
the
 
common
 
complaint.
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
shared
 
strong
 
views
 
on
 
the
 
grant-making
 
process.
 
They
 
suggested
 
that
 
incorporating
 
a
 
fundraising
 
team
 
would
 
be
 
helpful
 
given
 
that
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
instances
 
of
 
grants
 
or
 
programmes
 
is
 
increasing,
 
and
 
managing
 
multiple
 
long-term
 
budgets
 
becomes
 
critical.
 
The
 
senior
 
researcher,
 
as
 
a
 
key
 
account
 
manager,
 
might
 
not
 
be
 
self-sufﬁcient.
 
 
As
 
a
 
philanthropic
 
organisation,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
clear
 
strategy
 
that
 
deﬁnes
 
fund
 
allocation
 
only
 
for
 
programmatic
 
funds.
 
There
 
are
 
no
 
provisions
 
for
 
institution
 
or
 
core
 
funding.
 
Also,
 
the
 
administrative
 
component
 
of
 
the
 
funds
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
capped
 
at
 
20%,
 
which
 
provides
 
limited
 
independence
 
to
 
the
 
grantees.
 
Even
 
when
 
a
 
grantee
 
receives
 
successive
 
funding
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
programme
 
or
 
a
 
new
 
programme,
 
the
 
laws
 
and
 
regulations
 
governed
 
by
 
our
 
strategy
 
do
 
not
 
provide
 
additional
 
ﬂexibility
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
granting.

The
 
Council
 
takes
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
sign
 
agreements
 
and
 
the
 
engagement
 
processes.
 
Their
 
due
 
diligence
 
and
 
legal
 
processes
 
are
 
vital,
 
but
 
the
 
processes
 
are
 
repetitive.
 
If
 
they
 
still
 
partner
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
grant-making
 
agency,
 
the
 
process
 
does
 
not
 
necessarily
 
need
 
to
 
start
 
from
 
nothing.
 
A
 
resolute
 
fundraising
 
team
 
and
 
an
 
administrative
 
guideline
 
can
 
be
 
helpful
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
programmatic
 
teams
 
engaging
 
with
 
us.
 
Regarding
 
the
 
fundraising
 
strategy,
 
the
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
the
 
gap
 
in
 
The
 
Council’s
 
strategy
 
to
 
build
 
alternative
 
business
 
models
 
and
 
offer
 
diverse
 
value
 
propositions
 
such
 
as
 
syndicating
 
their
 
research
 
outputs,
 
frameworks,
 
tools
 
etc.
 
The
 
think
 
tank’s
 
reliance
 
on
 
foreign
 
funding,
 
especially
 
philanthropies
 
and
 
foundations,
 
is
 
currently
 
high.
 
As
 
a
 
recommendation,
 
it
 
was
 
highlighted
 
that
 
focussing
 
on
 
diversiﬁed
 
approaches
 
for
 
engagement
 
and
 
offering
 
new
 
services
 
(policy
 
to
 
action
 
research,
 
incubating
 
and
 
implementing
 
sectoral
 
solutions
 
etc.)
 
can
 
help
 
widen
 
the
 
current
 
fundraising
 
paradigm.

Key
 
Takeaways:
 
 
The
 
discussions
 
between
 
the
 
donors
 
and
 
The
 
Council
 
presented
 
the
 
following
 
takeaways.
 
The
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
think
 
tank
 
and
 
how
 
the
 
values
 
and
 
principles
 
are
 
imbibed
 
into
 
their
 
work
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
the
 
positioning
 
of
 
the
 
sector
 
a.
 
The
 
needs
 
vary
 
across
 
a
 
spectrum
 
for
 
a
 
conventional
 
research
 
consulting
 
organisation
 
versus
 
an
 
academically
 
inclined
 
and
 
socially
 
engaging
 
think
 
tank.
 
b.
 
Values
 
such
 
as
 
independence
 
are
 
critical
 
for
 
a
 
think
 
tank
 
that
 
is
 
more
 
socially
 
engaging.
 
c.
 
Upholding
 
the
 
values
 
such
 
as
 
independence
 
comes
 
at
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
positioning
 
while
 
engaging
 
consistently
 
with
 
national
 
and
 
local
 
governments.
 
 
d.
 
International
 
donors
 
and
 
grant-making
 
organisations
 
prioritise
 
think
 
tanks
 
practising
 
the
 
principles
 
such
 
as
 
gender
 
equity
 
and
 
sustained
 
staff
 
wellbeing
 
indicators.
 
However,
 
think
 
tanks
 
ﬁrst
 
need
 
core
 
funding
 
for
 
leadership
 
and
 
institutional
 
development,
 
before
 
they
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
gender
 
equity
 
and
 
staff
 
well-being.
 
 
e.
 
Focus
 
on
 
sector-shaping
 
research,
 
the
 
ability
 
of
 
the
 
think
 
tank
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
donors
 
into
 
investing
 
in
 
sectoral
 
needs
 
and
 
gaps.
 
Strengthening
 
the
 
quality
 
control
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
processes
 
for
 
better
 
aggregating
 
sectoral
 
goods.
 
2.
 
With
 
modest
 
funding
 
needs,
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
eventually
 
looking
 
for
 
a
 
core
 
grant
 
and
 
institutional
 
grant
 
approach
 
to
 
support
 
a.
 
Positioning
 
The
 
Council
 
as
 
a
 
sectoral
 
thought
 
leader
 
by
 
facilitating
 
evidence
 
and
 
information
 
to
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
decision-makers
 
to
 
help
 
orchestrate
 
solutions
 
for
 
the
 
critical
 
sectoral
 
issues.
 
 
b.
 
Institutional
 
development
 
and
 
capacity
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
human
 
capital.
 
c.
 
Bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
in
 
information
 
and
 
knowledge
 
to
 
sustain
 
sector
 
shaping
 
research
 
before
 
the
 
issues
 
and
 
solutions
 
are
 
funding
 
ready.
 
d.
 
Improving
 
the
 
levers
 
and
 
actors
 
from
 
policy
 
recommendations
 
to
 
policy
 
change
 
or
 
action
 
(needs
 
system
 
strengthening).
 
 
3.
 
Long-term
 
core
 
grants
 
with
 
an
 
institutional
 
funding
 
component
 
are
 
essential
 
for
 
The
 
Council.
 
This
 
will
 
develop
 
institutional
 
strength
 
and
 
resilience,
 
including
 
governance
 
and
 
leadership
 
development,
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
focussing
 
on
 
widening
 
the
 
research
 
portfolios,
 
enabler
 
functions
 
such
 
as
 
communications
 
and
 
PR
 
 
4.
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
set
 
on
 
a
 
path
 
targeted
 
for
 
expanding
 
access
 
to
 
untied/unrestricted
 
funds
 
and
 
diversiﬁcation
 
of
 
funding
 
to
 
ensure
 
institutional
 
sustainability
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence.
 
Insights
 
converging
 
from
 
the
 
conversations
 
with
 
donors
 
indicate
 
that
 
the
 
transition
 
towards
 
syndicating
 
research,
 
creation
 
of
 
core
 
products
 
(that
 
could
 
be
 
replicated
 
across
 
domains
 
and
 
functions,
 
mobilisation
 
of
 
local
 
philanthropy,
 
syndication
 
of
 
academia,
 
training,
 
and
 
technical
 
support
 
etc.)
 
are
 
vital
 
services
 
and
 
business
 
models
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
focus
 
upon
 
going
 
forward.

Quality
 
of

To

the

of

Interacting
 
with
 
the
 
various
 
donor
 
agencies
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
revealed
 
that
 
a
 
good
 
mix
 
of
 
sector-strategic
 
donors
 
was
 
actively
 
engaged,
 
highlighting
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
engagement
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
being
 
created
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
 
Given
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
donors
 
being
 
engaged
 
and
 
the
 
variety
 
in
 
the
 
programmes
 
and
 
resources,
 
the
 
perceptions
 
about
 
the
 
engagement
 
and
 
partnership
 
strategy
 
were
 
inﬂuenced
 
by
 
several
 
factors.
 
Overall,
 
The
 
Council’s
 
engagement
 
strategy
 
was
 
deemed
 
competitive
 
and
 
highly
 
competent,
 
though
 
each
 
donor
 
had
 
a
 
unique
 
perspective
 
on
 
the
 
engagement
 
model
 
adopted
 
by
 
The
 
Council.
 
The
 
council
 
was
 
proactive,
 
considered
 
the
 
views
 
of
 
multiple
 
stakeholders
 
under
 
the
 
programme,
 
and
 
integrated
 
the
 
insights
 
to
 
alter
 
their
 
operational
 
strategy.
 
Donors
 
highlighted
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
able
 
to
 
add
 
signiﬁcant
 
value
 
to
 
each
 
of
 
their
 
partnerships.
 
 
The
 
following
 
characteristics
 
were
 
recognised
 
and
 
appreciated:
 
 
●
 
The
 
ability
 
to
 
network
 
and
 
convene
 
key
 
stakeholders,
 
 
●
 
Engaging
 
diverse
 
clientele,
 
stakeholders,
 
and
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
subject
 
matter
 
experts
 
in
 
critical
 
discussions,
 
 
●
 
The
 
ability
 
to
 
constitute
 
and
 
deliver
 
logical
 
and
 
powerful
 
research
 
hypotheses,
 
 
●
 
The
 
ability
 
to
 
foster
 
sector-shaping
 
discussions,
 
 
●
 
Assistance
 
in
 
re-strategizing
 
their
 
investments
 
and
 
disseminating
 
funds.
 
 
In
 
summation,
 
The
 
Council’s
 
credibility,
 
technical
 
knowledge,
 
and
 
capacity
 
to
 
do
 
advocacy
 
and
 
networking,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
its
 
ability
 
to
 
hold
 
convening,
 
were
 
identiﬁed
 
as
 
key
 
strengths
 
that
 
foster
 
effective
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
donor
 
communities
 
and
 
the
 
sector.
 
All
 
donors
 
unanimously
 
identiﬁed
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
research
 
and
 
networking
 
as
 
the
 
top
 
strengths
 
of
 
The
 
Council.

A
 
donor
 
motivated
 
by
 
SDG
 
13
 
fuelled
 
the
 
vision
 
of
 
a
 
sustainable
 
world,
 
focusing
 
on
 
mitigation
 
programmes
 
under
 
climate
 
change.
 
They
 
support
 
the
 
design
 
and
 
development
 
of
 
robust
 
and
 
practical
 
policy
 
solutions
 
that
 
promote
 
climate
 
action.
 
Additionally,
 
they
 
seek
 
to
 
inspire
 
ideas
 
for
 
expansive,
 
highly
 
effective
 
policy
 
responses
 
to
 
India’s
 
climate
 
concerns.
 
 
The
 
Donors’
 
perceptions
 
The
 
rapid
 
growth
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
the
 
energy
 
and
 
climate
 
change
 
sector
 
was
 
perceived
 
as
 
the
 
most
 
valued
 
strength
 
by
 
the
 
donor.
 
They
 
considered
 
high
 
ambition
 
the
 
propelling
 
factor
 
in
 
becoming
 
a
 
prominent
 
organisation
 
in
 
a
 
brief
 
time.
 
The
 
donor
 
raised
 
the
 
concern
 
that
 
due
 
to
 
46
 


 
the
 
Council’s
 
fast
 
expansion;
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
its
 
deliverables
 
has
 
suffered.
 
They
 
stressed
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
depth
 
in
 
the
 
reports
 
published
 
as
 
well.
 
 
The
 
donor
 
praised
 
The
 
Council's
 
capacity
 
to
 
curate
 
and
 
host
 
insightful
 
sessions
 
as
 
a
 
key
 
strength.
 
They
 
also
 
expressed
 
their
 
satisfaction
 
with
 
their
 
overall
 
reporting
 
and
 
delivery
 
system.
 
They
 
acknowledged
 
the
 
contributions
 
made
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
in
 
the
 
policy
 
space
 
and
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
generate
 
evidence-based
 
knowledge.
 
 
They
 
voiced
 
their
 
concerns
 
about
 
The
 
Council’s
 
reluctance
 
to
 
collaborate
 
with
 
other
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
Additionally,
 
they
 
claimed
 
that
 
the
 
institution’s
 
self-projection
 
was
 
evident,
 
which
 
occasionally
 
created
 
a
 
perception
 
that
 
institutional
 
development
 
was
 
more
 
important
 
than
 
the
 
policy
 
issues
 
they
 
were
 
attempting
 
to
 
address.
 
 
The
 
donors
 
cited
 
a
 
few
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
as
 
being
 
essential
 
for
 
sustained
 
funding.
 
They
 
placed
 
a
 
strong
 
emphasis
 
on
 
the
 
calibre
 
of
 
the
 
think
 
tank’s
 
research
 
(number
 
of
 
peer-reviewed
 
publications;
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
policy
 
inﬂuences
 
etc.)
 
and
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
a
 
precise
 
set
 
of
 
objectives
 
detailing
 
what
 
they
 
aspire
 
to
 
accomplish
 
(Vision
 
2030
 
and
 
the
 
contribution
 
to
 
SDG
 
&amp;
 
Climate
 
goals).
 
Additionally,
 
they
 
stated
 
that
 
the
 
funder
 
did
 
not
 
consider
 
awards
 
or
 
think
 
tanks’
 
ranking
 
in
 
a
 
global
 
index
 
as
 
an
 
important
 
parameter
 
while
 
evaluating.
 
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
leadership,
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
is
 
regarded
 
as
 
a
 
strong,
 
competent
 
leader
 
with
 
a
 
solid
 
grasp
 
of
 
the
 
political
 
environment.
 
The
 
donor
 
stressed
 
the
 
clear
 
disconnect
 
between
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
and
 
the
 
second
 
level
 
of
 
leadership,
 
indicating
 
a
 
dearth
 
of
 
leadership
 
abilities
 
there.
 
The
 
donor
 
emphasised
 
the
 
necessity
 
for
 
developing
 
the
 
next
 
generation
 
of
 
leaders
 
for
 
the
 
institution
 
to
 
ﬂourish
 
successfully
 
and
 
sustainably.

Dr
 
Arunabha’s
 
social
 
capital
 
is
 
well
 
established
 
in
 
various
 
sections
 
of
 
this
 
report
 
and
 
is
 
a
 
catalyst
 
for
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
The
 
Council’s
 
networking
 
and
 
convening
 
efforts
 
for
 
effective
 
policy
 
dialogue.
 
This
 
positively
 
correlates
 
with
 
improving
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
think
 
tank’s
 
advocacy
 
and
 
dissemination
 
levers.
 
From
 
the
 
perception
 
of
 
the
 
donors,
 
The
 
Council’s
 
social
 
capital
 
has
 
a
 
domino
 
effect
 
on
 
inﬂuencing
 
the
 
policymaking
 
and
 
the
 
decision-making
 
levers.

The
 
Council’s
 
social
 
capital
 
was
 
perceived
 
to
 
be
 
highly
 
sustainable,
 
i.e.,
 
consistently
 
key
 
actors
 
and
 
stakeholders
 
(sometimes
 
the
 
same
 
experts;
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
critical
 
for
 
making
 
effective
 
decisions)
 
participate
 
in
 
their
 
policy-oriented
 
research,
 
analysis,
 
and
 
dissemination.
 
 
From
 
the
 
donors’
 
perspective,
 
the
 
possession
 
of
 
inﬂuencing
 
social
 
capital
 
and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
bring
 
the
 
key
 
actors
 
and
 
stakeholders
 
together
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
virtue
 
that
 
guarantees
 
sustained
 
engagement.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
examples
 
highlighted
 
by
 
the
 
donors
 
included
 
 
●
 
the
 
effort
 
of
 
networking
 
in
 
successfully
 
enabling
 
the
 
platform
 
for
 
the
 
International
 
Solar

The
 
Council
 
can
 
be
 
ranked
 
as
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
top
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
regarding
 
its
 
social
 
capital,
 
networking
 
capabilities,
 
and
 
technical
 
knowledge.
 
Their
 
researchers
 
are
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
GOI
 
steering
 
and
 
planning
 
and
 
policy
 
committees,
 
providing
 
key
 
inputs
 
in
 
policymaking
 
and
 
implementation.
 
The
 
Council
 
does
 
possess
 
good
 
inroads
 
with
 
the
 
sector’s
 
policy
 
circle
 
(government),
 
and
 
their
 
research,
 
report
 
and
 
data
 
are
 
credible
 
and
 
are
 
widely
 
accepted
 
by
 
the
 
government
 
and
 
other
 
stakeholders.
 
 
Despite
 
the
 
social
 
capital
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
possesses,
 
donors
 
opined
 
that
 
they
 
lacked
 
the
 
intent
 
to
 
collaborate
 
with
 
their
 
peers
 
or
 
other
 
think
 
tanks
 
within
 
the
 
sector
 
(4
 
donors).
 
While
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
how
 
relationships
 
and
 
partnerships
 
were
 
fostered
 
while
 
allying,
 
it
 
was
 
perceived
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
an
 
underlying
 
discomfort
 
with
 
collaborating
 
or
 
co-creating
 
with
 
peers
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
ecosystem.
 
 
We
 
sometimes
 
felt
 
hostile
 
while
 
collaborating
 
with
 
The
 
Council,
 
especially
 
during
 
policy
 
convenings
 
and
 
dialogues.
 
The
 
Council
 
becomes
 
territorial
 
during
 
the
 
engagement.
 
While
 
trying
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
shared
 
vision,
 
even
 
while
 
we
 
pitch
 
in
 
as
 
an
 
equitable
 
partnership,
 
the
 
same
 
intent
 
will
 
not
 
reciprocate.
 
The
 
ﬂow
 
of
 
intent
 
is
 
often
 
unilateral.
 
 
Perceptions
 
on
 
building
 
partnerships
 
and
 
sustained
 
engagement
 
 
Donors’
 
polar
 
inclinations
 
were
 
noted
 
as
 
they
 
described
 
their
 
partnership
 
sustenance
 
strategy.
 
Five
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
who
 
responded
 
in
 
this
 
regard
 
did
 
not
 
appear
 
to
 
have
 
strict
 
evaluation
 
standards
 
when
 
working
 
with
 
academic
 
institutes
 
or
 
think
 
tanks.
 
To
 
reach
 
a
 
wider
 
audience
 
within
 
the
 
domains
 
of
 
functions,
 
the
 
donors
 
appear
 
to
 
collaborate
 
with
 
several
 
grantee
 
groups.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
spectrum,
 
four
 
donors
 
who
 
responded
 
had
 
clear
 
preferences
 
and
 
perceived
 
the
 
following
 
factors
 
as
 
critical:
 
●
 
Social
 
capital
 
(relationships
 
with
 
the
 
governments,
 
ability
 
to
 
convene
 
key
 
stakeholders),
 
●
 
Diversity
 
of
 
subdomains
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
and
 
sustainability
 
space,
 
 
●
 
National
 
and
 
sub-national
 
presence,
 
quality
 
of
 
research
 
outputs
 
and
 
knowledge
 
pieces
 
and,

●
 
Ability
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
policy
 
making.
 
 
They
 
intended
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
only
 
the
 
pioneering
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
space.
   
 
Considering
 
things
 
from
 
a
 
micro
 
lens,
 
the
 
donors’
 
primary
 
drivers
 
for
 
partnerships
 
and
 
sustained
 
funding
 
approach
 
included
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
●
 
Number
 
of
 
policies
 
convenings
 
in
 
the
 
domain
 
area,
 
 
●
 
Cost-effectiveness
 
of
 
generating
 
evidence
 
and
 
policy
 
outcomes,
 
 
●
 
Total
 
number
 
of
 
studies
 
ongoing/completed
 
in
 
the
 
respective
 
domains
 
of
 
engagement,
 
 
●
 
Ability
 
to
 
sustain
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impact
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
 
What
 
counts
 
as
 
a
 
successful
 
partnership
 
for
 
us
 
is
 
the
 
impact
 
through
 
collaboration
 
we
 
create.
 
Clear,
 
concise,
 
and
 
measurable
 
search
 
and
 
policy
 
study
 
action
 
are
 
critical.
 
From
 
our
 
perspective,
 
The
 
Council
 
does
 
splendid
 
work
 
and
 
follows
 
through
 
with
 
clear
 
action
 
points
 
for
 
the
 
sector.
 
Additionally,
 
they
 
build
 
good
 
relations
 
with
 
the
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
in
 
the
 
ecosystem.
 
Advocacy
 
and
 
action
 
delivery
 
are
 
where
 
they
 
excel.
 
The
 
donors
 
used
 
various
 
tools,
 
modalities,
 
and
 
techniques
 
to
 
fund
 
The
 
Council.
 
Depending
 
upon
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
funders,
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
criteria
 
highlighted
 
by
 
the
 
donors
 
which
 
served
 
as
 
critical
 
factors
 
for
 
ﬁnalising
 
the
 
grantees
 
and
 
factors
 
that
 
fostered
 
a
 
long-term
 
partnership
 
were:
 
●
 
The
 
extent
 
of
 
the
 
sectoral
 
impact,
 
 
●
 
Ability
 
to
 
advocate
 
ﬁndings
 
with
 
diverse
 
stakeholders
 
or
 
policymakers,
 
 
●
 
Incorporation
 
of
 
cross-cutting,
 
intersectional
 
issues,
 
 
●
 
Mitigation
 
of
 
adverse
 
impacts
 
on
 
the
 
environment/human
 
rights,
 
 
●
 
Alignment
 
with
 
the

of
 
the

●
 
Values

A
 
subset
 
of
 
donor
 
institutions
 
expressed
 
an
 
interest
 
in
 
continuing
 
to
 
collaborate
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
becoming
 
a
 
long-term
 
partner.
 
Some
 
donors
 
also
 
indicated
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
expect
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
institution
 
to
 
mature
 
into

their
 
research,
 
collaborating
 
with
 
the
 
CSOs/NGOs
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
models
 
to
 
scale.
 
This
 
could
 
strengthen
 
collaboration
 
and
 
partnership.
 
A
 
few
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
working
 
toward
 
building
 
more
 
bottom-to-top
 
approaches
 
and
 
on-ground
 
action
 
pathways,
 
which
 
they
 
are
 
on
 
the
 
lookout
 
for
 
from
 
their
 
research
 
partner.
 
 
One
 
respondent
 
mentioned
 
alignment
 
with
 
the
 
strategy,
 
such
 
as
 
gender
 
inclusion
 
as
 
a
 
driving
 
factor.
 
The
 
Council
 
needs
 
a
 
coherent
 
organisation-wide
 
strategy
 
and
 
a
 
clear
 
top-down
 
strategy
 
on
 
gender
 
inclusion
 
which
 
shall
 
not
 
be
 
limited
 
to
 
having
 
a
 
few
 
people
 
enthusiastic
 
about
 
working
 
within
 
the
 
sector.

Importance
 
of
 
think
 
tank
 
ratings
 
for
 
donors
 
While
 
evaluating
 
the
 
partners,
 
the
 
donor’s
 
approach
 
had
 
a
 
clear
 
dichotomy.
 
Some
 
donor
 
decisions
 
were
 
based
 
on
 
merit,
 
some
 
on
 
comfort,
 
some
 
on
 
sectoral
 
visibility,
 
and
 
so
 
on.
 
However,
 
this
 
was
 
not
 
a
 
standard
 
practice
 
applied
 
across
 
all
 
decisions
 
by
 
many
 
donors.
 
Even
 
for
 
the
 
institutions
 
chosen
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
excellence,
 
expertise
 
and
 
sectoral
 
position,
 
utilisation
 
of
 
think
 
tank
 
ratings
 
and
 
global
 
rating
 
systems
 
was
 
not
 
of
 
great
 
interest
 
or
 
a
 
point
 
of
 
contention
 
with
 
the
 
donors.
 
Close
 
to
 
40%
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
stated
 
that
 
think
 
tank
 
awards
 
and
 
rankings
 
were
 
not
 
signiﬁcant
 
elements
 
that
 
inﬂuenced
 
their
 
engagement
 
with
 
an
 
agency
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
their
 
experience
 
with
 
the
 
institution.
 
 
Assurance
 
of
 
senior
 
leadership
 
managing
 
the
 
engagement
 
Research
 
portfolio
 
leads
 
and
 
programme
 
leads
 
engaged
 
with
 
donor
 
agencies.
 
This
 
was
 
reported
 
by
 
donors
 
as
 
agreeable
 
since
 
they
 
received
 
adequate
 
downtime
 
with
 
sectoral
 
experts
 
and
 
were
 
assured
 
of
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
outcomes.
 
The
 
ﬁnance
 
team
 
was
 
involved
 
only
 
in
 
accounting,
 
legal
 
and
 
compliance
 
requirements.
 
However,
 
institutionalising
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
good
 
practice
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
building
 
leaders
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
term.
 
Key
 
takeaways
 
1.
 
While
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
a
 
good
 
engagement
 
strategy
 
with
 
the
 
donor
 
communities:
 
a.
 
Sustaining
 
partnerships
 
is
 
highly
 
correlated
 
with
 
the
 
shared
 
value
 
creation
 
potential
 
 
b.
 
Expanding
 
the
 
value
 
proposition
 
and
 
services
 
beyond
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
current
 
offerings
 
requires
 
–
 
 
i.
 
Actioning
 
the
 
research,
 
expanding
 
to
 
policy
 
implementation.
 
 
ii.
 
Co-creating
 
solutions
 
and
 
designs
 
with
 
CSOs/NGOs
 
and
 
implementation
 
organisations.
 
iii.
 
Incubating
 
solutions,
 
creating
 
market-led
 
business
 
cases,
 
and
 
understanding
 
the
 
levers
 
of
 
scale.
 
iv.
 
Involvement
 
in
 
ecosystem-level
 
strengthening
 
such
 
as
 
sectoral
 
capacity
 
development,
 
training,
 
and
 
knowledge
 
management
 
systems.
 
2.
 
To
 
strengthen
 
the
 
partnership
 
levers
 
and
 
leverage
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
networks
 
it
 
is
 
necessary:
 
a.
 
To
 
improve
 
the
 
cohesion
 
of
 
collaborating
 
with
 
the
 
peer
 
institutions
 
and
 
competitive
 
think
 
tanks
 
(4
 
donors)
.
 
 
b.
 
For
 
donors
 
to
 
be
 
open
 
to
 
funding
 
collaboratives
 
with
 
various
 
actors
 
in
 
the
 
system
 
perceived
 
as
 
collaborating
 
for
 
impact.
 
c.
 
To
 
leverage
 
funding
 
for
 
complex
 
and
 
intersectional
 
issues
 
where
 
the
 
risks
 
of
 
failure
 
or
 
inaction
 
are
 
distributed
 
across
 
the
 
collaborating
 
partners.

Institutional
 
capacity
 
development
 
and
 
mitigation
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
person
 
risk
 
a.
 
Reducing
 
the
 
dependency
 
on
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
and
 
certain
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
anchor
 
key
 
relationships
 
(50%
 
of
 
the
 
donors)
.
 
b.
 
Widen
 
and
 
diversify
 
relationships
 
with
 
local
 
donors,
 
local
 
philanthropy,
 
and
 
a
 
healthy
 
second

A
 
foundation
 
with
 
a
 
vision
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
of
 
vulnerable
 
populations.
 
They
 
are
 
dedicated
 
to
 
addressing
 
the
 
underlying
 
causes
 
of
 
poverty
 
and
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
climate
 
change.
 
They
 
have
 
invested
 
in
 
supporting
 
the
 
poorest
 
communities’
 
efforts
 
to
 
cope
 
with
 
and
 
adapt
 
to
 
climate
 
change.
 
 
Donor
 
perception’s
 
 
The
 
donor
 
observed
 
that
 
The
 
Council’s
 
overall
 
structure
 
and
 
values
 
were
 
impressive
 
and
 
appreciated
 
its
 
rapid
 
growth
 
and
 
accomplishments
 
in
 
a
 
brief
 
period.
 
They
 
noted
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
continued
 
to
 
be
 
cost-effective
 
despite
 
establishing
 
itself
 
as
 
a
 
prominent
 
thought
 
leader
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
 
Regarding
 
fostering
 
partnerships,
 
the
 
donor
 
acknowledged
 
The
 
Council’s
 
approach
 
of
 
developing
 
the
 
initial
 
value
 
proposition
 
before
 
approaching
 
like-minded
 
donors
 
to
 
be
 
pragmatic.
 
As
 
a
 
way
 
forward,
 
the
 
donor
 
stressed
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
strengthening
 
this
 
aspect
 
of
 
The
 
Council,
 
which
 
might
 
help
 
in
 
gaining
 
the
 
support
 
of
 
funders.
 
The
 
donor
 
also
 
stated
 
that
 
this
 
created
 
a
 
good
 
working
 
model
 
where
 
the
 
think
 
tanks
 
develop
 
the
 
initial
 
proposition,
 
which
 
is
 
more
 
appealing
 
than
 
designing
 
the
 
programme
 
around
 
the
 
donor
 
proposition.
 
 
CEEW
 
builds
 
the
 
value
 
proposition
 
and
 
reaches
 
out,
 
and
 
ﬁnds
 
synergies
 
with
 
the
 
donor,
 
thus
 
providing
 
an
 
encouraging
 
environment
 
to
 
work
 
and
 
engage.
 
We
 
ﬁnd
 
the
 
proposition
 
more
 
valuable
 
when
 
our
 
marketing
 
team
 
reaches
 
out.
 
Additionally,
 
if
 
the
 
programme
 
or
 
on-the-ground
 
staff
 
offers
 
these
 
value
 
propositions,
 
they
 
become
 
more
 
compelling
 
to
 
receive
 
funding.
 
The
 
donor
 
listed
 
a
 
few
 
elements
 
that
 
would
 
preclude
 
ﬁnancing
 
for
 
a
 
certain
 
think
 
tank.
 
They
 
claimed
 
that
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
industry,
 
many
 
partners
 
or
 
organisations
 
operating
 
in
 
this
 
ﬁeld
 
have
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
amount
 
of
 
overlap
 
in
 
their
 
work
 
areas,
 
which
 
places
 
a
 
great
 
deal
 
of
 
reliance
 
on
 
donors.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
donors
 
are
 
constantly
 
evolving,
 
so
 
if
 
there
 
is
 
an
 
excessive
 
reliance
 
on
 
one
 
group
 
of
 
donors,
 
any
 
abrupt
 
change
 
in
 
grant
 
allocation
 
might
 
jeopardise
 
think
 
tank
 
ﬁnancing.
 
To
 
this,
 
they
 
stressed
 
the
 
necessity
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
emphasise
 
expanding
 
their
 
donor
 
base
 
and
 
not
 
being
 
overly
 
reliant
 
on
 
one
 
source
 
of
 
funding.
 
The
 
donor
 
noted
 
that
 
the
 
research
 
undertaken
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
credible
 
and
 
was
 
widely
 
accepted
 
among
 
government
 
and
 
other
 
stakeholders.
 
They
 
noted
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
were
 
inﬂuential
 
in
 
disseminating
 
their
 
learning
 
and
 
reports
 
and
 
organising
 
convening
 
sessions
 
with
 
high-level
 
stakeholders.
 
They
 
commended
 
them
 
for
 
being
 
initiative-taking
 
in
 
their
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
donor
 
and
 
for
 
being
 
transparent
 
about
 
their
 
work,
 
including
 
sharing
 
insights
 
on
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
encountered
 
during
 
the
 
study.
 
Regarding
 
human
 
capital,
 
the
 
donor
 
considered
 
The
 
Council's
 
human
 
resources
 
as
 
competent.
 
They
 
made
 
a
 
point
 
of
 
highlighting
 
the
 
organisation's
 
high
 
degree
 
of
 
decentralisation
 
and
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
senior
 
management
 
involvement
 
in
 
the
 
programming
 
procedures.
 
They
 
found
 
the
 
second
 
tier
 
of
 
leadership
 
to
 
be
 
empowered
 
to
 
report
 
on
 
their
 
development.
 
The
 
donor
 
recommended
 
decentralisation
 
as
 
a
 
course
 
of
 
action
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
regarding
 
succession
 
planning
 
and
 
scaling
 
up.

While
 
quality
 
measurement
 
is
 
very

some
 
key
 
characteristics
 
highlighted
 
by
 
donors
 
include
 
-
 
 
●
 
Quality
 
and
 
competency
 
of
 
researchers.
 
 
●
 
Infrastructure

and
 
conducting
 
complex

●
 
Quality

●
 
Quality

From
 
the
 
donor’s
 
perspective,
 
the
 
study
 
observed
 
dichotomised
 
opinions
 
on
 
the
 
peer-reviewed
 
publications.
 
Close
 
to
 
50%
 
donors
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
who
 
responded,
 
believed
 
that
 
peer-review
 
publications
 
were
 
the
 
most
 
objective
 
way
 
to
 
measure
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
research,
 
in
 
contrast,
 
others
 
believed
 
that
 
developing
 
workable
 
models
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
or
 
scale
 
from
 
the
 
evidence
 
generated
 
was
 
more
 
important
 
than
 
research
 
publications.
 
 
Donor
 
agencies
 
praised
 
The
 
Council
 
for
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
its
 
convenings
 
and
 
its
 
ability
 
to
 
convene
 
key
 
sectoral
 
stakeholders
 
who
 
could
 
consume
 
the
 
evidence
 
to
 
take
 
forward
 
as
 
action,
 
models
 
to
 
demonstrate

and
 
so
 
on.

space,
 
according
 
to
 
donor
 
suggestions,
 
can
 
elevate
 
the
 
discussion
 
during

and
 
help
 
to
 
create
 
an
 
active
 
evidence
 
exchange
 
network
 
to
 
beneﬁt
 
the
 
sector
 
and
 
the

ecosystem.
 
100%
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
responding
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
perceived
 
a
 
high
 
quality
 
in
 
the
 
Councils'
 
research
 
outputs,
 
presentations
 
(notably
 
visualisations),
 
and
 
network
 
connection
 
(ability
 
to
 
convene
 
adept
 
government
 
stakeholders
 
etc.).
 
Donors
 
attributed
 
The
 
Council's
 
quality
 
function
 
to
 
its
 
agile,
 
young,
 
and
 
vibrant
 
group
 
of
 
researchers,
 
who
 
had
 
the
 
competencies
 
to
 
ideate
 
and
 
conceive
 
complex
 
and
 
sector-aware
 
designs.
  
 
Bright
 
and
 
Intellectual
 
Human
 
Capital
 
The
 
donor
 
community
 
regarded
 
The
 
Council’s
 
competencies
 
and
 
human
 
capital
 
as
 
among
 
the
 
best
 
in
 
the
 
industry.
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
is
 
revered
 
for
 
having
 
created
 
a
 
great
 
platform
 
for
 
young,
 
competent
 
researchers
 
with
 
good
 
analytical
 
and
 
research
 
skills,
 
aiding
 
in
 
creating
 
a
 
reputable
 
brand
 
value
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
decade.
 
The
 
donors
 
commonly
 
believed
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
this
 
exceptional
 
leadership
 
ability
 
that
 
has
 
resulted
 
in
 
the
 
organisation's
 
rapid
 
growth
 
in
 
a
 
brief
 
period.
 
Working
 
with
 
local
 
and
 
national
 
governments,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
effectively
 
navigating
 
geopolitical
 
inﬂuences,
 
are
 
traits
 
that
 
are
 
being
 
institutionalised.
 
The
 
staff
 
of
 
the
 
institution
 
are
 
mirroring
 
the
 
footsteps
 
of
 
their
 
leader,

the
 
potential
 
to
 
follow
 
the
 
same
 
enterprising
 
competency.
 
 
In
 
some
 
instances,
 
team
 
members
 
have
 
displayed
 
a
 
high
 
degree
 
of
 
decentralisation
 
in
 
making
 
decisions
 
at
 
the
 
programmatic
 
level
 
to
 
accelerate
 
the
 
outputs
 
and
 
outcomes.
 
More
 
than
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
responded
 
that
 
the
 
character
 
traits
 
are
 
individual-centric,
 
and
 
whether
 
conscious
 
efforts
 
are
 
made
 
to
 
institutionalise
 
the
 
behaviour
 
is
 
something
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
reﬂect
 
on.

Being
 
a
 
young
 
organisation
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
strength
 
which
 
has
 
enabled
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
ideation
 
and
 
futuristic
 
thought
 
leadership.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
reﬂected
 
on
 
occasions
 
such
 
as
 
proposing
 
a
 
study,
 
shaping
 
sectoral
 
discussions
 
during
 
convenings
 
etc.
 
Over
 
the
 
past
 
decade,
 
being
 
novel,
 
unique,
 
and
 
futuristic
 
has
 
reﬂected
 
in
 
the
 
growth
 
and
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
institution.
 
During
 
meetings,
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
interfaces
 
with
 
key
 
stakeholder
 
groups.
 
While
 
putting
 
out
 
the
 
outreach
 
products,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
diversity
 
of
 
voices
 
other
 
than
 
leaders,
 
which
 
is
 
concentrated
 
on
 
a
 
few
 
core
 
members.
 
To
 
remain
 
an
 
effective
 
think
 
tank
 
in
 
this
 
sector,
 
The
 
Council
 
must
 
invest
 
in
 
human
 
capital
 
and
 
its
 
people,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
institutionalise
 
aspects
 
like
 
advocacy
 
and
 
dissemination.
 
The
 
human
 
capital
 
in
 
the
 
organisation
 
was
 
reported
 
to
 
be
 
well-empowered,
 
energetic,
 
and
 
displayed
 
commendable
 
analytical
 
competencies
 
and
 
diversity,
 
which
 
is
 
much
 
needed
 
in
 
the
 
sector.
 
The
 
approach
 
to
 
talent
 
acquisition
 
and
 
the
 
efforts
 
of
 
the
 
human
 
resources
 
division
 
were
 
praised,
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
was
 
felt
 
during
 
the
 
donor
 
engagement.
 
There
 
were
 
a
 
few
 
noteworthy
 
challenges
 
highlighted
 
by
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
donors.
 
In
 
certain
 
contexts,
 
there
 
were
 
gaps
 
and
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
clarity
 
on
 
people’s
 
designation
 
and
 
their
 
roles.
 
Two
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
that
 
the
 
programme
 
teams
 
were
 
noticeably
 
stretched
 
across
 
multiple
 
projects,
 
which
 
resulted
 
in
 
challenging
 
engagement,
 
and
 
consequently
 
over-burdened
 
with
 
work,
 
displayed
 
fatigue.
 
 
Another
 
instance
 
highlighted
 
by
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
donors
 
pointed
 
toward
 
the
 
internal
 
team
 
cohesion
 
and
 
coordination.
 
During
 
the
 
meetings,
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
instances
 
where
 
a
 
noticeable
 
disconnect
 
was
 
observed
 
between
 
the
 
team
 
members.
 
The
 
root
 
cause
 
of
 
the
 
dissonance
 
arose
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
alignment
 
between
 
the
 
programme
 
and
 
the
 
communications
 
team.
 
The
 
core
 
programmatic
 
team
 
was
 
perceived
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
in
 
control
 
of
 
the
 
operations
 
at
 
the
 
programme
 
level.
 
However,
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
communications
 
team
 
during
 
convenings
 
and
 
events
 
was
 
perceived
 
as
 
unsynchronous
 
with
 
the
 
donor’s
 
expectations.
 
Four
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
interviewed
 
echoed
 
a
 
similar
 
point
 
of
 
view.
 
 
Due
 
to
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
involvement
 
in
 
the
 
project
 
from
 
the
 
start,
 
the
 
communications
 
team
 
were
 
not
 
intimately
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
content.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
it
 
became
 
difﬁcult
 
because
 
their
 
content
 
felt
 
disconnected
 
and
 
caused
 
misalignment
 
during
 
the
 
event.
 
Sectoral
 
asset
 
creation
 
and
 
effective
 
advocacy
 
Diverse
 
opinions
 
were
 
presented
 
by
 
the
 
donors
 
on
 
how
 
they
 
perceived
 
The
 
Council’s
 
quality
 
of
 
outputs
 
and
 
the
 
strategy
 
towards
 
the
 
evidence
 
generation
 
and
 
outreach
 
process.
 
Factoring
 
diversity
 
of
 
methods
 
and
 
depth
 
of
 
research,
 
most
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
extremely
 
effective
 
in
 
communicating
 
its
 
high-quality
 
research.
 
The
 
quality
 
of
 
products,
 
dissemination
 
of
 
the
 
insights
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
outreach
 
strategy
 
has
 
been
 
effective,
 
and
 
a
 
ﬁne
 
balance
 
exists
 
as
 
they
 
publish
 
a
 
portfolio
 
of
 
research
 
content.
  
 
Overall,
 
on
 
the
 
advocacy
 
front,
 
donors
 
appreciated
 
the
 
active
 
engagement
 
in
 
decision-making
 
and
 
policy-making
 
processes
 
at
 
the
 
local
 
and
 
national
 
levels.

The
 
Council
 
has
 
effectively
 
published
 
its
 
reports
 
with
 
valuable
 
content
 
rather
 
than
 
focusing
 
on
 
pure
 
numbers.
 
If
 
you
 
introspect
 
on
 
the
 
content
 
they
 
generate,
 
it
 
is
 
beneﬁcial,
 
credible,
 
and
 
understandable
 
rather
 
than
 
information
 
noise.
 
For
 
instance,
 
look
 
at
 
their
 
website,
 
it
 
is
 
effective,
 
accessible,
 
and
 
a
 
well-organised
 
platform
 
disseminating
 
their
 
reports
 
and
 
available
 
to
 
even
 
the
 
public.
 
 
The

the

analytical
 
synthesis,
 
sense-making
 
of
 
the

interpretation,
 
narrative
 
building,
 
and
 
visualisations
 
are
 
perceived
 
to
 
be
 
remarkably
 
high
 
quality.
 
The
 
ﬁnal
 
report
 
or
 
the
 
convening
 
provides
 
a
 
crisp,
 
precise
 
closure
 
to
 
the
 
engagement
 
and
 
often
 
ends
 
as
 
a
 
sectoral
 
asset.
 
This
 
was
 
the
 
dominant
 
narrative
 
of
 
nearly
 
80%
 
of
 
the
 
donors.
 
 
However,
 
a
 
single
 
donor
 
shared
 
how
 
communication
 
with
 
The
 
Council
 
had
 
been
 
particularly
 
difﬁcult.
 
Getting
 
a
 
streamlined
 
product
 
out
 
with
 
multiple
 
iterations
 
and
 
multiple
 
insights
 
has
 
been
 
perceived
 
as
 
a
 
challenge.
 
Speciﬁcally,
 
getting
 
feedback
 
on
 
the
 
advocacy
 
pieces
 
and
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
aggregating
 
and
 
communicating
 
the
 
changes
 
before
 
arriving
 
at
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
output
 
was
 
a
 
haphazard
 
experience.
 
The
 
inputs
 
from
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
were
 
useful
 
but
 
came
 
very
 
delayed.
 
Lots
 
of
 
effort
 
and
 
mind
 
space
 
was
 
spent
 
on
 
the
 
process;
 
however,
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
output
 
was
 
satisfactory.
 
 
A
 
lot
 
of
 
back-and-forth
 
effort
 
was
 
required
 
to
 
get
 
feedback
 
from
 
The
 
Council
 
on
 
the
 
advocacy
 
products.
 
We
 
did
 
not
 
observe
 
any
 
structure
 
or
 
set
 
processes
 
during
 
this
 
exchange,
 
like
 
inserting
 
comments,
 
lack
 
of
 
constructive
 
critiques,
 
too
 
many
 
people
 
commenting
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
draft
 
etc.
 
 
Through
 
the
 
lens
 
of
 
potential,
 
the
 
donors
 
feel
 
The
 
Council
 
seems
 
ahead
 
of
 
the
 
curve
 
compared
 
to
 
other
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
India
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
competencies
 
and
 
capacities
 
to
 
create
 
knowledge
 
outputs,
 
policy
 
convenings.
 
However,
 
few
 
donors
 
felt
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
had
 
not
 
capitalised
 
on
 
this
 
potential
 
through
 
their
 
marketing,
 
communications,
 
and
 
PR
 
teams.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
avenue
 
where
 
The
 
Council
 
could
 
speciﬁcally
 
re-strategies,
 
improvise
 
and
 
learn
 
from
 
the
 
global
 
research
 
think
 
tanks,
 
especially
 
since
 
the
 
ambition
 
is
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
key
 
decision-makers
 
in
 
the
 
global
 
context
 
and
 
transition
 
to
 
working
 
towards
 
international
 
policy
 
making.

Transition
 
towards
 
institution

ecosystem-level
 
sustainability
 
The
 
organic
 
and
 
intuitive
 
development
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
is
 
highly
 
dependent
 
on
 
capitalising
 
on
 
the
 
institutional
 
development
 
modalities
 
to
 
transition
 
towards
 
sustainability
 
at
 
the
 
institution
 
and
 
ecosystem
 
levels.
 
 
Expert
 
opinions
 
and
 
donor
 
perceptions
 
suggest
 
that
 
institution
 
development
 
funds
 
and
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
ﬂexible
 
grants
 
have
 
aided
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
developing
 
diverse
 
endogenous
 
institutional
 
capacity
 
and
 
strategically
 
driven
 
organisational
 
development.
 
The
 
overarching
 
impact
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
and
 
the
 
legacy
 
The
 
Council
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
for
 
the
 
vision
 
2030
 
henceforth
 
could
 
be
 
summarised
 
through
 
the
 
following
 
institutional
 
levers,
 
i.e.,
 
 
1.
 
Institutional
 
capacity
 
development
 
and
 
strategic
 
thought
 
leadership
 
excellence.
 
2.
 
Strengthening

and

through
 
building
 
a
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leadership.
 
3.
 
Contributing
 
to
 
(and
 
especially

stronger
 
networks,
 
improved

and
 
commitments
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
the

reﬂection
 
and
 
action
 
on
 
the
 
‘service
 
functions’,
 
‘value

and

these
 
achievements.

The
 
importance
 
of
 
institutional
 
leadership
 
succession
 
For
 
an
 
intensive
 
and
 
integrated
 
focus
 
on
 
longer-term
 
institutional
 
strength,
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
focus
 
by
 
The
 
Council
 
on
 
governance
 
and
 
leadership
 
and
 
on
 
leadership
 
planning
 
is
 
critical.
 
Donors
 
perceived
 
that
 
generic
 
operational
 
and
 
functional
 
strengths
 
and
 
strategic
 
engagement
 
strategies
 
in
 
silos
 
possess
 
an
 
immense
 
risk.
 
Suppose
 
the
 
key
 
account

are
 
not

succeeded
 
by
 
a
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leadership
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
engagement
 
and
 
programmes
 
forward.
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
the
 
wealth
 
of
 
programmes,
 
initiatives
 
and
 
networks
 
created
 
will
 
become
 
ineffective
 
over
 
the
 
long
 
term.
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
a
 
talented
 
group
 
of
 
young
 
researchers,
 
the
 
dialogues
 
between
 
the
 
donors
 
and
 
The
 
Council
 
were
 
driven
 
by
 
their
 
leaders
 
and
 
primarily
 
focused
 
on
 
the
 
organisation's
 
leadership.
 
In
 
high
 
churn
 
areas,
 
like
 
pushing
 
deliverables
 
or
 
larger
 
convenings,
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
highly
 
effective
 
resources
 
and
 
stafﬁng
 
constraints
 
have
 
been
 
starkly
 
visible.
 
Stressing
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leadership
 
and
 
capacity,
 
some
 
donors
 
perceived
 
that
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
is
 
in
 
a
 
situation
 
where
 
he
 
has
 
to
 
do
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
heavy
 
lifting
 
on
 
account
 
of
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
resources
 
and
 
capacities.
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
focused
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
leader,
 
and
 
therefore,
 
the
 
survival
 
of
 
the
 
organisation
 
will
 
become
 
challenging.
 
Leadership
 
duties
 
should
 
be
 
shared
 
among
 
all
 
members.
 
A
 
couple
 
of
 
donors
 
highlighted
 
the
 
struggle
 
and
 
dependencies
 
across
 
other
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
sector,
 
such
 
as
 
TERI,
 
DA
 
etc.,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
leadership
 
and
 
succession
 
planning.
 
Despite
 
developing
 
an
 
idea
 
into
 
a
 
dynamic
 
and
 
ﬁnancially
 
sound
 
think
 
tank
 
on
 
the
 
global
 
stage,
 
the
 
institutions
 
suffered
 
massive
 
strategic
 
shifts
 
because
 
of
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
succession
 
planning.
 
It
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
great
 
model
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
get
 
ahead
 
of
 
the
 
curve.
 
I
 
remember
 
this
 
was
 
some
 
couple
 
of
 
years
 
ago.
 
A
 
perceived
 
successor
 
to
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
Ghosh
 
had
 
quit
 
the
 
organisation;
 
it
 
was
 
in
 
immediate
 
chaos.
 
In
 
certain
 
aspects,
 
they
 
were
 
never
 
able
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
left
 
by
 
the
 
person’s
 
exit.
 
Certain
 
members
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
should
 
be
 
considered
 
as
 
the
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leaders
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
networking
 
with
 
the
 
government
 
and
 
other
 
agencies,
 
and
 
these
 
functions
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
driven
 
only
 
by
 
Dr
 
Arunabha.
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
who
 
responded
 
strongly
 
expressed
 
concern
 
on
 
account
 
of
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
a
 
second
 
line
 
of
 
leadership.
 
They
 
viewed
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
major
 
barrier
 
to
 
achieving
 
institutional
 
sustainability
 
and
 
a
 
potential
 
risk
 
for
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
grow
 
and
 
expand.
 
While
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
The
 
Council’s
 
research,
 
they
 
ﬁnd
 
strong
 
institutional
 
leadership,
 
in
 
partnerships,
 
and
 
they
 
recognise
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
massive
 
improvement
 
in
 
leadership
 
building,
 
besides
 
Dr
 
Arunabha
 
and
 
a
 
few
 
key
 
leaders.
 
 
Fine-tuning
 
the
 
ecosystem
 
levers
 
Donors
 
highlighted
 
that
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
think
 
tanks
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
thought
 
leadership
 
support
 
to
 
the
 
funding
 
institutions
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
shaping
 
up
 
their
 
strategy
 
to
 
achieve
 
their
 
mission.
 
 
A
 
think
 
tank's
 
afﬁliation
 
is
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
intentional
 
or
 
strategic
 
gap
 
between
 
the
 
approaches
 
of
 
multiple
 
donors
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
and
 
guide
 
them
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
sectoral
 
needs
 
and
 
trends
 
to
 
achieve
 
the
 
larger
 
intended
 
vision
 
of
 
the
 
respective
 
philanthropy
 
or
 
foundation,
 
bringing
 
them
 
closer
 
together
 
in
 
the
 
sectoral
 
space.
 
57
 


 
Wherever
 
required,
 
the
 
expectation
 
from
 
the
 
engaging
 
think
 
tank
 
is
 
to
 
suggest,
 
course-correct
 
and
 
replicate
 
their
 
ﬂagship
 
programmes
 
and
 
assist
 
in
 
ideating
 
towards
 
emerging
 
sectoral
 
trends
 
and
 
gaps
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
to
 
maximise
 
and
 
accelerate
 
impact.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
aspect
 
in
 
which
 
The
 
Council
 
was
 
perceived
 
to
 
be
 
strategic
 
and
 
consistent
 
by
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
donors.
 
 
There
 
were
 
suggestions
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
widen
 
the
 
current
 
engagement
 
levers
 
beyond
 
evidence
 
generation,
 
policy
 
formulation,
 
advocacy,
 
dissemination,
 
and
 
outreach.
 
Four
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
donors
 
who
 
rank
 
high
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
criteria
 
deﬁned
 
earlier
 
perceived
 
that
 
The
 
Council
 
does
 
possess
 
the
 
potential
 
and
 
social
 
capital
 
to
 
take
 
forward
 
their

organisations.
 
They
 
believe
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
sectoral
 
need,
 
is
 
a
 
huge
 
gap
 
with
 
few

.
 
Think
 
Tanks
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
provide
 
thought
 
leadership
 
to
 
key
 
decision-makers,
 
translate
 
great
 
ideas
 
into
 
action,
 
ensure
 
uptake
 
of
 
ideas
 
by
 
decision-makers,
 
and

key
 
debate
 
amongst
 
civil
 
societies.

a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of

into
 
a

is
 
a
 
key
 
part
 
of
 
the

Key
 
perceptions
 
mapped
 
from
 
the
 
donors
 
(Cohort
 
2)
 
A
 
total
 
of
 
8
 
potential
 
investors
 
that
 
included
 
private
 
equity
 
investors/incubators
 
and
 
philanthropies/HNIs
 
were
 
interviewed
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
Cohort
 
2.
 
This
 
section
 
reports
 
their
 
perceptions
 
and
 
opinions.
 
10.1
 
Awareness
 
and
 
perception
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
Majority
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
in
 
Cohort
 
2
 
are
 
aware
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
the
 
think
 
tank’s
 
work.
 
The
 
donors
 
working
 
exclusively
 
in
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
or
 
niche
 
domains
 
were
 
unaware
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
 
Amongst
 
the
 
Cohort
 
2
 
interviewees
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
presence
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
change
 
domain,
 
the
 
awareness
 
of
 
The
 
Council,
 
their
 
sectoral
 
position,
 
and
 
the
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
services
 
offered
 
were
 
noticeable.
 
In
 
a
 
few
 
cases,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
misconception
 
regarding
 
the
 
various
 
value
 
propositions
 
the
 
institution
 
offered.
 
Despite
 
the
 
high
 
awareness,
 
only
 
2-3
 
donors
 
had
 
in-depth
 
knowledge
 
about
 
The
 
Council’s
 
impact
 
or
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
impact.
 
 
We
 
are
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
work
 
being
 
done
 
by
 
The
 
Council,
 
we
 
have
 
funded
 
think
 
tanks
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
and
 
we
 
will
 
come
 
to
 
them.
 
As
 
of
 
now,
 
we
 
are
 
still
 
exploring
 
this
 
space
 
and
 
eventually
 
will
 
get
 
to
 
them

Prior
 
work
 
with
 
think
 
tanks/research
 
The
 
impact
 
investing
 
ecosystem
 
has
 
investors
 
with
 
two
 
dominating
 
investment
 
behaviours,
 
i.e.,
 
●
 
Investors
  
who
 
prioritise
 
ﬁnancial
 
returns
 
over
 
impact
 
created
 
 
●
 
Those
 
who
 
look
 
for
 
a
 
high
 
social
 
impact
 
as
 
a
 
return
 
on
 
investments.
 
 
Cohort
 
2
 
included
 
both
 
donor
 
typologies
 
with
 
clear
 
patterns
 
coming
 
out
 
on
 
how
 
value
 
propositions
 
such
 
as
 
policy
 
research
 
or
 
evidence
 
generation
 
were
 
perceived.
 
 
The
 
donors
 
siding
 
towards
 
the
 
ﬁnancial
 
return
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
spectrum
 
had
 
marginal
 
interactions
 
with
 
think
 
tanks,
 
let
 
alone
 
funding
 
one.
 
Market-led
 
business
 
models
 
drove
 
their
 
investment
 
philosophy,
 
and
 
proﬁt-driven
 
products,
 
solutions
 
and
 
social
 
returns
 
were
 
perceived
 
as
 
an
 
add-on.
 
Organisations
 
from
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
space,
 
along
 
with
 
a
 
few
 
NBFCs
 
operating
 
in
 
the
 
domain
 
of
 
impact
 
investing
 
had
 
a
 
similar
 
orientation.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
fund
 
research
 
at
 
this
 
point;
 
however,
 
we
 
try
 
to
 
inﬂuence
 
people
 
who
 
can
 
fund
 
research
 
to
 
move
 
funding
 
into
 
areas
 
that
 
require
 
them.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
see
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
business
 
cases
 
for
 
a
 
research
 
think
 
tank
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
sustainable.
 
However,
 
we
 
see
 
opportunities
 
in
 
few
 
core
 
issues
 
in
 
climate,
 
such
 
as
 
predictive
 
modelling,
 
which
 
can
 
predict
 
extreme
 
climate
 
events
 
 
The
 
organisations
 
and
 
investors
 
that
 
focus
 
on
 
social
 
return
 
on
 
investments
 
perceived
 
clear
 
beneﬁts
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
think
 
tanks
 
and
 
other
 
research
 
organisations.
 
Policy-led
 
transformation
 
and
 
evidence-based
 
solutions
 
were
 
clearly
 
on
 
their
 
radar
 
for
 
investments,
 
and
 
they
 
also
 
had
 
a
 
demonstrable
 
history
 
of
 
collaborating
 
with
 
research
 
institutions.
 
A
 
few
 
investors
 
also
 
walked
 
through
 
robust
 
frameworks
 
they
 
used
 
to
 
evaluate
 
think
 
tanks
 
and
 
other
 
research
 
organisations
 
before
 
partnering
 
and
 
during
 
investments.

To
 
summarise,
 
the
 
perception
 
of
 
research
 
and
 
think
 
tanks
 
as
 
an
 
avenue
 
for
 
investment
 
varies
 
signiﬁcantly
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
trend
 
in
 
the
 
sector,
 
the
 
portfolio
 
of
 
the
 
donor,
 
and
 
the
 
attitude
 
of
 
the
 
donor
 
in
 
eliciting
 
a
 
clear
 
return
 
(ﬁnancial
 
or
 
social)
 
on
 
the
 
investment,
 
despite
 
operating
 
in
 
the
 
impact
 
investing
 
ecosystem.
 
10.3
 
 
Partnerships
 
and
 
collaboration
 
 
Partnerships
 
and
 
collaboration
 
were
 
areas
 
of
 
signiﬁcant
 
discussions
 
with
 
Cohort
 
2
 
donors.
 
The
 
only
 
exception
 
was
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
investors,
 
whose
 
focus
 
was
 
centred
 
around
 
individual
 
business
 
models
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
and
 
the
 
sustenance
 
of
 
the
 
investment.
 
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
in
 
Cohort
 
2
 
preferred
 
an
 
investment
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
synergistic
 
with
 
their
 
existing
 
portfolio,
 
which
 
indicates,
 
 
●
 
Expectations
 
of
 
a
 
high
 
degree
 
of
 
collaboration
 
 
●
 
Engaging
 
in
 
multiple
 
investments
 
under
 
the
 
portfolio.
 
 
A
 
few
 
donors
 
had
 
clear
 
criteria
 
deﬁned
 
for
 
investing,
 
which
 
emerged
 
from
 
the
 
experiences
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
portfolio
 
as
 
speciﬁc
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impact
 
indicators
 
of
 
success.
 
The
 
ability
 
of
 
the
 
potential
 
investee
 
to
 
collaborate
 
was
 
dependent
 
on
 
their
 
composite
 
scoring
 
across
 
the
 
indicators.
 
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
any
 
organisation
 
we
 
invest
 
in
 
to
 
ﬁt
 
into
 
our
 
larger
 
strategic
 
goals;
 
it
 
should
 
work
 
well
 
within
 
our
 
existing
 
portfolio.
 
The
 
donors
 
also
 
clearly
 
shared
 
opinions
 
that,
 
to
 
move
 
the
 
needle
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
signiﬁcantly,
 
multiple
 
sets
 
of
 
competencies
 
and
 
expertise
 
are
 
required,
 
which
 
would
 
be
 
impossible
 
for
 
a
 
single
 
organisation
 
or
 
partner
 
to
 
exhibit.
 
 
10.4
 
 
Motivations
 
for
 
investing
 
in
 
the
 
social
 
impact
 
space
 
 
While
 
the
 
social
 
impact
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
common
 
themes
 
amongst
 
all
 
Cohort
 
2
 
participants,
 
their
 
deﬁnition
 
of
 
Impact
 
varied
 
quite
 
a
 
bit.
 
 
Few
 
donors
 
were
 
extremely
 
ambitious
 
and
 
would
 
only
 
consider
 
transformations
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
as
 
impact
 
(changes
 
in
 
policy,
 
adoption
 
of
 
stakeholders
 
at
 
scale,
 
policy
 
implementation
 
at
 
scale
 
etc.),
 
unlike
 
the
 
conventional
 
perception
 
of
 
measuring
 
impact
 
throughout
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
of
 
change.
 
Typically,
 
the
 
new-age
 
philanthropic
 
donors
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
want
 
to
 
be
 
bound
 
by
 
conventional
 
views
 
on
 
how
 
philanthropy
 
operates.
 
 
We
 
are
 
not
 
looking
 
at
 
numbers
 
alone;
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
dent
 
in
 
this
 
space.
 
Change
 
perspectives
 
around
 
climate;
 
we
 
are
 
audacious
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
how
 
unique
 
we
 
are;
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
tackle
 
issues
 
which
 
others
 
are
 
not
 
seeing.
 
We
 
are
 
not
 
risk
 
averse;
 
we
 
are
 
not
 
looking
 
at
 
past
 
experiences.
 
Interestingly,
 
all
 
the
 
new-age
 
philanthropic
 
donors
 
in
 
Cohort
 
2
 
indicated
 
their
 
pathway
 
to
 
impact
 
is
 
unique.
 
This
 
is
 
directly
 
in
 
contrast
 
to
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
donors
 
in
 
the
 
Cohort,
 
who
 
perceived
 
impact
 
through
 
the
 
lens
 
of
 
sustainable
 
business
 
models.
 
These
 
donors
 
believed
 
that
 
while
 
investing
 
in
 
non-proﬁts
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
unlocking
 
impact,
 
there
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
sustainable
 
business
 
model
 
that
 
goes
 
hand
 
in
 
hand
 
with
 
the
 
same.

10.5
 
 
Interpretations
 
from
 
the
 
discussions
 
While
 
the
 
Cohort
 
2
 
shortlisting,
 
the
 
donors'
 
proﬁles
 
drawn
 
were
 
private
 
equity
 
investors/incubators
 
or
 
philanthropies/HNIs,
 
post-synthesis
 
three
 
typologies
 
of
 
funding
 
institutions
 
and
 
mechanisms
 
emerged.
 
Their
 
deﬁning
 
characteristics
 
are
 
detailed
 
in
 
this
 
section.
 
New
 
age
 
philanthropies
  
 
Proﬁle
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
This
 
group
 
consists
 
of
 
investing
 
organisations
 
driven
 
by
 
high-net-worth
 
individuals.
 
This
 
includes
 
organisations
 
such
 
as
 
Rohini
 
Nilekani
 
philanthropies,
 
Rainmatter
 
Foundation,
 
Pratiksha
 
Trust
 
etc.
  
Most
 
of
 
these
 
organisations
 
are
 
still
 
in
 
their
 
early
 
stages
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
quite
 
experimental
 
in
 
their
 
approach
 
to
 
investing.
  
 
Portfolio
 
and
 
Focus
 
areas
 
The
 
portfolio
 
of
 
these
 
investors
 
is
 
quite
 
varied.
 
The
 
focus
 
areas
 
also
 
vary
 
signiﬁcantly,
 
mostly
 
driven
 
by
 
individual
 
interests
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
illustrated
 
with
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
Pratiksha
 
Trust
 
investing
 
in
 
Brain,
 
Computation,
 
and
 
Data
 
which
 
stems
 
a
 
lot
 
from
 
the
 
personal
 
interests
 
of
 
their
 
largest
 
backer
 
Kris
 
Gopalakrishnan.
 
However,
 
a
 
key
 
point
 
to
 
note
 
is
 
that
 
innovation
 
and
 
technology
 
are
 
common
 
themes
 
that
 
most
 
of
 
these
 
investors
 
focus
 
on.
 
The
 
nexus
 
of
 
domains
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
key
 
feature
 
of
 
these
 
investments.
 
During
 
the
 
interviews,
 
most
 
investors
 
in
 
this
 
category
 
stressed
 
that
 
organisations
 
working
 
on
 
issues
 
that
 
cut
 
across
 
domains
 
are
 
preferred.
 
 
Type
 
of
 
investments
 
While
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
limitations
 
to
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
investments
 
the
 
new
 
age
 
philanthropies
 
can
 
make
 
from
 
a
 
legal
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
grant-based
 
models
 
dominate.
 
Grants
 
give
 
them
 
ﬂexibility,
 
as
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
Rainmatter
 
capital
 
which
 
has
 
a
 
dedicated
 
fund
 
for
 
organisational
 
grants,
 
which
 
allows
 
grantees
 
to
 
experiment
 
a
 
lot
 
more
 
than
 
output/outcome-based
 
grants
 
which
 
typically
 
dominate
 
this
 
space,
 
at
 
least
 
from
 
an
 
Indian
 
context.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
investments
 
made
 
are
 
multi-year,
 
unrestricted
 
and
 
not
 
tied
 
to
 
speciﬁc
 
outcomes.
 
These
 
organisations
 
also
 
usually
 
have
 
dedicated
 
units
 
which
 
focus
 
exclusively
 
on
 
equity
 
investments
 
where
 
along
 
with
 
impact,
 
proﬁtability
 
becomes
 
a
 
key
 
investment
 
criterion.
 
 
Approach
 
to
 
investments
 
The
 
approach
 
to
 
investments
 
by
 
new
 
age
 
philanthropists
 
are
 
extremely
 
individualised.
 
While
 
broad
 
sets
 
of
 
guidelines
 
are
 
deﬁned,
 
there
 
is
 
ample
 
ﬂexibility
 
available.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
emphasis
 
on
 
leadership
 
and
 
people,
 
which
 
was
 
evident
 
from
 
the
 
conversations
 
with
 
these
 
investors.
 
A
 
clear
 
focus
 
on
 
leadership
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
process
 
was
 
observed.
 
A
 
trust-based
 
approach
 
to
 
investment
 
is
 
observed
 
where
 
the
 
investment
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
organisation’s
 
vision
 
rather
 
than
 
speciﬁc
 
outcomes.
 
 
Expectations
 
from
 
the
 
investments
 
Since
 
the
 
new
 
age
 
investments
 
are
 
long-term
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
focus
 
on
 
speciﬁc
 
outcomes,
 
the
 
key
 
expectations
 
from
 
the
 
investment
 
are
 
at
 
the
 
sectoral
 
level
 
regarding
 
innovation
 
or
 
an
 
idea
 
that
 
61
 


 
moves
 
the
 
needle
 
forward
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
and
 
transforms
 
the
 
sector.
 
Scale
 
is
 
also
 
key
 
for
 
these
 
investments,
 
particularly
 
the
 
technology-based
 
investments
 
where
 
the
 
expectation
 
is
 
to
 
leverage
 
technology
 
to
 
achieve
 
impact
 
at
 
scale.
 
There
 
are
 
also
 
limited
 
reporting
 
requirements,
 
with
 
most
 
investors
 
expecting
 
an
 
update
 
once
 
a
 
quarter.
 
Impact
 
Investors
 
 
Proﬁle
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
The
 
impact
 
investor
 
group,
 
such
 
as
 
Omidyar
 
Network
 
and
 
Social
 
Alpha,
 
invests
 
in
 
organisations
 
that
 
operate
 
in
 
both
 
the
 
start-up
 
and
 
the
 
non-proﬁt
 
space.
 
Most
 
of
 
these
 
organisations
 
have
 
been
 
around
 
for
 
over
 
a
 
decade
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
more
 
standard
 
approach
 
to
 
investing.
 
 
Portfolio
 
and
 
Focus
 
areas
 
The
 
portfolio
 
of
 
the
 
impact
 
investors
 
is
 
predominantly
 
early-stage
 
companies
 
and,
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
few
 
non-proﬁts.
 
The
 
focus
 
areas
 
are
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
larger
 
strategy
 
and
 
are
 
decided
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
larger
 
philosophy
 
of
 
the
 
investor.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
in
 
this
 
group
 
were
 
not
 
investing
 
in
 
organisations
 
working
 
on
 
climate
 
change
 
as
 
they
 
felt
 
sustainable
 
business
 
models
 
are
 
yet
 
to
 
emerge
 
in
 
this
 
space.
  
While
 
they
 
carry
 
non-proﬁt
 
organisations
 
in
 
their
 
portfolios,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
‘ﬁt’
 
to
 
the
 
portfolio
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
alignment
 
to
 
the
 
larger
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
portfolio.
 
 
Type
 
of
 
investments
 
Majority
 
of
 
the
 
investments
 
are
 
equity-based
 
to
 
for-proﬁt
 
companies.
 
However,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
sizable
 
portion
 
of
 
non-proﬁt
 
organisations
 
in
 
the
 
portfolio
 
where
 
the
 
investment
 
is
 
a
 
grant.
 
For
 
equity
 
investment,
 
the
 
horizon
 
is
 
between
 
5
 
to
 
7
 
years
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
case
 
for
 
most
 
investments
 
in
 
early-stage
 
companies.
 
For
 
non-proﬁts,
 
the
 
period
 
of
 
investments
 
varies
 
based
 
on
 
whether
 
the
 
investment
 
is
 
made
 
on
 
a
 
project
 
basis
 
or
 
for
 
a
 
programme.
  
 
Approach
 
to
 
investments
 
The
 
way
 
these
 
investors
 
approach
 
their
 
investments
 
is
 
extremely
 
organised,
 
with
 
well-deﬁned
 
frameworks
 
that
 
guide
 
the
 
investment
 
strategies.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
demarcation
 
between
 
direct
 
impact
 
vis-a-vis
 
sectoral
 
impact,
 
with
 
strategies
 
for
 
both
 
outlined
 
clearly.
 
The
 
areas
 
of
 
investments
 
are
 
distilled
 
from
 
the
 
larger
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
organisation
 
and
 
hence
 
have
 
limited
 
scope
 
to
 
be
 
ﬂexible.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
organisations
 
in
 
this
 
group
 
have
 
a
 
1–3-year
 
strategy
 
for
 
their
 
investments
 
locked
 
in,
 
and
 
in
 
that
 
period,
 
the
 
focus
 
remains
 
only
 
on
 
the
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
strategy.
 
The
 
companies/organisations
 
are
 
evaluated
 
on
 
speciﬁc
 
metrics,
 
which
 
revolve
 
around
 
the
 
ﬁt
 
to
 
the
 
portfolio,
 
leadership,
 
risks,
 
ﬁnancial
 
metrics
 
(in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
for-proﬁts),
 
reach
 
and
 
policy
 
impact
 
(in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
non-proﬁts).
 
 
Expectations
 
from
 
the
 
investments
 
The
 
investments
 
are
 
focussed
 
on
 
speciﬁc
 
outcomes.
 
The
 
key
 
expectations
 
from
 
the
 
investment
 
are
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
right
 
at
 
the
 
start.
 
For
 
non-proﬁts,
 
expectations
 
are
 
further
 
customised
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
impact
 
they
 
are
 
envisioned
 
to
 
create
 
such
 
as
 
direct
 
and
 
sectoral
 
impacts.
 
To
 
illustrate
 
using
 
an
 
example,
 
Omidyar
 
Network
 
has
 
ﬁve
 
distinct
 
levels
 
of
 
outcome
 
deﬁned
 
62
 


 
speciﬁcally
 
for
 
organisations
 
working
 
on
 
research
 
and
 
policy.
 
At
 
the
 
highest
 
levels,
 
these
 
would
 
involve
 
achieving
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
basic
 
assumptions
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
via
 
a
 
transformational
 
policy
 
that
 
cuts
 
across
 
sectors
 
and
 
geographies.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
classiﬁcation
 
of
 
non-proﬁts
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
impact
 
achieved
 
and
 
through
 
our
 
interactions
 
with
 
multiple
 
investors
 
in
 
this
 
space,
 
The
 
Council
 
would
 
rank
 
at
 
the
 
highest
 
levels
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
impact.
 
 
Private
 
Equity
 
and
 
Debt
 
Proﬁle
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
The
 
private
 
equity
 
and
 
debt
 
group
 
comprises
 
investing
 
organisations
 
that
 
typically
 
operate
 
in
 
the
 
start-up
 
space,
 
such
 
as
 
Aavishkaar
 
capital,
 
Yunus
 
Social
 
Business
 
(YSB),
 
Caspian
 
Impact
 
etc.
 
While
 
these
 
investors
 
categorise
 
themselves
 
as
 
impact
 
investors,
 
they
 
focus
 
on
 
ﬁnancial
 
returns.
 
Some
 
of
 
these
 
investors
 
are
 
in
 
the
 
venture
 
debt
 
space
 
as
 
well,
 
where
 
the
 
ownership
 
of
 
the
 
investees
 
is
 
not
 
diluted
 
to
 
raise
 
capital.
 
 
Portfolio
 
and
 
Focus
 
areas
 
The
 
portfolios
 
in
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
and
 
debt
 
space
 
are
 
diverse,
 
but
 
within
 
the
 
organisation,
 
it
 
is
 
quite
 
focused.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
portfolio
 
is
 
dominated
 
by
 
for-proﬁt
 
companies.
 
There
 
are
 
few
 
instances
 
of
 
funding
 
to
 
non-proﬁts,
 
such
 
as
 
YSB
 
which
 
is
 
open
 
to
 
funding
 
non-proﬁt
 
organisations
 
provided
 
a
 
sustainable
 
revenue
 
stream
 
is
 
available.
 
An
 
example
 
of
 
this
 
would
 
be
 
non-proﬁts
 
engaging
 
in
 
training/capacity
 
building
 
of
 
youth
 
for
 
a
 
fee;
 
YSB
 
is
 
open
 
to
 
funding
 
the
 
capital
 
expenditure
 
of
 
such
 
organisations
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
can
 
set
 
up
 
operations.
 
Climate
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
focus
 
area
 
for
 
these
 
investors.
 
However,
 
investors
 
in
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
and
 
debt
 
space
 
do
 
not
 
support
 
multi-sectoral
 
funding.
 
 
Type
 
of
 
investments
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
private
 
equity
 
and
 
debt
 
investments
 
are
 
equity-based,
 
with
 
few
 
companies
 
offering
 
debt
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
quasi-equity.
 
Equity
 
investments
 
are
 
usually
 
for
 
a
 
horizon
 
of
 
10-12
 
years,
 
considering
 
the
 
organisations
 
are
 
looking
 
at
 
the
 
social
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
returns.
 
With
 
debt,
 
the
 
horizon
 
is
 
usually
 
under
 
three
 
years.
 
The
 
investments
 
are
 
earmarked
 
for
 
speciﬁc
 
projects/activities
 
with
 
regular
 
reporting
 
requirements.
 
 
Approach
 
to
 
investments
 
As
 
mentioned
 
above,
 
the
 
sustainability
 
of
 
cash
 
ﬂows
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
metric
 
to
 
evaluate
 
organisations
 
for
 
investors
 
in
 
this
 
space.
 
Even
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
non-proﬁt
 
organisations
 
that
 
have
 
revenue
 
streams,
 
managing
 
cash
 
ﬂows
 
is
 
expected.
 
For-proﬁt
 
organisations
 
are
 
evaluated
 
similarly
 
to
 
those
 
operating
 
in
 
the
 
non-impact
 
space,
 
with
 
robust
 
cash-to-cash
 
cycles
 
and
 
lower
 
leverage
 
than
 
industry
 
standards
 
and
 
other
 
ﬁnancial
 
metrics.
 
 
Expectations
 
from
 
the
 
investments
 
The
 
investments
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
generate
 
returns
 
from
 
a
 
ﬁnancial
 
point
 
of
 
view;
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
cases,
 
these
 
returns
 
are
 
slightly
 
lower
 
than
 
the
 
industry
 
average,
 
but
 
a
 
decent
 
ﬁnancial
 
return
 
is
 
non-negotiable.
 
Social
 
returns
 
are
 
not
 
necessarily
 
measured
 
robustly
 
post
 
the
 
investment,
 
but
 
the
 
potential
 
impact
 
the
 
organisation
 
can
 
create
 
is
 
evaluated
 
and
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
decision
 
point
 
to
 
63
 


 
invest.
 
A
 
few
 
investors
 
we
 
spoke
 
to
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
indicated
 
that
 
while
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
mandate
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
ﬁrms
 
that
 
create
 
a
 
positive
 
social
 
or
 
environmental
 
impact,
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
necessarily
 
mission-driven
 
organisations
 
and
 
have
 
clear
 
ﬁnancial
 
goals.
 
 
A
 
donor’s
 
voice
 
Context
 
 
A
 
social
 
change
 
venture
 
investor
 
working
 
towards
 
creating
 
structural
 
changes
 
that
 
will
 
fundamentally
 
shift
 
the
 
systems
 
that
 
govern
 
our
 
daily
 
lives,
 
having
 
versatile
 
experience
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
of
 
business
 
and
 
technology.
 
By
 
their
 
hybrid
 
governance
 
structure
 
and
 
strategic
 
intent,
 
the
 
social
 
change
 
venture
 
investor
 
is
 
open
 
to
 
funding
 
both
 
for-proﬁt
 
and
 
non-proﬁt
 
organisations.
 
Their
 
guiding
 
principle
 
is
 
that
 
social
 
change
 
could
 
be
 
accelerated
 
through
 
impact-driven
 
change
 
makers
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
sector.
 
Strategically
 
the
 
investor
 
ﬁrm
 
takes
 
decisions
 
on
 
a
 
5-year
 
timeline,
 
and
 
they
 
fund
 
an
 
array
 
of
 
sectors
 
such
 
as
 
education,
 
digital
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
inclusion,
 
technological
 
interventions
 
etc.
 
While
 
Climate
 
Action
 
is
 
not
 
at
 
the
 
forefront
 
of
 
the
 
previous
 
ﬁve-year
 
strategy,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
high
 
likelihood
 
of
 
climate
 
being
 
a
 
focus
 
in
 
the
 
strategy
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
5
 
years.
 
  
 
Investor
 
perspective
 
The
 
investor
 
prioritises
 
impact
 
and
 
returns
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
continuum
 
and
 
not
 
as
 
opposing
 
forces.
 
The
 
investor
 
has
 
built
 
a
 
robust
 
rubric
 
and
 
a
 
structured
 
approach
 
to
 
their
 
investments
 
and
 
measures
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
investment
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
created
 
by
 
the
 
investment.
 
Each
 
step
 
of
 
the
 
process
 
is
 
very
 
well
 
articulated
 
and
 
documented
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
frameworks,
 
results
 
metrics,
 
and
 
guiding
 
tools.
 
Speciﬁcally,
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
measuring
 
the
 
impact,
 
a
 
robust
 
framework
 
is
 
adopted,
 
which
 
goes
 
into
 
great
 
depth
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
whether
 
the
 
impact
 
is
 
directly
 
reaching
 
the
 
communities,
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
factoring
 
for
 
attribution
 
and
 
contribution,
 
whether
 
the
 
impact
 
is
 
sector-speciﬁc
 
etc.
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
impact
 
type,
 
the
 
investment
 
approach
 
is
 
further
 
customised.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
precise
 
classiﬁcation
 
of
 
investees
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
impact,
 
correlation
 
with
 
the
 
capital
 
deployed
 
and
 
an
 
accountability
 
framework.
 
 
 
From
 
The
 
Councils
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
policy
 
impact
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
area
 
of
 
focus
 
for
 
the
 
investor.
 
As
 
mentioned
 
earlier,
 
this
 
is
 
further
 
broken
 
down
 
into
 
a
 
detailed
 
framework
 
on
 
how
 
policy
 
impact
 
is
 
envisioned.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
from
 
a
 
focus
 
audience's
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
impact
 
or
 
the
 
medium.
 
For
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
key
 
partner
 
for
 
the
 
investor,
 
there
 
must
 
be
 
alignment
 
at
 
multiple
 
levels
 
as
 
follows

that
 
has
 
been
 
done
 
by
 
The

When
 
asked
 
to
 
locate
 
The
 
Council
 
on
 
their
 
framework
 
of
 
impact,
 
the
 
response
 
was
 
as
 
follows.
 
 
64
 


 
The
 
Council
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
impact
 
star
 
(highest
 
categorisation
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
impact)
 
in
 
our
 
framework;
 
they
 
are
 
very
 
high
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
sectoral
 
impact
 
created;
 
this
 
would
 
involve
 
achieving
 
a
 
paradigm
 
shift
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
via
 
a
 
transformational
 
policy

with
 
the

goals
 
of
 
The

in
 
the
 
next
 
decade,
 
which
 
is
 
to
 
 
●
 
Become
 
a
 
world-class
 
institution
 
in
 
data,
 
outreach,
 
and
 
analysis
 
of
 
global
 
signiﬁcance
 
with
 
a

●
 
Move
 
sustainability
 
from
 
the
 
“Margin”
 
to
 
“Mainstream”
 
by
 
working
 
across
 
the
 
themes
 
of
 
policy,
 
technology,
 
ﬁnance,
 
and
 
behaviour
 
to
 
move
 
from
 
a
 
policy
 
advisory
 
to
 
a
 
mainstream
 
economy.
 
 
●
 
Invest
 
in
 
the
 
institutional
 
development
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
and
 
build
 
institutional
 
capacities
 
of
 
the
 
organisation.
 
 
All
 
these
 
criteria
 
are
 
met
 
by
 
this
 
group
 
of
 
investors,
 
who
 
are
 
focused
 
on
 
investing
 
in
 
institutions
 
such
 
as
 
The
 
Council,
 
which
 
works
 
at
 
the
 
nexus
 
of
 
domains
 
and
 
has
 
great
 
leadership,
 
which
 
The
 
Council
 
boasts
 
of
 
as
 
well.
 
These
 
investors
 
are
 
based
 
out
 
of
 
India,
 
which
 
reduces
 
the
 
risks
 
associated
 
with
 
potential
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
FCRA
 
laws.
 
 
The
 
Impact
 
investors
 
category
 
ﬁts
 
well
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
vision
 
of
 
the
 
investors
 
and
 
types
 
of
 
investments
 
made,
 
however,
 
the
 
challenge
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
investment
 
approach
 
of
 
these
 
investors,
 
and
 
the
 
expectations
 
they
 
hold.
 
Since
 
these
 
investors
 
follow
 
an
 
extremely
 
structured
 
approach
 
to
 
investing,
 
The
 
Council
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
improve
 
its
 
engagement
 
mechanisms
 
on
 
building
 
partnerships
 
and
 
engagement.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
expectations
 
as
 
well,
 
this
 
category
 
of
 
investors
 
looks
 
for
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
outcomes
 
and
 
robust
 
ways
 
to
 
establish
 
contribution.
 
The
 
limitation
 
of
 
engaging
 
with
 
this
 
set
 
of
 
investors
 
is
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
ﬂexibility.
 
Lastly,
 
Private
 
Equity
 
and
 
Debt
 
occupy
 
an
 
important
 
space
 
in
 
the
 
climate
 
change
 
domain
 
with
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
investments,
 
particularly
 
in
 
the
 
space
 
of
 
sustainable
 
mobility
 
and
 
agriculture-climate
 
nexus.
 
However,
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
ﬁt
 
into
 
the
 
larger
 
vision
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
decade
 
as
 
such
 
funding
 
sources
 
would
 
require
 
The
 
Council
 
to
 
pivot
 
to
 
a
 
for-proﬁt
 
enterprise
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
particular
 
areas
 
of
 
climate
 
change,
 
going
 
against
 
the
 
more
 
important
 
Council
 
goal
 
to
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
nexus
 
of
 
sectors.

However,
 
the
 
strategic
 
alignment
 
of
 
CSR
 
investments
 
is
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
following
 
three
 
key
 
aspects.
 
●
 
CSR
 
funds
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
complying
 
to

rules
 
and

and

●
 
Designing
 
and

programs
 
meeting
 
their
 
proportioned
 
annual
 
budget
 
and
 
highlighting
 
visible
 
outcomes
 
in
 
short
 
gestation
 
●
 
Post
 
pandemic,
 
the
 
CSR
 
managers
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
vulnerable
 
populations
 
on
 
livelihoods,
 
healthcare,
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
social
 
protection
 
ﬁnancial
 
services
 
Between
 
2015
 
to
 
2020,
 
the
 
spending
 
from
 
CSR
 
activities
 
is
 
estimated
 
to
 
be
 
INR
 
79,293
 
Crores
 
and
 
the
 
environmental
 
sustainability
 
spending
 
is
 
around
 
8%
 
for
 
environmental
 
sustainability.
  
The
 
average
 
spending
 
on
 
CSR
 
activities
 
per
 
organisation
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
5
 
years
 
ranges
 
from
 
INR
 
65
 
L
 
to
 
INR
 
75
 
L
 
per
 
year.
 
With
 
the
 
new
 
CSR
 
rules,
 
multi-year
 
CSR
 
investments
 
are
 
allowed,
 
and
 
ﬁrms
 
are
 
allowed
 
to
 
set
 
off
 
surplus
 
spending
 
for
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
years.
 
 
Philanthropy
 
in
 
India
 
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
clear
 
movement
 
towards
 
a
 
more
 
structured
 
approach
 
with
 
the
 
involvement
 
of
 
a
 
lot
 
more
 
stakeholders.
 
Given
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
Indian
 
growth
 
story,
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
philanthropy
 
has
 
changed

There

clear
 
movement
 
toward
 
a
 
more
 
structured
 
approach
 
with
 
the

There

a

an

for

groups
 
In
 
this
 
section
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
key
 
decision-making
 
elements
 
that
 
philanthropists,
 
HNIs,
 
and
 
Diaspora-led
 
funders
 
look
 
at
 
across
 
various
 
components
 
and
 
the
 
larger
 
proﬁle
 
of
 
donors
 
and
 
grant-making
 
organisations
 
that
 
suits
 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
The
 
Council.
 
 
Motivation
 
for
 
the
 
donor
 
Below
 
are
 
the
 
key
 
decision-making
 
elements
 
for
 
a
 
donor
 
organisation
 
looking
 
from
 
a
 
lens
 
of
 
the
 
primary
 
motivations
 
for
 
the
 
decision
 
to
 
fund.

These
 
choices
 
are
 
not
 
exhaustive,
 
there
 
are
 
several
 
other
 
points
 
on
 
which
 
decisions
 
might
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
made,
 
and
 
many
 
more
 
choices
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
donor.
 
The
 
extreme
 
choices
 
discussed
 
and
 
choices
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
continuum
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
extremes
 
are
 
not
 
the
 
only
 
ones
 
available.
 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
requirements
 
highlighted
 
by
 
The
 
Council,
 
philanthropists,
 
philanthropic
 
houses,
 
HNIs,
 
diaspora-led
 
funders
 
etc.
 
falling
 
under
 
the
 
junction
 
of
 
the
 
below
 
decision
 
choices
 
would
 
ﬁt
 
best.
 
These
 
donors
 
proﬁled
 
since
 
funding
 
out
 
of
 
choice
 
have
 
more
 
ﬂexibility
 
in
 
their
 
approach,
 
with
 
the
 
recent
 
trend
 
of
 
funders
 
taking
 
more
 
ownership
 
of
 
their
 
interventions
 
The
 
Council
 
is
 
well
 
positioned
 
to
 
leverage
 
funding
 
for
 
research
 
and
 
design
 
and
 
not
 
just
 
implementation
 
as
 
is
 
the
 
case
 
with
 
funders
 
who
 
support
 
causes.
 
Sustainability
 
is
 
an
 
overarching
 
theme
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
work
 
The
 
Council
 
undertakes,
 
at
 
times
 
this
 
requires
 
working
 
on
 
complex
 
nexus
 
of
 
sustainability
 
issues,
 
interdisciplinary
 
and
 
multidisciplinary
 
hypotheses
 
etc.
 
which
 
might
 
put
 
the
 
research
 
and
 
funding
 
needs
 
at
 
crosshairs
 
with
 
national
 
priorities
 
aimed
 
at
 
economic
 
development
 
and
 
with
 
the
 
key
 
stakeholders,
 
governments,
 
and
 
quasi-governments
 
in
 
the
 
ecosystem,
 
hence
 
a
 
funder
 
who
 
is
 
willing
 
to
 
fund
 
these
 
tough
 
grounds
 
is
 
extremely
 
crucial.
 
 
 
The
 
ﬁgure
 
represented
 
below,
 
depicts
 
the
 
key
 
decision
 
points
 
that
 
donors
 
must
 
take
 
on
 
the
 
various
 
methods
 
on
 
how
 
intent
 
gets
 
translated
 
into
 
a
 
strategy
 
and
 
approach
 
to
 
work.
 
 
To
 
achieve
 
the
 
larger
 
goals
 
of
 
The
 
Council
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
methods
 
of
 
delivering
 
philanthropic
 
intent
 
below
 
is
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
methods
 
that
 
are
 
required.
 
Transformative
 
funding
 
is
 
key
 
for
 
realising
 
the
 
vision
 
The
 
Council
 
has
 
for
 
2030,
 
funding
 
causes
 
and
 
work
 
that
 
creates
 
long-term
 
conditions
 
such
 
that
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
people
 
needing
 
curative
 
help
 
decreases.
 
‘The
 
Councils’
 
key
 
strength
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
key
 
discussions
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
young,
 
dynamic,
 
and
 
diverse
 
team.
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
for
 
the
 
potential
 
donors
 
to
 
be
 
comfortable
 
working
 
in
 
this
 
environment
 
that
 
would
 
foster
 
innovative
 
ideas,
 
perspectives,
 
and
 
criticisms.
 
Lastly,
 
it
 
is
 
paramount
 
that
 
the
 
funder
 
is
 
patient
 
with
 
the
 
capital
 
employed
 
and
 
looks
 
at
 
building
 
expertise
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
term.

Rohini

Foundation
 
Philanthropy
 
perspective:
 
The
 
philanthropy
 
is
 
keen
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
collaborations
 
among
 
institutions,
 
ideas
 
and
 
individuals
 
delivering
 
path-breaking
 
work
 
that
 
promotes
 
a
 
strong
 
samaj
 
with
 
ethical
 
leadership,
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
urgency
 
and
 
courage
 
to
 
learn.
 
Accordingly,
 
philanthropy
 
believes
 
in
 
and
 
works
 
for
 
the
 
revival
 
of
 
communities
 
and
 
builds
 
capacity
 
to
 
meet
 
their
 
functions
 
and
 
duties
 
towards
 
their
 
progress.
 
They
 
invest
 
in
 
institutions
 
that
 
co-create
 
and
 
enable
 
governance
 
among
 
the
 
community
 
institutions.
