1.
 
Context
 
India
 
accounts
 
for
 
nearly
 
25%
 
of
 
the
 
world’s
 
cotton
 
production.
 
Cotton
 
is
 
indeed
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
commercial
 
crops
 
cultivated
 
in
 
India.
 
It
 
plays
 
a
 
major
 
role
 
in
 
sustaining
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
an
 
estimated
 
6
 
million
 
cotton
 
farmers
 
and
 
40-50
 
million
 
people
 
engaged
 
in
 
allied
 
activities
 
such
 
as
 
cotton
 
processing
 
and
 
trade
1
.
 
Apart
 
from
 
being
 
the
 
key
 
commodity
 
in
 
fulﬁlling
 
the
 
clothing
 
requirements
 
of
 
the
 
Indian
 
populace,
 
cotton
 
is
 
also
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
largest
 
contributors
 
to
 
the
 
country’s
 
net
 
foreign
 
exchange.
 
For
 
this
 
very
 
reason,
 
it
 
is
 
rightly
 
termed
 
as
 
the
 
‘White
 
Gold’
 
of
 
the
 
country.
 
 
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
spearheads
 
the
 
world’s
 
sustainability
 
initiatives
 
for
 
cotton.
 
Their
 
mission
 
is
 
to
 
‘help
 
cotton
 
communities
 
survive
 
and
 
thrive,
 
while
 
protecting
 
and
 
restoring
 
the
 
environment’.
 
With
 
13
 
implementation
 
partners
 
on
 
ground,
 
India
 
was
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
countries
 
to
 
have
 
actively
 
supported
 
and
 
implemented
 
the
 
‘Better
 
Cotton’
 
initiatives
 
with
 
its
 
farmers.
 
At
 
present,
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
operational
 
in
 
about
 
6
 
states
 
of
 
India
 
namely
 
-
 
Gujarat,
 
Maharashtra,
 
Punjab,
 
Rajasthan,
 
Telangana
 
and
 
Karnataka.
 
By
 
way
 
of
 
establishing
 
learning
 
groups
 
and
 
producer
 
units,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
aims
 
to
 
capacitate
 
the
 
farmers
 
to
 
adopt
 
sustainable
 
cotton
 
farming
 
practices
 
leading
 
to
 
reduced
 
pesticide
 
usage,
 
optimal
 
fertiliser
 
usage,
 
reduced
 
cultivation
 
costs,
 
improved
 
ﬁbre
 
quality,
 
improved
 
working
 
conditions
 
which
 
is
 
ultimately
 
aimed
 
at
  
bringing
 
about
 
increased
 
volumes
 
of
 
cotton
 
being
 
licensed
 
and
 
sold
 
as
 
‘better’
 
cotton
 
in
 
the
 
global
 
markets
 
.
 
 
 
The
 
signiﬁcance
 
of
 
'better
 
cotton'
 
programs
 
in
 
India
 
becomes
 
imperative
 
in
 
light
 
of
 
the
 
country’s
 
formidable
 
challenges
 
with
 
issues
 
such
 
as
 
climate
 
change,
 
water
 
scarcity,
 
and
 
deteriorating
 
soil
 
health,
 
all
 
of
 
which
 
exacerbate
 
the
 
already
 
daunting
 
issues
 
faced
 
by
 
the
 
country's
 
smallholder
 
cotton
 
farmers.
 
The
 
cultivation
 
of
 
cotton
 
in
 
India
 
is
 
further
 
complicated
 
by
 
persistent
 
pest
 
pressures.
 
Therefore,
 
prioritising
 
and
 
implementing
 
'better
 
cotton'
 
programs
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
address
 
and
 
mitigate
 
the
 
adverse
 
effects
 
of
 
these
 
challenges
 
on
 
India's
 
cotton
 
industry
 
and
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
its
 
farmers.
 
 
CMS’
 
longstanding
 
involvement
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
sector
 
has
 
granted
 
it
 
a
 
profound
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
vital
 
connection
 
between
 
cotton
 
cultivation
 
and
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
it
 
sustains.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
organisation
 
is
 
devoted
 
to
 
partnering
 
with
 
cotton
 
cultivators,
 
picking
 
on
 
the
 
signiﬁcance
 
of
 
cotton
 
as
 
a
 
symbol
 
of
 
sustainability
 
and
 
its
 
role
 
in
 
environmental
 
restoration.
 
Recognizing
 
the
 
intricacies
 
of
 
this
 
agricultural
 
practice,
 
the
 
ﬁrm
 
also
 
aspires
 
to
 
deepen
 
its
 
engagement
 
and
 
contribute
 
meaningfully
 
to
 
the
 
betterment
 
of
 
cultivators'
 
lives.
 
As
 
active
 
proponents
 
of
 
the
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goals,
 
we
 
are
 
steadfast
 
in
 
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
advancing
 
these
 
global
 
objectives.
 
Cotton
 
cultivation,
 
in
 
particular,
 
plays
 
a
 
pivotal
 
role
 
in
 
supporting
 
biodiversity
 
and
 
preserving
 
soil
 
fertility,
 
crucial
 
components
 
for
 
sustainable
 
cultivation.
 
Through
 
our
 
initiatives
 
and
 
partnerships,
 
CMS
 
aims
 
to
 
not
 
only
 
promote
 
sustainable
 
practices
 
but
 
also
 
foster
 
a
 
resilient
 
and
 
thriving
 
ecosystem
 
that
 
beneﬁts
 
both
 
the
 
environment
 
and
 
the
 
communities
 
dependent
 
on
 
cotton
 
cultivation.

Our
 
Understanding
 
of
 
ToR
 
2.1.
 
About
 
the
 
program
 
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
stands
 
as
 
the
 
globe's
 
foremost
 
cotton
 
sustainability
 
initiative.
 
Its
 
mission
 
is
 
dedicated
 
to
 
fostering
 
the
 
survival
 
and
 
prosperity
 
of
 
cotton
 
communities
 
while
 
safeguarding
 
and
 
rejuvenating
 
the
 
health
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
and
 
environment.
 
Through
 
a
 
widespread
 
network
 
of
 
on-the-ground
 
collaborators,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
delivered
 
training
 
on
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
to
 
over
 
2.9
 
million
 
cotton
 
farmers
 
across
 
26
 
nations.
 
The
 
innovative
 
pilot
 
project
 
called
 
-
 
the
 
'Producer
 
Unit
 
Rescoping'
 
(PURE)
 
pilot
 
aims
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
a
 
new,
 
landscape-based
 
approach
 
to
 
implementing
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
system
 
at
 
the
 
farm
 
level
 
to
 
improve
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Instead
 
of
 
the
 
prevailing
 
method
 
that
 
centres
 
solely
 
on
 
speciﬁed
 
(typically
 
male)
 
farmers
 
on
 
a
 
designated
 
list,
 
PURE
 
broadens
 
its
 
scope
 
to
 
encompass
 
all
 
farming
 
households
 
within
 
a
 
deﬁned
 
geographic
 
unit
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
programs.
 
2.1.1
 
Objectives
 
of
 
the
 
Program
 
 
The
 
rescoping
 
approach
 
primarily
 
has
 
the
 
following
 
objectives
 
-
 
 
●
 
Enhance
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
through
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
focusing
 
on
 
natural
 
resources,
 
pest
 
management,
 
labour
 
practices,
 
gender
 
equality,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods.
 
●
 
Improve
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
administration,
 
implementing
 
alternative
 
monitoring
 
methods,
 
and
 
increasing
 
producer
 
unit
 
scale.
 
●
 
Support
 
Better
 
Cotton's
 
traceability
 
goal
 
by
 
strengthening
 
farm-to-gin
 
traceability
 
and
 
eliminating
 
individual
 
farm
 
segregation.
 
2.1.2.
 
Objectives
 
of
 
the
 
Evaluation

the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
program,
 
the
 
overall
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
MEL
 
is
 
to:
 
●
 
Evaluate
 
the
 
feasibility
 
and
 
viability
  
of
 
replicating
 
or
 
scaling
 
up
 
the
 
pilot.
 
●

staff;
 
enabling
 
this
 
time
 
and
 
effort
 
to
 
be
 
spent
 
on
 
other
 
activities
 
more
 
closely
 
tied
 
to
 
impact.
 
○
 
15%
 
increase
 
in

approach.
 
○
 
Increase
 
in
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
eligible
 
for
 
licensing
 
in
 
the

Owing
 
to
 
the

of
 
various
 
factors
 
of

the

○
 
Quantitative
 
analysis
 
-
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
collected
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level
 
will
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
advanced
 
statistical
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
STATA.
 
All
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
carried
 
out
 
in
 
stages.
 
At
 
ﬁrst,
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as
 
mean,
 
median,
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
quartile
 
or
 
decile
 
distribution
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
along
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
to
 
measure
 
KPIs.
 
Then
 
as
 
a
 
second
 
step,
 
causality
 
would
 
be
 
established
 
using
 
evaluation
 
methods
 
as
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
methodology
 
adopted
 
for
 
this
 
evaluation.
 
This
 
will
 
provide
 
impact
 
estimates
 
for
 
the
 
program.
 
 
○
 
Qualitative
 
analysis
 
-
 
The
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
(FGDs
 
/
 
KIIs)
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
would
 
provide
 
an
 
insight
 
into
 
the
 
practices
 
seen
 
on
 
the
 
ground
 
vis-a-vis
 
the
 
responses
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
assessment.
 
We
 
will
 
prepare
 
thematic
 
coding
 
to
 
identify
 
patterns
 
in
 
data,
 
draw
 
narratives
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
triangulate
 
the
 
inferences
 
gathered
 
from
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data.
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
analyse
 
the
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collected
 
through
 
the
 
KIIs
 
using
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Nvivo
 
or
 
Atlas.ti.
 
○
 
The
 
program
 
MEL
 
objectives
 
and
 
KPIs
 
(measured
 
through
 
the
 
quantitative
 
survey)
 
would
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
the
 
OECD
 
DAC
 
deﬁned
 
six
 
evaluation
 
criteria
 
–
 
relevance,
 
coherence,
 
effectiveness,
 
efﬁciency,
 
impact
 
and
 
sustainability
 
(RCEEIS).
 
Application
 
of
 
these
 
criteria
 
on
 
the
 
indicators
 
would
 
help
 
us
 
determine
 
if
 
the
 
intervention
 
aligns
 
with
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
and
 
the
 
region,
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
compatible
 
with
 
other
 
interventions
 
in
 
the
 
region,
 
if
 
the
 
project
 
goals
 
have
 
been
 
met,
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
met
 
in
 
an

and
 
timely

and
 
the

○
 
Economic
 
Evaluation
 
(Cost
 
Effectiveness
 
Analysis)
 
-
 
The
 
method
 
of
 
Cost-effectiveness
 
analysis
 
(CEA)
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
determining
 
the
 
‘efﬁciency’
 
parameter
 
of
 
RCEEIS.
 
CEA
 
provides
 
the
 
outcomes
 
of
 
the
 
investment
 
in
 
programs
 
as
 
a
 
simple
 
ratio
 
of
 
costs
 
to
 
impacts.
 
This
 
helps
 
us
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
measure
 
to
 
compare
 
the
 
cost
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
different

would
 
be

to
 
understand
 
the

Post
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
gaps
 
in
 
the
 
present
 
monitoring
 
systems,
 
newer
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
monitoring
 
mechanisms
 
could
 
be
 
deployed
 
which

more
 
suitable
 
for
 
the

PURE
 
approach
 
of
 
implementing
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
programs.
 
 
At
 
the
 
endline,
 
the
 
evaluation
 
approach
 
could
 
look
 
at
 
a

3.2.
 
Monitoring
 
and
 
Evaluation
 
Framework
 
3.2.1.
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
The
 
new
 
community-centric
 
approach
 
of
 
rescoping
 
boundaries
 
of
 
the
 
producer
 
units
 
is
 
mainly
 
intended
 
to
 
solve
 
for
 
the
 
shortcomings
 
of
 
the
 
previous
 
approach
 
of
 
using
 
farmer
 
lists
 
for
 
selecting
 
farmers
 
for
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
programs.
 
For
 
the
 
pilot
 
project,
 
the
 
3
 
producer
 
units
 
of
 
INTL01,
 
INTL02
 
and
 
INTL23
 
covering
 
most
 
of
 
Karim
 
Nagar
 
district
 
and
 
some
 
parts
 
of
 
Warangal
 
district
 
in
 
Telangana
 
are
 
being
 
rescoped
 
to
 
form
 
1
 
large
 
producer
 
unit.
 
The
 
rescoped
 
producer
 
unit
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
cater
 
to
 
a
 
larger
 
number
 
of
 
farmers
 
(~10,000
 
per
 
PU
 
in
 
contrast
 
to
 
~3000
 
per
 
PU
 
initially)
 
and
 
cover
 
a
 
larger
 
geographical
 
area
 
(~5000
 
hectares)
 
as
 
well.
  
 
The
 
new
 
approach
 
intends
 
to
 
do
 
away
 
with
 
the
 
pitfalls
 
of
 
the
 
previous
 
approach
 
of
 
having
 
to
 
invest
 
massive
 
efforts
 
in
 
maintaining
 
and
 
validating
 
farmer
 
lists
 
every
 
year
 
while
 
predominantly
 
focusing
 
on
 
male
 
farmers.
 
The
 
farm
 
to
 
gin
 
traceability
 
system
 
was
 
also
 
proving
 
to
 
be
 
arduous
 
in
 
the
 
initial
 
farmer
 
lists
 
approach,
 
given
 
the
 
challenges
 
of
 
segregating
  
‘better’
 
cotton
 
from
 
the
 
regular
 
cotton.
    
 
Rescoping
 
the
 
boundaries
 
of
 
the
 
producer
 
units
 
is
 
envisaged
 
to
 
have
 
multi-pronged
 
and
 
cascading
 
beneﬁts.
 
The
 
administrative
 
burden
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
workers
 
would
 
be
 
heavily
 
reduced,
 
leading
 
to
 
them
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
spend
 
more
 
time
 
on
 
the
 
capacity
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers.
 
The
 
impetus
 
for
 
the
 
program
 
farmers
 
then
 
-
 
to
 
change
 
their
 
behaviour
 
and
 
adopt
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
like
 
reducing
 
fertiliser
 
/
 
pesticide
 
usage,
 
optimal
 
use
 
of
 
resources
 
for
 
soil,
 
water
 
and
 
land
 
conservation
 
-
 
increases
 
manifold
 
by
 
virtue
 
of
 
the
 
nudges
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
workers
  
/
 
trainers
 
on
 
one
 
hand
 
and
 
their
 
peers
 
on
 
the
 
other.
 
Consistent
 
adoption
 
of
 
sustainable
 
cotton
 
farming
 
practices
 
in
 
the
 
region
 
then
 
implies
 
ease
 
of
 
segregating
 
and
 
licensing
 
the
 
cotton
 
as
 
‘Better
 
Cotton’.
  
The
 
above
 
cascading
 
effects
 
are
 
diagrammatically
 
represented
 
below
 
in
 
the
 
theory
 
of
 
change
 
for
 
the
 
program

Program
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
The
 
formative
 
evaluation
 
essentially
 
seeks
 
to
 
set
 
baseline
 
indicators
 
for
 
testing
 
and
 
validating
 
the
 
proposed
 
theory
 
of
 
change
 
at
 
the
 
endline.
 
The
 
development
 
of
 
Key
 
Performance
 
indicators
 
for
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
pilot
 
project
 
and
 
the
 
tools
 
then
 
rests
 
fundamentally
 
on
 
understanding
 
each
 
of
 
the
 
activities
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
in
 
detail.
 
Hence,
 
to
 
begin
 
with,
 
we
 
would
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
in-depth
 
discussions
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
teams
 
working
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
Our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
activities
 
at
 
present
 
(based
 
on
 
the
 
review
 
of
 
documents
 
shared)
 
and
 
the
 
queries
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
are
 
listed
 
below
 
-
 
 
1.
 
PU
 
governance
 
and
 
staff
 
structure
 
-
 
It
 
is
 
understood
 
that
 
the
 
stafﬁng
 
structure
 
will
 
undergo
 
a
 
dramatic
 
change
 
post
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
intervention.
 
A
 
rescoped
 
PU
 
will
 
function
 
under
 
a
 
uniﬁed
 
management
 
system,
 
with
 
a
 
singular
 
set
 
of
 
administrative
 
and
 
documentation
 
requirements.
 
The
 
primary
 
unit
 
of
 
implementation
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
‘Village’,
 
and
 
not
 
the
 
‘Learning
 
Groups’
 
developed
 
for
 
the
 
regular
 
implementation
 
mode.
 
The
 
Project
 
managers
 
would
 
be
 
Programme
 
Partner
 
staff,
 
same
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
model.
 
The
 
rescoped
 
PU
 
would
 
be
 
overseen
 
and
 
administered
 
by
 
a
 
board
 
of
 
managers
 
as
 
opposed
 
to
 
just
 
one
 
PU
 
Manager.
 
This
 
board
 
would
 
comprise
 
one
 
PU
 
Manager
 
(PUM)
 
responsible
 
for
 
overall
 
administration
 
and
 
management
 
(including
 
HR,
 
planning
 
and
 
priority
 
setting,
 
overseeing
 
the
 
management
 
system,
 
etc.),
 
one
 
Manager
 
dedicated
 
to
 
Capacity
 
Strengthening
 
and
 
fostering
 
necessary
 
technical
 
expertise,
 
and
 
one
 
Manager
 
focused
 
on
 
Data,
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation,
 
and
 
Documentation
 
purposes.
 
The
 
board
 
of
 
managers
 
would
 
be
 
assisted
 
by
 
Associate
 
Managers,
 
each
 
responsible
 
for
 
implementation
 
within
 
speciﬁc
 
geographical
 
sub-units.
 
As
 
the
 
PURE
 
model
 
shifts
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
individualistic
 
farmer-based
 
approach
 
to
 
embrace
 
a
 
broader
 
perspective,
 
Field
 
Facilitators
 
(FFs)
 
could
 
establish
 
committees
 
at
 
the
 
village
 
level.
 
These
 
committees
 
may
 
include
 
lead
 
farmers,
 
progressive
 
farmers,
 
demonstration
 
farmers,
 
and
 
other
 
relevant
 
members
 
to
 
facilitate

ﬁeld
 
activities,
 
and
 
support
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
monitoring
 
efforts.
 
A
 
thorough
 
knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
and
 
old
 
governance
 
structures
 
is
 
necessary
 
for
 
deﬁning
 
indicators
 
for
 
the
 
outcome
 
associated
 
with
 
reduction
 
in
 
data
 
and
 
administration
 
costs.
 
2.
 
Periodic
 
baseline
 
and
 
a
 
new
 
assurance
 
model
 
-
 
The
 
new
 
monitoring
 
system
 
for
 
the
 
program
 
seems
 
to
 
rely
 
more
 
on
 
primary
 
data
 
collected
 
in
 
a
 
digitised
 
format
 
at
 
the
 
community
 
level
 
(from
 
FPOs)
 
or
 
from
 
periodic
 
baseline
 
studies
 
and
 
utilises
 
secondary
 
sources
 
of
 
data
 
like
 
government
 
data
 
or
 
gin
 
procurement
 
volumes.
 
Other
 
secondary
 
data
 
like
 
satellite
 
imagery,
 
community
 
data
 
and
 
interviews
 
in
 
schools
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
triangulation
 
of
 
information.
 
For
 
answering
 
the
 
evaluation
 
questions
 
pertaining
 
to
 
this
 
activity
 
and
 
its
 
outcomes,
 
we
 
would
 
need
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
existing
 
data
 
value
 
chain
 
and
 
the
 
newer
 
modiﬁcations
 
to
 
it
 
clearly
 
and
 
in
 
detail
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
tools
 
and
 
the
 
indicators
 
can
 
be
 
developed
 
to
 
probe
 
into
 
the
 
efforts
 
(time,
 
cost,
 
physical
 
and
 
mental)
 
required
 
for
 
collecting
 
data
 
for
 
the
 
new
 
approach
 
vis-à-vis
 
the
 
previous
 
one.
      
 
3.
 
Participation
 
in
 
community-based
 
capacity
 
building
 
activities
 
-
 
The
 
intensiﬁcation
 
of
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
efforts
 
by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
resources,
 
directed
 
at
 
the
 
community
 
instead
 
of
 
individual
 
farmers
 
on
 
predeﬁned
 
lists,
 
are
 
supposed
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
effective
 
in
 
driving
 
awareness
 
and
 
increased
 
adoption
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
practices.
 
Field
 
Facilitators
 
will
 
be
 
assigned
 
villages
 
instead
 
of
 
Learning
 
Groups
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
accountable
 
for
 
implementation
 
with
 
all
 
cotton
 
farming
 
households
 
in
 
the
 
assigned
 
villages,
 
rather
 
than
 
solely
 
focusing
 
on
 
farmers
 
listed
 
on
 
the
 
farmers
 
list.
  
However,
 
one
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
duly
 
cognizant
 
of
 
the
 
following
 
aspects.
 
a.
 
Systemic
 
non-compliance
 
-
 
A
 
dichotomy
 
arises
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
voluntary
 
on
 
one
 
hand
 
while
 
licensing,
 
on
 
the
 
other,
 
is
 
intended
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
for
 
all
 
farmers
 
at
 
the
 
community
 
level.
 
This
 
situation
 
then
 
could
 
inadvertently
 
incentivise
 
non-compliance.
 
Free-riders
 
can
 
partake
 
in
 
the
 
beneﬁts
 
that
 
the
 
active
 
producer
 
unit
 
participants
 
would
 
get.
 
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
motivation
 
behind
 
and
 
extent
 
of
 
participation
 
in
 
such
 
a
 
scenario,
 
it
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
know
 
the
 
criteria
 
for
 
shortlisting
 
farmers,
 
their
 
motivation
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
programs,
 
the
 
processes
 
followed
 
to
 
onboard
 
them
 
into
 
the
 
program,
 
extent
 
of
 
non-compliance
 
allowed
 
and
 
the
 
penalties
 
for
 
not
 
complying
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
requirements.
 
Further,
 
frequency,
 
duration
 
and
 
type
 
of
 
engagement
 
of
 
the
 
farmers
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
understand
 
as
 
well
 
-
 
this
 
entails
 
understanding
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
interaction
 
between
 
the
 
farmer
 
and
 
the
 
ﬁeldworker
 
and
 
the
 
expectations
 
from
 
both
 
parties.
               
 
b.
 
Focus
 
on
 
women
 
participation
 
-
 
Increasing
 
participation
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
intervention.
 
However,
 
to
 
evaluate
 
this
 
objective
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
deﬁnition
 
of
 
women
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
-
 
is
 
the
 
program
 
looking
 
at
 
building
 
the
 
capacity
 
of
 
women
 
for
 
any
 
speciﬁc
 
program
 
activities?
 
What
 
about
 
their
 
role
 
in
 
decision
 
making?
 
How
 
will
 
women's
 
roles
 
and
 
responsibilities
 
in
 
cotton
 
farming
 
differ
 
from
 
the

that
 
they
 
already
 
do?
 
How
 
would
 
their
 
increased
 
participation
 
in
 
cotton
 
farming
 
affect
 
their
 
domestic
 
responsibilities?

Monitoring
 
Evaluation
 
and
 
Learning
 
-
 
The
 
approaches
 
of
 
replication,
 
estimation
 
or
 
hybrid
 
will
 
be
 
tested
 
to
 
check
 
for
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
way
 
of
 
monitoring
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
pilot.
 
The
 
data
 
collection
 
could
 
either
 
‘replicate’
 
the
 
way
 
data
 
is
 
currently
 
collected
 
by
 
PUs
 
or
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
collected
 
via
 
‘estimation’
 
which
 
could
 
involve
 
estimating
 
the
 
data
 
at
 
a
 
broader
 
geographic
 
level
 
(from
 
sources
 
such
 
as
 
GIS
 
maps,
 
local
 
traders,
 
ginners
 
etc)
 
rather
 
than
 
per
 
individual
 
farmer.
 
However,
 
for
 
the
 
pilot,
 
utilising
 
the
 
hybrid
 
approach
 
of
 
collecting
 
data
 
for
 
all
 
indicators
 
using
 
both
 
the
 
replication
 
and
 
the
 
estimation
 
approach
 
is
 
being
 
proposed.
  
Results
 
from
 
both
 
the
 
methods
 
would
 
then
 
be
 
compared
 
for
 
better
 
understanding
 
of
 
options
 
for
 
the
 
future.

Segregation
 
of
 
Cotton
 
and
 
Traceability
 
-
 
So
 
as
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
traceability
 
systems,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
process
 
followed
 
for
 
segregation
 
of
 
‘better’
 
cotton
 
from
 
the
 
regular
 
one,
 
the
 
traceability
 
and
 
licensing
 
measures
 
adhered
 
to
 
on
 
the
 
ground
 
at
 
present,
 
the
 
dynamics
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
output
 
value
 
chain
 
(from
 
post
 
harvest
 
to
 
ginning)
 
and
 
the
 
changes
 
that
 
this
 
system
 
has
 
undergone
 
post
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
with
 
rescoped
 
boundaries.
 
Knowledge
 
of
 
this
 
system
 
is
 
crucial
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
determine
 
indicators
 
for
 
assessing
 
traceability.
    
 
3.2.3.
 
High
 
level
 
Indicators
 
 
The
 
indicators
 
and
 
tools
 
could
 
be
 
suitably
 
designed
 
only
 
once
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
thorough
 
and
 
detailed
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Program.
 
However,
 
based
 
on
 
our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
pilot
 
project
 
at
 
present,
 
we

Gender
 
Analysis
 
Framework
2
 
The
 
Gender
 
analysis
 
framework
 
essentially
 
provides
 
a
 
lens
 
to
 
understand
 
participation
 
of
 
farmers
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
activities
 
from
 
the
 
perspectives
 
of
 
-
 
Gender
 
based
 
division
 
of
 
labour;
 
Gender
 
based
  
access,
 
ownership
  
and
 
control
 
over
 
resources;
 
Gender
 
based
 
decision
 
making;
 
and
 
Empowerment
 
across
 
gender
 
identities.
 
This
 
framework,
 
originally
 
known
 
as
 
the
 
Harvard
 
Analytical
 
Framework
 
(developed
 
in
 
1985)
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
type
 
and
 
amount
 
of
 
work
 
men
 
and
 
women
 
do
 
in
 
a
 
household,
 
in
 
cotton
 
farming,
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
community.
 
It
 
also
 
helps
 
document
 
the
 
differences
 
in
 
the
 
gendered
 
access
 
and
 
control
 
of
 
resources,
 
such
 
as
 
land,
 
water,
 
seeds
 
or
 
extension
 
information.
 
The
 
gender

framework
 
at

3.3.
 
Execution
 
Approach
 
The
 
baseline
 
study
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
pilot
 
will
 
measure
 
the
 
values
 
of
 
program
 
indicators
 
before
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
PURE
 
intervention
 
so
 
that
 
one
 
can
 
compare
 
these
 
with
 
the
 
indicators
 
measured
 
post
 
the
 
intervention
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
pilot.
  
Based
 
on
 
our
 
review
 
of
 
the
 
documents
 
shared
 
on
 
the
 
PU
 
pilot
 
and
 
the
 
key
 
performance
  
indicators,
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
revisions
 
proposed
 
to
 
the
 
evaluation
 
approach
 
shared
 
previously
 
are
 
as
 
follows
 
-
 
●
 
Deﬁning
 
output
 
indicators
 
in
 
alignment
 
with
 
the
 
KPIs
 
-
 
A
 
thorough
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
and
 
the
 
intervention
 
(the
 
PU
 
approach
 
being
 
followed
 
currently
 
and
 
the
 
PURE
 
approach
 
respectively)
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
deﬁne
 
output
 
indicators
 
for
 
certain
 
outcomes
 
(such
 
as
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
MEL
 
and
 
assurance,
 
data
 
and
 
administration,
 
credibility
 
etc)
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
team.
 
Clarity
 
on
 
the
 
indicators
 
is
 
important
 
given
 
that
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
monitored
 
at
 
the
 
baseline
 
and
 
the
 
endline
 
and
 
will
 
effectively
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
gauge
 
the
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
pilot
 
program.
 
The
 
indicators
 
will
 
also
 
feed
 
into
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collection
 
instruments
 
for
 
the
 
study.
 
Multiple
 
conversations
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
WWF
 
teams
 
would
 
be
 
required
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
get
 
this
 
step
 
right.
    
 
●
 
Methods
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
-
 
While
 
changes
 
to
 
the
 
sampling
 
numbers
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
proposed
 
at
 
present
 
(assuming
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
accounted
 
for
 
the
 
appropriate
 
number
 
of
 
samples
 
for
 
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collection),
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
methods
 
will
 
be
 
revised
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
the
 
indicator
 
measured.
 
 
○
 
We
 
now
 
understand
 
that
 
data
 
on
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
indicators
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
farmers
 
reached,
 
number
 
of
 
trainings
 
attended,
 
quantity
 
of
 
cotton
 
produced,
 
yield
 
etc
 
would
 
be
 
available
 
to
 
us
 
from
 
the
 
program
 
MIS
 
(farmer
 
ﬁeld
 
books
 
etc)
 
and
  
information
 
for
 
such
 
indicators
 
need
 
not
 
be
 
collected
 
through
 
quantitative
 
surveys.
 
The
 
program
 
MIS
 
would
 
be
 
thoroughly
 
leveraged
 
to
 
get
 
data
 
on
 
such
 
relevant
 
indicators
 
at
 
the
 
baseline.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
questionnaire
 
then
 
would
 
be
 
designed
 
such
 
that
 
it
 
focuses
 
more
 
on
 
capturing
 
the
 
change
 
in
 
knowledge,
 
attitude
 
and
 
practices
 
of
 
the
 
farmers.
    
 
○
 
Since
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
measure
 
a
 
15%
 
decrease
 
in
 
the
 
effort
 
spent
 
by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
on
 
data
 
and
 
administration,
 
it
 
is
 
critical
 
that
 
all
 
information
 
for
 
this
 
outcome
 
be
 
measured
 
quantitatively.
 
Hence,
 
for
 
a
 
predetermined
 
sample
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
(selected
 
accounting
 
for
 
factors
 
of
 
heterogeneity
 
such
 
as
 
block,
 
village,
 
gender,
 
mode
 
of
 
transport
 
etc),
 
information
 
on
 
effort
 
required
 
for
 
administrative
 
work
 
would
 
be
 
measured
 
quantitatively
 
along
 
with
 
qualitative
 
tools
 
being
 
employed
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
intangible
 
aspects
 
of
 
their
 
work
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
face,
 
their
 
motivation
 
etc

However,
 
any
 
such

a
 
later
 
stage
 
and
 
ﬁnalised
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
the
 
Better

team
 
once
 
we
 
have
 
developed
 
a

3.4.
 
Quality
 
Control
 
Mechanism
 
With
 
over
 
200
 
projects
 
and
 
an
 
in-house
 
portfolio
 
for
 
data
 
collection,
 
CMS
 
has
 
strong
 
expertise
 
in
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
CMS
 
has
 
an
 
expert
 
network
 
of
 
senior
 
enumerators
 
with
 
strong
 
domain
 
knowledge
 
and
 
past
 
experience
 
of
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
sector.
 
They
 
are
 
also
 
trained
 
on
 
research
 
ethics
 
and
 
the
 
collection
 
of
 
sensitive
 
information,
 
etc.
 
The
 
selection
 
of
 
enumerators
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
stringent
 
measures,
 
and
 
they
 
are
 
assessed
 
for
 
quality
 
throughout
 
the
 
project.
 
CMS
 
will
 
ensure
 
that
 
100%
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
researchers
 
selected
 
are
 
local
 
in
 
nature.
 
They
 
know
 
the
 
Telugu
 
language,
 
dialect,
 
customs,
 
and
 
culture.
 
They
 
also
 
easily
 
understand
 
the
 
local
 
terminologies
 
used,
 
giving
 
them
 
a
 
stronger
 
connection
 
and
 
rapport
 
between
 
researcher
 
and
 
Respondents.
 
A
 
detailed
 
training
 
and
 
orienting
 
process
 
would
 
be
 
conducted
 
prior
 
to
 
commencement
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
exercise.
 
Training
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
on
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
including
 
programme
 
background,
 
objectives
 
and
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
study,
 
sampling
 
techniques
 
and
 
replacement
 
methodology,
 
discussion
 
on
 
each
 
question
 
with
 
probing
 
methods,
 
logistics
 
planning
 
and
 
support.
 
Given
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
the
 
respondent
 
type,
 
gender
 
sensitivity
 
training
 
will
 
be
 
administered
 
tailored
 
to
 
speciﬁc
 
needs
 
and
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
population.
 
A
 
scientiﬁc
 
approach
 
to
 
the
 
training
 
process
 
will
 
be
 
ensured
 
by
 
creating
 
standard
 
training
 
protocols,
 
manuals
 
including
 
standardisation
 
in
 
survey
 
techniques.
 
Mock
 
surveys
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
days
 
are
 
planned
 
for
 
the
 
team
 
for
 
in-ﬁeld
 
experience
 
with
 
the
 
software
 
and
 
survey
 
tool.
 
Further,
 
the
 
enumerators
 
are
 
trained
 
to
 
hold
 
all
 
biases,
 
opinions,
 
claims,
 
and
 
other
 
features
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
associated
 
with
 
individuals.
 
They
 
will
 
also
 
sign
 
a
 
conﬁdentiality
 
agreement
 
with
 
CMS
 
agreeing
 
to
 
use
 
conﬁdential
 
information
 
only
 
for
 
the
 
purposes
 
set
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
training,
 
and
 
not
 
disclose
 
the
 
information
 
to
 
any
 
other
 
party.
 
The
 
enumerators
 
will
 
be
 
trained
 
on
 
the
 
understanding
 
to
 
not
 
copy
 
or
 
retain
 
or
 
share
 
any
 
written
 
information
 
or
 
record
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
associated
 
with
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
individuals
 
or
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
any
 
sort,
 
after
 
the
 
study
 
period.
 
And
 
that
 
at
 
the
 
conclusion
 
of
 
the
 
surveys
 
all
 
conﬁdential
 
information,
 
including
 
questionnaires,
 
written
 
notes,
 
photographs,
 
or
 
other
 
types
 
of
 
notes
 
taken
 
would
 
be
 
given
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
team.
 
During
 
data
 
collection,
 
monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspects
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring
 
enumerator
 
quality
 
controls
 
with
 
spot
 
checks,
 
back
 
checks
 
(on
 
major
 
topics,
 
time
 
taken,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
looping
 
mechanisms.
 
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes
 
for
 
data
 
management.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.
 
 
Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated

FF1 - Vanitha 
(INTL 23)- Vanita has been the FF for 4 months and has 7 to 8 villages under 
her and every village has 40 to 50 farmers. 
- She likes training the most and given an option would like to 
reduce her data work (T able) 
- Farmers List: She is responsible for collecting data - name of the farmer, 
acres, irrigation, contact nos. Etc.  She cross checks the data with farmer = 
Computer 
- Attendance: She maintains the LG book where farmers are supposed to 
sign after the meeting. = Hardcopy 
- Training &amp; CS activities:  She conducts farmer trainings
- Adoption:  She conducts demos to show how to do sowing of inter crops 
and how to use the bio fertilizers. She also motivates them to adopt 
sustainable practices. 
- RIR -  She is responsible for cross checking data in FFB. Sometimes 
farmers inflate costs and they are quickly able to understand because 
they have data from other farmers. 
FFB - She assists farmers in filling the FFB, then signs and takes a picture 
of it for record.
- Vanitas day starts at 7:30 AM &gt;&gt; goes to the field then goes to 
office after lunch - enters data from morning sessions 
- She is assisted by the APU manager and PU manager at times 
- Training timings are discussed and finalized on whatsapp 
groups, at times
- Daily activities - calling farmers to arrange for training, 
conducting the trainings, data &amp; admin work, Female farmer 
trainings 
- During training she makes use of Flex and believes that it is 
very useful for farmers to understand concepts easily. Farmers 
also find it easier to grasp concepts when shown through 
pictures on a flex.
- T opics covered: Water management, biodiversity, soil health 
management, storage of cotton. 
- Nearly 20 to 30 farmers participate in every training session. 
- Farmers who miss the training, FF goes and meets them on field 
and educates them on the topics that he or she missed. 
- After meetings, farmers who have attended the training are 
made to sign in the LG book. 
- She maintains a diary for noting all points related to the 
trainings 
- Soil testing is also conducted - after the results she goes and 
talks to them and advises them, if need be.  
- In a month she conducts 3 to 4 meetings 
- Till date, two rallies have been held on PPE Kits and child 
labour. - Administration: ½ hr - diary entry, 2-3 hours office data work 
- During season there is data entry work every day which takes 2 to 3 
hours daily 
- Off season it is only 1-2 hours 
- Overall : 50-70% time goes in admin work on a monthly basis - 
Farmers list  - 10 to 15 mins daily 
- Attendance list - 15 to 10 mins daily 
- Capacity strengthening - 3 hours daily 
- Adoption - ½ - 1 hour daily 
- RIR - 1 hour 
- FFB - ½ hour 
- Demo - weekly once -2 hours 
- Overall - Admin: 30%, Data work: 40%, CS: 20 to 30%  
- She wants to spend more time on training because excessive data 
work gives her shoulder and eye pain and she finds interacting with 
farmers more fruitful. 
- Given an option she would reduce her data entry work
- Motivation for being FF - Vanita used to previously deal with farmers 
and also work in the children's rights domain. She enjoys farming and 
believes that women farmers have more ideas than men. She said that 
BC encourages farmers to share their ideas and keep them inspired. 
Additionally, she believes that the highest profits are reaped from 
farming the organic way. 
- Highest impact work : Training, phone follows ups, one to one 
interactions with farmers and field workers.
- Vanitha believes that data is very important as it tells us a story and 
based on that they conduct the trainings.
Incorrect data and delays in data sharing involving 
repeated follow up which becomes time consuming. - As per Vanita, doing organic farming yields higher quality 
cotton 
- As per Vanita, her  responsibilities which will benefit the 
farmers more is - an increase in her field time and scheduling 
meetings as per farmers availability (in the afternoon instead 
of morning) 
- Vanita feels that there is scope for improvement  in 
efficiency of admin work and also she feels she can increase 
her knowledge in order to provide more information to the 
farmers.
When asked about her overall experience, she said she 
has gathered more information to communicate with 
farmers in BCI, performed soil testing, and visited 
farmers' gatherings in village GPs. Field notes_FF_Vanita
FF2 - Rakesh 
(INTL 02)- Rakesh has six villages and 445 farmers under him 
- He has been FF since 2 years 
- When asked about the tools for management, used by FF, 
Rakesh mentioned that  he uses his mobile phone for almost every 
work. He has to click photos and share with PUM on a daily basis - 
this leads to a lot of data and ultimately hangs up his phone. He 
said it would be nice if BC would provide them with tabs.
Attendance:  Minutes of every meeting / training is made by the FF. If he 
cannot make it in the meeting then he goes to his office and prepares the 
detailed version. Sign of every farmer is also taken in the LG attendance 
book after every meeting.  
FFB: Rakesh helping illiterate farmers in filling FFB. He said that literate 
farmers are able to fill the data correctly and the illiterate farmers usually 
make mistakes so we tell them to carry it during the meeting.  
Adoption data: - Rakesh said that he has the printout of the adoption data 
table and as per every farmer - the practices he follows, he ticks the 
relevant practices. 
- This data is then sent to the PUM - who further checks it and then enters 
in the computer. 
RIR:  FF has nothing to do with RIR - only from FFB transfer to excel - this 
excel is an internal doc made by WWF (not as complex as RIR) - He meets with minimum 2 LGs per day 
- As per season training topics are taken up , one meeting lasts 
for one hour. 
- 1 LG - 1 adoption sheet 
- 15 days - training on 1 topic across all villages under him- FFs 
discuss with PUMs on topics to teach farmers. The meetings are 
conducted by Rakesh alone ( no supporting staff) - only some 
meetings PUM attend like on child labour, only-women meetings 
- once a month. APUM checks once in 15 days if we are having 
meetings or not. 
- General topics covered: soil health, biodiversity, how to 
increase fertility of land, reduction in water pollution, etc.
- Rakesh said that they provide green gram and red gram seeds 
to RA (regenerative agriculture) Demo farmers, not all the 
farmers. By helping reduce their investment costs, we've gained 
their trust, and they attend our meetings regularly. As a 
voluntary organization, we share valuable information, which 
strengthens their trust in us. During meetings, we explain the use 
of combination medicines, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, 
which encourages their continued participation.
- When asked on how he reaches out to farmers who do not 
attend meetings - he said he does home visits, follows up with 
them on phone and gives them a download of all the topics 
discussed and urges them to attend the following meetings. 
- Rakesh mentioned that he sometimes goes to SHG meetings 
where he finds all the women - he educates them on kitchen 
gardening, tailoring, knowledge on PPE kits, etc. 
- Once the cotton is plucked, Rakesh provides suggestions on 
storage - for eg. to keep it away from water, open storage better, 
etc. - His day starts at 6:30 AM, farmers are already informed about the 
meeting the previous evening. He gives training for one hour followed 
by field visits / observations: 30 mins 
- Office work : 3 hours 
- In may &amp; dec - well monitoring - 3 villages 
- Overall: Admin: 20% , Data: 30%, Capacity strengthening: 50% 
- Rakesh mentioned that he doesn't like (feels it is a time waste) to 
transfer well monitoring data from field to g sheets - it is not required 
- He said that instead this time could be used to train farmers who are 
not growing cotton but other crops like maize, paddy, etc. 
- When asked about the time taken for Farmers list - Rakesh said it 
takes 15 to 20 minutes from each farmer and it takes 2 to 3 days to 
collect info from one village and for all villages under him 10 to 15 
days (annually - since farmer list is updated every year) 
When asked about what he would like to work more upon and what work 
he would like to reduce - 
- He said he would like it if data documentation work was reduced. 
Few farmers do not update / enter the wrong data -in their FFB, as a 
result of which data for RIR gets affected. When asked about how he 
knows that the correct info is filled in FFB he mentioned that the 
literate farmers fill data properly and he helps the illiterate ones. 
- Rakesh is interested in conducting training 
- He said that data is important as it supports farmers indirectly and 
also helps in monitoring their work.
- Previously, farmers were investing Rs. 18,000 per acre, but now their 
expenditure has reduced to less than Rs. 15,000. 
- Before participating in the BCI project, farmers were heavily using 
DAP based on their own knowledge, but it wasn't yielding the 
expected results. 
- Rakesh also mentioned that they are providing vegetable seeds and 
connecting farmers with tailoring units, while also supplying more 
seeds for kitchen gardens.
- Through their Sustainable Land Management efforts, they have 
distributed plants to farmers in partnership with WWF. Additionally, 
they also provide border crops, such as coconut trees, to protect farm 
boundaries and help retain soil moisture.
Motivation of Rakesh: 
- “I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers 
strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. 
These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about 
serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply 
inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” 
- Rakesh feels immense pride that he has been able to reduce fertilizer 
usage which led to increase by 10 to 12 quintals per acre  
- When asked what he feels has been the impact of his work - &quot;I never 
recommend using pesticides; instead, I advocate for organic fertilizers like 
neem oil and homemade preparations. We use Agni Asram, neem, and 
Jeevamrutham, all of which are prepared on agricultural land. The soil 
quality has remained stable. We’ve organized rallies in villages to 
discourage the use of red-colored pesticides. During meetings, we 
conducted an intercropping demonstration using green grams, which not 
only increased soil carbon but also provided farmers with an additional 
income. We are also developing vermicompost.&quot; 
- Rakesh has till date conducted over 50 trainings for farmers - he 
conducts meetings with other stakeholders too like workers, schools, 
ANMs, etc.) 
- Overall, Rakesh said he feels he has created a 70% impact and there 
is still scope for improvement. 
- As per Rakesh, there is a clear difference between BCI &amp; non-BCI 
cotton - quality, color and fibre, etc.  
- As per Rakesh, the highest impact of his work has been by educating 
farmers on bio pest, cow urine and cow dung - T o have meetings at night (6:30 to 8:30 PM) - since farmers 
are free at that time 
- Rakesh feels that the cultivation of Better Cotton is on 
the rise. He particularly appreciates the use of bio-
pesticides and the preparation of neem oil by farmers. - A 
mixture of 5 kg cow dung, 5 liters of cow urine, 5 kg of 
jaggery, and soil is also used, and he finds this method 
effective. 
- Farmers are also preparing and using Trichoderma, 
which he highly values. Stem application is another 
method he favors; out of 30 farmers, 20 are using it. - This 
technique effectively eradicates sucking insects. What he 
loves most about stem application is that it prevents soil 
and environmental pollution, unlike spraying, which can 
cause harm. By applying directly to the plant stem, we 
ensure no damage to the soil or the environment.
(about stem application usage: Sixty percent of farmers are 
using stem application. Just 250 ml is sufficient for two acres. 
While spraying costs around Rs. 1,000, stem application costs 
only Rs. 200. It also saves time, taking just one hour compared 
to two for spraying. Overall, the investment is significantly 
lower. This method has been implemented since two years)

providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all 
activities align with the program’s objectives.
Documentation: Maintain and verify Farmer Field Books (FFBs), 
write in diaries, and submit meeting minutes and signatures to the 
Field Manager.Data Collection and Validation: Collect data from Lead Farmers, validate 
farmer lists through physical visits and phone calls, and update records 
accordingly. Ensure the accuracy of data by cross-checking information.
Monitoring Farmer Practices: Monitor farmers' adherence to guidelines, 
especially regarding the use of organic fertilizers and pesticides, and 
follow up to ensure continued compliance.
Result Indicator Reporting (RIR): Track and report on key performance 
indicators related to farmer practices and crop outcomes.
Data Validation: Cross-check data over the phone and through physical 
visits. Ensure data is updated and accurate.
Monitoring: Regularly monitor farmer practices, particularly the use of 
organic fertilizers and adherence to guidelines.

and awareness meetings with farmers on topics such as crop 
management, pesticide use, and environmental protection. Use 
Farmer Field Books (FFBs) to educate farmers on record-
keeping.
Material Distribution and Demonstrations: Distribute 
educational materials like flexes, demonstrate techniques such 
as using sticky traps, and share videos via WhatsApp groups to 
reinforce training.
Promoting Sustainable Practices: Encourage the adoption of 
sustainable farming practices, including the use of Navadhanyalu 
(nine types of seeds) and reducing the use of chemical pesticides.
Training Sessions: 30-40 minutes per session.
Field Visits: Daily from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with specific timings for 
meetings and fieldwork.
Post Noon - Office works mostlyEnvironmental Benefits: Reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, 
increased use of organic fertilizers, and improved environmental 
protection.
Farmer Benefits: Increased yield, reduced investment, and improved 
education for farmer children due to higher profits.
Adoption of Practices: High adoption rate of guidelines among 
farmers, 80% following the recommended practices.Data Management: Ensuring accurate data collection 
and validation can be time-consuming 
Farmer Engagement: Not all farmers consistently 
maintain their Farmer Field Books - so have to sit and 
write diaries with themEnhancing Female Participation: Plan and conduct more 
separate meetings for women farmers to increase their 
participation, especially considering the constraints they face 
such as domestic responsibilities and long distances.
Use of T echnology: Integrate more audiovisual tools in 
training sessions to enhance understanding and retention 
among farmers.Sustained Engagement Needed: Continued follow-up and 
engagement are crucial to prevent farmers from reverting 
to less sustainable practices if the project ends.

availability.Significant reduction in pesticide use with a shift towards organic 
fertilizers.
Yield increase: Previously 7-8 quintals, now 10-11 quintals
Increased participation of female farmers due to targeted outreach 
through SHG meetings and home visits.
Effective implementation of PPE kitsRIR data collection is time-consuming, 
documentation of investment, expenditure, and 
profit for each farmer takes nearly 1h or more time.
Incorrect information provided by farmers due to 
lack of knowledge or skepticism/lack of trust of the 
FF at the initial stage.
Reluctance to share information directly for the fear 
of losing out on govt schemes, requiring additional 
time for explanation and persuasion.
Reliance on mobile phones for data entry, which is 
not always efficient.
Suggestion to reduce documentation work to allocate more 
time for fieldwork and training.
Customized tablets to improve data management.
Female Participation: 
Suggestions to link livelihood programs (tailoring, packing 
systems, embroidery, vegetable seeds packing) to increase 
female participation and empowerment.
Program Support:
Requests from farmers for additional support in providing 
PPE kits, which are currently unaffordable for many.Lack of irrigation facilities is a significant challenge 
mentioned by farmers, so the FF would like BC to 
facilitate them.
The FF expressed pride in their role and its impact on 
farmers' knowledge and income.
The current frequency of meetings with the PU Manager 
and Assistant PU Manager is deemed sufficient, with 
regular follow-ups and discussions.Sony_FF_Budidapally INTL01  - Interview

Sindhu (INTL 
01) - Sindhu is working as PUM from 2 years 
- Program objectives as per Sindhu: Increase soil organic carbon, 
reduce pesticide toxicity, increase incomes, women 
empowerment and regenerative agriculture 
- Based on this we prepare activities that are locally relevant and 
we implement it on field through FFs 
- 9 FFs (incl. APUM) and 43 villages under Sindhu, 3018 farmers 
- From 2012 WWF has been part of this project. 
- Governing structure (from bottom level) - Farmer, FF, PUM, 
Navkranti FPCL, Project coordinator (WWF), BCI
- Sindhu reports to project coordinator - Satish 
- Impact of work on BCI objectives: 
Initially the soil organic carbon - 0.32 now it is 0.38 
Women empowerment has increased 
Increase in adoption practices 
- Factors contributing to the success of the program: Our hard work &amp; 
FFs contribute to the success of the program 
- Highest impact:  Working on the field, field interactions and conducting 
trainings  
- Lowest impact:  Documentation is difficult. But data is important. 
- Aspects of work which are complex:  Doing the compilation is a task 
and laborious work. She has told BCI many times to reduce the 
documentation. (BCI in process of developing an app for direct data 
entry) 
- Time allocation of which of your responsibilities could be changed:  
Sindhu likes going on the field and conducting training - she said that 
farmers are also keen to learn and know more about tech (PB Knot, 
Cremigel, etc.) if we train them on this they are interested in its 
implementation. 
Role of Sindhu under various categories of work: 
HR:  Recruitment of FF (based on experience &amp; knowledge in 
farming, communication skills, motivation) 
After selecting she shares with Satish sir. 
Finance, Accounts : NA 
Project management: 
- Her day starts at 6:30 - 7 AM. FFs arrange for the farmers, then 
Sindhu goes and gives them training for an hour. If any farmer 
wants Sindhu to visit farm then she goes there too. 
- By 11:30-12 - home and lunch 
- By 1:30 - 2 - back to office (Huzurabad) - half an hour to one 
hour she talks to FF - understands their challenges, learnings, 
etc. 
- Then she does documentation work - Presently working on 
farmers list (updating last year list and entering farming data), 
well monitoring data (groundwater levels data), compiling of soil 
testing (this not everyday, from every 43 village 4 or 5 samples 
from each - cross checking of data) Minutes of training taken by 
FF - Sindhu cross checks that 
- Soil testing completed in may-june. Distributed soil health card 
to farmers and now compiling data ..
- Intercropping demo, stem application demo - to whom to give, 
etc. 
- Any work she finds complex - nothing as such, she is managing 
everything 
- Role of APUM - field visits with one FF, training, documentation 
verification &amp; monitoring - after coming to office we cross check 
with FF, etc. 
- Based on season, she decides which villages to go to - for eg. if 
any village has started with land prep then will prioritize that 
over another which has not yet.
Coordinator and facilitation of external assessment : NA Processes under MEL: 
- Cross checking: For each document there is a % which she cross 
checks. From each FF, 10 to 20% data is considered. So say if an FF 
has 4 villages under her - from each village 10% is considered and that 
sample is called and cross checked. 
- Each list / document is cross checked 10-20% (if the population is 
high) and 5 to 10% (if population is low) 
- This % was fixed internally by WWF. 
- APUM cross checks 40 to 50% 
- Project coordinator checks 3 to 5% 
- As per her, this process is reliable. If she finds any issues - she again 
tells the FF to cross check - so the process is very reliable. 
- Data is collected in google sheets, hard copies. Every document has a 
hardcopy - little difficult to manage but major data on google sheets. 
Management strategies: 
- We have a monitoring sheet with us when we go on field, she notes 
down in the sheet. 
- She also carries her diary and makes notes of suggestions, etc. We 
also come back and discuss with KVKs. 
- There is a whatsapp group of FFs + KVKs - so if FFs are unable to 
answer anything, they step in and answer. 
- Whatsapp group of only FFs + Sindhu 
- Whatsapp group with farmers 
- Village wise whatsapp group also 
- They put weather forecast info also 
- These groups also help farmers who have missed training to come to 
speed 
Factors that driver her:  Her parents were farmers, she is interested in 
this and has a degree as well in soil science. 
Number of lists:  Soil health (soil organic carbon, etc. is analyzed, we 
cross check if decreased or increased) &gt; Early season estimates 
(farmers list) &gt; well monitoring&gt; Demos are planned &gt; PRA data &gt; 
Activity / monitoring plan &gt; adoption plan &gt; FFBs &gt; RIR (post harvest 
estimates) 
What is the Farmers list approach? LGs, farmer codes for individual 
farmers, co farmers, irrigation data  etc.  (for responsibilities wrt each list 
see detailed transcript) 
How is the sample collected? 
- APUM - 40 to 50% of type of data, PUM - 10%, Satish sir - 3 to 5% 
- Demos are held based on seasons - for eg. sowing then spraying and 
Rallies (staff and villagers walking together with placards) are held in 
sept - august - for eg. not to use highly chemical pesticides, use PPE 
Kits, etc. - this way even Non - BC farmers get educated. 
Time spent on MEL work - Season wise lists are prepared - so her 
work also varies accordingly. Currently time for farmers list so her 1-2 
weeks goes in that. After that some other data set.- We train the FFs depending on season &gt;&gt; that they teach farmers 
- Communication material carried by FFs - flexes, pamphlets, door 
stickers. 
- We give special trainings also - to anganwadi workers, ASHA 
workers, healthcare workers, pesticide sprayers, school children - we 
tell them about Child Labour, to be away from hazardous chemicals, 
focus on education, etc.
- Every year 6 farmer trainings for each LG - she has 97 LGs 
- Each village 3-4 special activities / trainings 
- PUM role - Motivating farmers, if FFs cannot clarify anything then 
PUM comes in. 
- She is not sure if there is any efficient way to improve the MEL 
processes. She feels the current way is good. 
- Data is important - it helps understand if our training is working or 
not. 
Overall: Admin: 10%, Data: 60%, CS: 30%
Sindhu wants to spend more time with farmers and 
less on documentation. If BCI gives any alternative 
then she would be happy. She would like to replace 
her data admin work with field work. Data entry 
burden must be reduced - cross checking, 
duplication data, etc. no challenges faced in execution - Any given farmer - may be growing multiple 
crops on his 5-6 acres of land. In such cases we 
train on other crops also - if farmers have 
queries on other crops we answer. 
- In paddy farming, work is much less compared 
to cotton - once transplantation is done for 
paddy - farmers just go to farm daily switches on 
pump machines and that's it. But for cotton, 
everyday farmers have to go and some or other 
work is there. Water availability is high here so 
many are opting for paddy.

Nikita (INTL 
23) - She has been the PUM since one year 
Objectives as per Nikita: to identify cotton farmers and increase 
their yields, support farmers from sowing to harvesting, to 
empower women, increase soil organic carbon and decrease GHG 
emissions. 
- 50% chance that farmers will adapt to activities easily accessible 
to them. Accordingly we make activity plan and conduct demos, 
training, etc. all this is based on local context, so that it is easy for 
them to adopt to it. 
- Farmers feel a bit uncomfortable in PPE Kit - we make them 
aware of its importance and disadvantages of not wearing it 
- Annually six trainings have to be conducted every LG 
Highest impact:  Giving training &amp; demos to farmers is very crucial - it is 
very important for FFs to be knowledgeable. Every aspect of BCI should 
be known by FF only then he will be able to explain to farmers. 
Low impact:  Demos are only for few farmers (as impossible to give all 
farmers the inputs) - many farmers said that we come for training but you 
select only few. Nikita feels that if demos are done on a larger scale it will 
be more beneficial. 
Nikita said that the Demos have been crucial  - there are cross learnings 
since farmers tell other farmers the benefits they have gained. Because of 
this even other farmers become curious to practice the same. At times it is 
difficult for them to understand that pesticides are harmful because the 
yields initially drop. So farmers are worried about this - other than this 
they follow most of the things. 
Complex work: documentation work is complex - sometimes we are not 
able to concentrate on training because of excessive data work. HR: Preliminary screening of candidates - and then send to 
Sindhu or Satish 
Finance, Accounts:  NA 
Project Management: -  T o build activity plan according to which 
trainings are conducted as per pre determined timeline, 
Deadlines are fixed - cross checked, etc.
Coordinator and facilitation of external assessment: Self 
assessment, CB to FFs 
Others : Documentation work, Monthly twice review meetings, 
Daily field updates - we check FF phones if they have invited 
farmers and if few farmers have not attended why they have not 
attended. 
Systems &amp; processes: Yearly there is an activity plan - Nikita 
makes a to do plan every day and mentions deadlines for long 
term plans. In the internal FF review meetings (which is held 
twice monthly) she discusses a 15 day work plan with them. 
T ools used :  Diaries, for FFs she uses board and for data 
computer 
Factors that drive you to execute your duties:  Personal interest 
in animals and nature. After her masters in Zoology, she was 
interning with WWF under Biodiversity Restoration project. She 
believes that if the environment is friendly then only the animals 
will survive. That is why she propagates using organic fertilizers. 
She believes that BCI principles are very close to her ideologies.What data she handles? 
- Annually, we have to make a time bound plan, for which we have to 
know the key issues - collected by FF. This year we have an activity 
plan then a monitoring plan. 
- Soil sample testing - after that data compiled by FF, she puts it in the 
computer in prescribed BC format and then shares it to the project 
coordinator. 
- Action plan for FFs every month activities 
- Locally used pesticides list 
- Disadvantage list: we identify physically handicapped people and 
provide them livelihood -  we try to collaborate with govt. Schemes 
- Degraded lands identification - degraded lands identified and then 
restoration plan 
- FFB updation (routine) 
- Adoption 
- RIR 
How does she manage the data ? 
- Every data is seasonal and accordingly we share hard copies with FF 
- T ools used for handling data: Hardcopies, internal WWF excel 
templates which FF fill and give me, google sheets are also used. 
- FF collect data from farmers and then give to PUM &gt;&gt; PUM checks / 
calls or one to one contact with farmers and rectify any issue &gt;&gt; - 
APUM also checks the data &gt; PUM &gt; Project coordinator 
About farmers list 
- Annual updation 
- FF goes to the village and identifies cotton growing farmers and 
enrolls them. FF collects the data - if anyone is not growing cotton 
anymore then the same is mentioned. We filter him out and add new 
farmer. 
Types of data collected: See the detailed transcript 
Sample selection - randomly 
Steps taken to ensure quality and integrity of data collected: 
- She always cross checks. In the farmer list , we randomly select 10 
farmers and call them up to cross check info. If there is a mismatch, 
then Nikita goes to FF and tells them to cross check the entire data  
from her end. 
- 10% of sample size is chosen by me and if there is a mistake the full 
list is to be checked by FF. 
- APUM cross checks data and sometimes APUM also fills in data. 
- Note: PUM checks 10% from every village data - so FF may have 5 
villages under him or her - 10% of every 5 villages (50). APUM checks 
20 to 30% .. and project coordinator 3 to 5% - Trainings are conducted across 55 villages on the 6 BCI principles 
(55* 6). We also talk about RA practices (30 practices) - there is no 
separate training for this. In the same training we suggest farmers to 
do certain activities. 
- Trainings conducted till date: 12 *2 = 24 trainings 
- Frequency of the training: 1 FF will reach the same village twice a 
month. 
- At times, farmers are not interested in listening to me - most farmers 
are eager to get some input 
Overall: Admin: 5% (Since sindhu helps her in most 
admin work), Data: 60%, CS: 35%
BCI had told us documentation will reduce, even 
though it has reduced we have to maintain some 
docs to show proof of farmers adhering to program 
objectives. It will be better if we get more time on 
field than data entry work, and will be better in 
understanding issues faced by farmers. 
Do you think the MEL systems are efficient? 
10% is currently done, for the errors to lessen it 
would be better if we considered 20 to 30% . Due to 
heavy documentation work it becomes difficult. 
Challenges in execution / managing the PU position: 
- Deadlines are strict and sometimes we dont get data on time 
from farmers. For FF also it is difficult to collect data from 
farmers 
The above issue does not have effect on final project 
outcomes 
- Before BC project deadline, Satish sir has a deadline
Collection of data should be done in another way so that it 
is easier to fill in data. No issue in CS since Satish sir 
always there with us.Field notes_Nikita_PUM

Satish Botla. 
WWF PC - Satish is a consultant for WWF India , POC for BCI 
- Administrative + technical support for Karimnagar cluster, since 
2012 (for other clusters - Satish assists in technical work)
Responsibilities:  Divided in Admin &amp; T echnical 
Broad responsibilities: 
Data collection for project proposals 
Submission of Annual data to BCI 
CB of staff, planning for farmer training - Satish mainly 
responsible for staff trainings (TOT) 
planning , cross checking of documentations, training, action 
plans, corrective action plans, project review, analysis of results, - 
his broad responsibilities 
Under technical - 
Developing materials (like BCI principles recently changed - 
Satish translated in local language) includes material for training
(PUMs and FFs), 
plan for conducting trainings - PUM &amp; FFs, 
Also involved in BCI licensing assessments (whatever support 
required from WWF), 
CAP 
Under Admin 
Monitoring - Satish visits the fields at least 2 to 3 times a week. 
He talks to them, understands their issue, takes inputs from 
them, etc. During internal review he discusses this with PUM 
(once a month) PUMs also conduct stock taking meeting with 
FFs one in 15 days 
(for each and every document there is a detailed monitoring 
protocol. For eg. FFB - Field staff will monitor 10%, PUM 3%, 
APM 5%, Satish 3% at project level not unit level) 
Monitoring, reviewing, staff recruitment 
(every village (earlier it was LG) has one demo farmer for whom 
we give green grams, biofertilizers, etc. and other activities) 
Farmers list (annual): Giving training to PUM - how to fill, etc.  &amp; to Cross 
checking by Satish before sending to BCI
T ools used:  They internally have made easy excels (not prescribed by BCI) 
key points required by BCI are shared with them, rest retained with us. 
Attendance list: NA (only when he goes on field he sees it - this comes 
mainly under the purview of FF / PUM) 
Training &amp; CS activities: PUM and PU staff training,(farmer training - FFs 
/ PUM responsible) 
Adoption , RIR -  Same as CS activities
FFB -  No work but checks during field visits 
CS for farmers: Satish gives training to PUMs / Field staff, not 
directly to farmers. During CS activities, FF may not know the 
answer to every question farmers ask - they call Satish and ask 
him / whatsapp him.Admin: 20%, 
Data - 
Farmers list, Attendance, Training &amp; CS, Adoption, RIR, FFB :  25-30%
Trainings &amp; CS: 25-30%
Demos and Community level activities: 5-10% 
Max time in data and CS 
As per Satish, CB / CS and monitoring of fields of work are more 
helpful to farmers instead of data. 
Importance of Data : 
- Satish has discussed previously with BCI that such level of data 
collection is not required, data load is decreased alot now compared 
to 2012 -13 
- Reasons for doing FFB activity: BCI says for Farmer learning and RIR 
data 
- After many years of back &amp; forth: only 15% farmers in a PU are 
mandated to maintain FFB, rest voluntary. 
- No FFB was to be included in PURE - since farmers are interested in 
maintaining their own diary. Maintaining FFB also leads to increase 
in no. of training - how to fill, what units to fill, etc. 
- Satish said he would like to spend more time on training than being 
bogged down with data work 
- Satish had suggested that we (WWF) can make our own data 
templates to collect data - simple data - farmer name, village name, 
gender, mode of irrigation, contact - that's it. 
- Suggestion: Reduce data burden on FF / PUM. 
- Because of WWF - BC thought of implementing a project at global 
level (H&amp;M) 
- Similarly for PURE, they are piloting with us (India) - this shows the 
trust they have in WWF. 
- None of the INTLs have lost any licensing - this speaks for our work. - 
We speak directly with BCI 
Before data comes to Satish, it is checked 2 times 
(PUM and APUM) - so if they do a good job in 
checking my challenges are reduced automatically, 
but no other challenges as such. - The Appointment of MEL, CB manager has helped me put 
more time in other priority work where I am needed more. 
- More focus to be on capacity building. 
- Lot of docs in BCI, soft copies (1 TB finished) - Separate 
MEL manager will help us do effective analysis 
- Data including work burden of PUM instead of CS, in the 
self assessment report (every PU has this) for so many years, 
i have always given feedback that data needs to reduce 
inorder for PUMs to concentrate on field work 
Opinion on PUM / FF work allocation 
Depends from person to person 
75-80% of PUMs are doing well, 20-25% need to focus more 
on the project
About Licensing: 
- Rigorous audits done by BC for licensing of PU - 4 days of 
audit 
- They choose the sample - not WWF. 
- Management - checking of docs, what are the planned 
activities, activity wise success indicators, etc. 
- Interview with PUM - They talk to PUM - as per BCI 
PUM, a very important / effective POC. - - They feel, if 
PUM is effective then the farmers will reap the benefits. 
Even the project - coordinator is not allowed to speak 
much during these meetings with PUM. 
- Field level - they will select some LGs (BC informs only 
24 hours before about the sample to avoid any 
manipulation) -Farmer interviews are done- they ask BCI 
principles being followed are not - they check farmers 
knowledge and then the adoption - two main factors. 
- Other stakeholders - Workers - BC also interacts with 
field workers
- Verifiers will cross check with fertilizer shops and cross 
check if they are selling organic fertilizers mentioned by 
farmers in the vicinity,
- They also check with schools asking them if there is any 
child labor, etc. 
- Closing day - major findings are discussed 
- They prepare a report and submit it to BC India and they 
decide if the license will be continued or not. Types of 
licenses - Compliance with observation (means farmers 
may have knowledge but adoption is less - so they will give 
chance to see if there is any growth happening) 
- 64 Indicators under BCI - non-compliance with any one 
of the indicators - license is lost. 
- Licensing done once in three years. INTL 23 is pending 
for licensing this year. INTL 01 and 02 got licenses in the 
last 2 years.
About ginners 
- Supply chain very big challenge in BCI 
- BC program farmers do not necessarily go to 
BC licensed Ginner 
- BC program farmers wanted more money per 
quintal - premium 
- Ultimate benefit of this project is to the 
environment 
- Biggest cotton market - Jammikunta - Rs. 100-
150 price higher compared to other markets. 
Reason: There are a lot of ginning mills in 
Jammikunta, so prices are competitive. 
- There is a BCI portal for registered ginners and 
spinners. 
- Ginners are not getting a lot of benefit and 
hence are not keen on continuing with the 
license.

FF1 - Vanitha (INTL 23)	Vanita has been a Field Facilitator for four months and she has 7 to 8 villages under her. Every village has close to 40 to 50 farmers. Vanita is passionate about training farmers and sharing her knowledge with them. If given the choice, she would prefer to dedicate more of her time to trainings over data entry work.	Vanita's responsibilities are varied and require meticulous attention to detail. She is in charge of gathering essential data for the Farmers List, which includes details like the farmer's name, acres of land, irrigation methods, and contact numbers. After collecting this information, she diligently cross-checks it with the farmers to ensure accuracy. 

For attendance, Vanita maintains the LG book, a hardcopy record where farmers sign after each meeting, ensuring that participation is documented. When it comes to training and capacity-strengthening activities, Vanita is at the forefront, leading farmer training sessions and demonstrating sustainable agricultural practices. She conducts demos on intercropping and the use of biofertilizers, motivating farmers to adopt these environmentally friendly methods.

In her role, Vanita also oversees the accuracy of the data recorded in the Farm Field Books (FFB). She cross-checks this information, particularly focusing on instances where farmers might inflate costs. Her ability to verify this data is crucial, as it relies on comparisons with records from other farmers. Additionally, she assists farmers in filling out their FFBs, ensuring all information is correct. Once completed, she signs the books and takes photos for official records, maintaining a comprehensive and accurate account of the work being done. 

Overall, she spends 30% of her time on admin work, 40% of her time on data work and remaining 30% on CS activities. 	Vanita's day begins early at 7:30 AM, starting with a visit to the field to engage with farmers. After spending the morning in the field, she heads to the office after lunch to enter data from her morning sessions. Although she handles much of this work on her own, she occasionally receives assistance from the APU and PU managers, especially during busier times.

The timing of her training sessions is often discussed and finalized through WhatsApp groups, ensuring that both she and the farmers are on the same page. Her daily routine is a mix of calling farmers to arrange training, conducting these sessions, and managing data and administrative tasks. Vanita also dedicates time specifically to training female farmers.

During her training sessions, Vanita makes effective use of Flex banners, which she believes are invaluable in helping farmers grasp complex concepts more easily. The visual aids, featuring pictures, make it simpler for farmers to understand topics such as water management, biodiversity, soil health management, and cotton storage. Each session typically sees the participation of 20 to 30 farmers.

For those farmers who miss the training, Vanita takes the extra step of meeting them in the field to ensure they are up to speed on the topics covered. After each meeting, she ensures that all attendees sign the LG book as a record of their participation. To keep track of everything discussed, Vanita diligently maintains a diary where she notes down key points from each training.

Vanita also conducts soil testing as part of her role. After receiving the results, she meets with the farmers to discuss the findings and provide advice where necessary. Over the course of a month, she typically conducts three to four meetings. Beyond these regular activities, Vanita has also been involved in organizing two rallies focused on the use of PPE kits and addressing child labor, reflecting her commitment to broader social issues affecting the farming community.	Vanita's day is a balancing act between administrative duties and her passion for working directly with farmers. She spends about half an hour each day on admin work, followed by 2 to 3 hours of office data work. During the busy season, this data entry becomes a daily task, consuming 2 to 3 hours each day, while in the off-season, it drops to 1 to 2 hours. On a monthly basis, this adds up to a significant portion of her time—anywhere from 50% to 70%—being devoted to administrative tasks.

Every day, Vanita spends 10 to 15 minutes maintaining the Farmers List and another 10 to 15 minutes updating the Attendance List.  Additionally, she dedicates half an hour to an hour daily to adoption activities, an hour to RIR tasks, and another half hour to assisting farmers with their Farm Field Books (FFB).

Training and capacity strengthening, which are central to her role, also occupy 3 hours of her day, with a demo conducted once a week that lasts for about 2 hours. When broken down, Vanita's overall time allocation is roughly 30% for administrative tasks, 40% for data work, and 20% to 30% for capacity strengthening and training activities.

Despite her efficiency, Vanita finds the excessive data work physically taxing, causing shoulder and eye pain. More importantly, she feels that this time could be better spent on training and interacting with farmers, which she finds far more rewarding. If given the option, she would gladly reduce her data entry work to focus more on these impactful activities.	Vanita's motivation for becoming a FF stems from her deep-rooted experience working with farmers and her background in the children's rights domain. She has always had a passion for farming, and she firmly believes that women farmers often bring more innovative ideas to the table than their male counterparts. This belief is reinforced by her work with BC, which actively encourages farmers to share their insights and keeps them motivated.

For Vanita, the most impactful aspects of her work are the training sessions, phone follow-ups, and one-on-one interactions with both farmers and field workers. These activities allow her to make a direct and meaningful difference in the lives of those she works with.

Vanita also recognizes the critical role that data plays in her work. She views data as a storyteller, providing valuable insights that guide the training sessions and other activities she conducts. This understanding underscores her commitment to using data effectively to maximize the benefits for the farmers she supports.	The biggest challenge faced by Vanita is incorrect data and delays in data sharing, coupled with the need for repeated follow-ups, making the process time-consuming.	Vanita firmly believes that organic farming results in higher-quality cotton, a conviction that drives her dedication to promoting sustainable practices among farmers. She recognizes that her work would be even more beneficial if she could spend more time in the field, directly engaging with farmers, and if meetings were scheduled according to the farmers' availability, preferably in the afternoons rather than the mornings.

Vanita also sees potential for improving the efficiency of administrative tasks, which often take up a significant portion of her time. She is eager to enhance her own knowledge so that she can offer even more valuable information to the farmers, further supporting their efforts in achieving better results.	When asked about her overall experience, she said she has gathered more information to communicate with farmers in BCI, performed soil testing, and visited farmers' gatherings in village GPs. 

Vanita believes that women farmers have more ideas than men and she actively encourages them to share ideas during training sessions.

FF2 - Rakesh (INTL 02)	Rakesh, who has been a FF for two years, oversees six villages and is responsible for 445 farmers. In managing his duties, Rakesh relies heavily on his mobile phone for nearly every task. From taking photos in the field to sharing updates with the PUM daily, his phone has become an indispensable tool. However, the constant data handling often causes his device to freeze, making his work more challenging. Rakesh mentioned that it would be much more efficient if BC could provide them with tablets, which would better support the demanding nature of his job.	Rakesh manages attendance data by recording the minutes of every meeting and training session. He ensures that each farmer signs the LG attendance book after every meeting, maintaining a thorough record of participation.

When it comes toFFB, Rakesh provides crucial support to illiterate farmers, helping them accurately complete their entries. He notes that while literate farmers can generally fill out the data correctly on their own, the illiterate ones often make errors. To address this, Rakesh advises them to bring their FFBs to meetings where he assists them in making the necessary corrections.

For adoption data, Rakesh uses a printed table to track the farming practices followed by each farmer. He marks the relevant practices for each individual, and this data is then sent to the PUM for further verification and entry into the computer system.

Regarding the RIR data, Rakesh's involvement is minimal. His role is confined to transferring data from the FFB to an Excel spreadsheet, which is an internal document created by WWF and is less complex than the RIR.	Rakesh’s daily routine involves meeting with at least two LGs, each session focused on a specific training topic relevant to the season. Each meeting lasts about an hour,. Every 15 days, Rakesh organizes training on a specific topic across all the villages under his care, collaborating with the PUMs to determine the subjects to cover. While Rakesh handles these meetings on his own, the PUMs occasionally join for sessions on specific issues like child labor or women-focused meetings, typically once a month. The APUM checks in every 15 days to confirm that these meetings are taking place.

The training sessions cover a range of general topics, including soil health, biodiversity, land fertility improvement, and water pollution reduction. To support regenerative agriculture, Rakesh provides green gram and red gram seeds to demo farmers, which helps reduce their investment costs and builds their trust in the program. This trust is reinforced by sharing valuable information on combination medicines, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, which encourages regular participation in the meetings.

For farmers who miss these sessions, Rakesh takes a proactive approach by conducting home visits, making follow-up phone calls, and providing comprehensive summaries of the missed topics to encourage their attendance at future meetings. Additionally, he occasionally attends Self-Help Group (SHG) meetings, where he educates women on various topics such as kitchen gardening, tailoring, and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits.

After the cotton is harvested, Rakesh offers practical advice on storage, recommending methods to keep the cotton away from water and suggesting open storage as a better option to preserve quality.	Rakesh begins his day at 6:30 AM, with farmers having already been informed about the day's meeting the previous evening. He starts with an hour of training, followed by 30 minutes of field visits and observations. His office work consumes about three hours of his day. During May and December, he spends additional time monitoring wells across three villages. 

In terms of time distribution, Rakesh dedicates 20% of his time to administrative tasks, 30% to data management, and 50% to capacity strengthening activities. He finds transferring well monitoring data from the field to Google Sheets to be a time-consuming task that he considers unnecessary. He believes that the time spent on this task could be better utilized training farmers who grow crops other than cotton, such as maize and paddy.

Updating the farmers' list is another significant task. Rakesh estimates it takes him 15 to 20 minutes to collect information from each farmer, with the entire process for one village taking 2 to 3 days and for all villages under his purview, 10 to 15 days annually, as the list is updated every year.

Rakesh has expressed a desire to reduce the amount of time spent on data documentation. He noted that inaccurate or incomplete data entries in the FFB often impact the accuracy of the RIR. He helps illiterate farmers with data entry while literate farmers handle it correctly on their own. Rakesh is keenly interested in training and believes that while data is crucial for monitoring and supporting farmers, he would prefer to spend more of his time on direct training activities.	Previously, farmers were spending around Rs. 18,000 per acre on cultivation. However, after joining BC program  this expenditure has been reduced to below Rs. 15,000. Before joining the program, farmers relied heavily on DAP based on their own knowledge, but this approach did not yield the expected results.

When asked about the impact of his work, at an FF level, he said that he has conducted over 50 training sessions for farmers, also engaging with various stakeholders such as workers, schools, and ANMs. Reflecting on his efforts, Rakesh estimates that he has achieved about 70% of the impact he aims for, acknowledging that there remains room for further improvement. He highlights that the most significant outcomes of his work have come from educating farmers on the use of bio-pesticides, cow urine, and cow dung, which have proven highly effective in enhancing their agricultural practices. Rakesh feels immense pride that he has been able to reduce fertilizer usage which has led to increase by 10 to 12 quintals per acre of farmers. 

Motivation of Rakesh: 
- “I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” 

When asked what he feels has been the impact of his work - &quot;I never recommend using pesticides; instead, I advocate for organic fertilizers like neem oil and homemade preparations. We use Agni Asram, neem, and Jeevamrutham, all of which are prepared on agricultural land. The soil quality has remained stable. We’ve organized rallies in villages to discourage the use of red-colored pesticides. During meetings, we conducted an intercropping demonstration using green grams, which not only increased soil carbon but also provided farmers with an additional income. We are also developing vermicompost.&quot;	Rakesh strongly suggested to have meetings at night (6:30 to 8:30 PM) - since farmers are free at that time 
	Rakesh has highlighted several key improvements since the project began. The initiative now includes providing vegetable seeds and connecting farmers with tailoring units. Additionally, they are supplying more seeds for kitchen gardens, which supports both food security and local livelihoods.

Their Sustainable Land Management efforts have also made a significant impact. In collaboration with WWF, they have distributed plants to farmers and introduced border crops like coconut trees. These border crops not only protect farm boundaries but also help retain soil moisture, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.

As per Rakesh, there is a clear difference between BCI &amp; non-BCI cotton - quality, color and fibre, etc.  

Rakesh feels that the cultivation of Better Cotton is on the rise. He particularly appreciates the use of bio-pesticides and the preparation of neem oil by farmers. - A mixture of 5 kg cow dung, 5 liters of cow urine, 5 kg of jaggery, and soil is also used, and he finds this method effective. 

Farmers are also preparing and using Trichoderma, which he highly values. Stem application is another method he favors; out of 30 farmers, 20 are using it. - This technique effectively eradicates sucking insects. What he loves most about stem application is that it prevents soil and environmental pollution, unlike spraying, which can cause harm. By applying directly to the plant stem, we ensure no damage to the soil or the environment.

(about stem application usage: Sixty percent of farmers are using stem application. Just 250 ml is sufficient for two acres. While spraying costs around Rs. 1,000, stem application costs only Rs. 200. It also saves time, taking just one hour compared to two for spraying. Overall, the investment is significantly lower. This method has been implemented since two years)

FF 3 - Ramesh (INTL23)	As a Field Facilitator, Ramesh is responsible for the Monthly Planning and Execution of his field-related duties. He meticulously prepares and implements the Monthly Action Plan, which includes planning village visits, scheduling meetings, and conducting awareness programs that are tailored to the seasonal needs of the community. His proactive approach ensures that all activities are aligned with the program’s objectives and effectively address the community's requirements.
In the area of Coordination and Communication, Ramesh maintains consistent contact with farmers through calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. He collaborates with Lead Farmers, community heads, and other stakeholders to both gather and disseminate essential information. His effective communication ensures that everyone involved is informed and engaged in the program's activities.

When it comes to Reporting, Ramesh diligently updates the Field Manager and PU Manager on the progress of the action plan. He provides detailed reports on any deviations from the plan, ensuring transparency and alignment with the overall program objectives. His thorough reporting is crucial for maintaining the integrity and success of the program.

For Documentation, Ramesh is responsible for maintaining and verifying Farmer Field Books (FFBs), recording entries in diaries, and submitting meeting minutes along with signatures to the Field Manager. His meticulous attention to detail in documentation ensures accurate records are kept, contributing to the program’s accountability and success.	Ramesh diligently gathers data from Lead Farmers, ensuring that the farmer lists are accurate by conducting physical visits and making phone calls. This meticulous process of cross-checking information allows him to update records with precision, ensuring that the data is reliable and up-to-date. His thorough approach to data validation plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the program's database.

In his role, Ramesh is also responsible for Monitoring Farmer Practices. He keeps a close watch on how farmers adhere to the guidelines provided, particularly in the use of organic fertilizers and pesticides. By regularly following up with the farmers, Ramesh ensures that they continue to comply with sustainable agricultural practices. This ongoing monitoring is vital for promoting environmentally friendly farming methods and ensuring that the program's objectives are being met.

Ramesh also takes on the responsibility of Result Indicator Reporting (RIR), where he tracks and reports on key performance indicators related to farmer practices and crop outcomes. His reports offer valuable	Ramesh plays a pivotal role in conducting Training and Awareness Programs for farmers. He organizes and leads training sessions and awareness meetings on essential topics such as crop management, pesticide use, and environmental protection. To enhance the farmers' understanding, he utilizes Farmer Field Books (FFBs) as a tool to educate them on the importance of proper record-keeping. Through these programs, Ramesh ensures that farmers are well-informed and equipped with the knowledge they need to implement best practices in their fields.

In addition to training, Ramesh is responsible for Material Distribution and Demonstrations. He distributes educational materials, such as flexes, and conducts practical demonstrations on techniques like using sticky traps for pest control. To further reinforce the training, he shares informative videos through WhatsApp groups, making the information easily accessible to the farmers. These efforts help solidify the knowledge imparted during training sessions and encourage the adoption of these practices.

Ramesh is also deeply committed to Promoting Sustainable Practices among the farming community. He actively encourages farmers to adopt sustainable farming methods, such as the use of Navadhanyalu (nine types of seeds), which supports biodiversity and soil health. Additionally, he advocates for the reduction of chemical pesticides, promoting more environmentally friendly alternatives. Through these initiatives, Ramesh contributes to the long-term sustainability of agriculture in the region.	Ramesh conducts Training Sessions that typically last between 30 to 40 minutes each. These sessions are designed to be concise yet informative, providing farmers with the essential knowledge they need in a focused timeframe.

His Field Visits are scheduled daily, starting early in the morning at 7:00 AM and continuing until 5:30 PM. During these visits, Ramesh engages in meetings and fieldwork, ensuring that he is present in the community to offer guidance and support throughout the day.

In the Post-Noon hours, Ramesh primarily focuses on office-related tasks. This time is dedicated to administrative duties, including updating records, preparing reports, and coordinating with other team members to ensure that all aspects of his work are well-organized and aligned with the program's goals.	The program that Ramesh facilitates brings significant Environmental Benefits to the community. One of the key outcomes is the reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, which leads to a healthier environment and safer agricultural practices. Additionally, there is an increased use of organic fertilizers, which further enhances soil health and sustainability. These efforts collectively contribute to improved environmental protection, ensuring a more sustainable future for the region.

For the Farmers, the benefits are equally substantial. By adopting the recommended practices, farmers experience an increase in their crop yields, which directly translates to higher profits. This financial boost allows them to reduce their overall investment in farming inputs, creating a more cost-effective approach to agriculture. Moreover, the higher profits enable farmers to invest in the education of their children, improving opportunities for the next generation.

The program also sees a strong Adoption of Practices among the farming community, with an impressive 80% of farmers following the recommended guidelines. This high adoption rate underscores the effectiveness of the program and the positive impact it has on both the farmers and the environment.	Data Management poses a significant challenge for Ramesh, as ensuring accurate data collection and validation is often a time-consuming process. The meticulous effort required to gather and cross-check data demands considerable attention to detail, which can be demanding given the scope of his responsibilities.

Farmer Engagement also presents its own set of challenges. Not all farmers consistently maintain their Farmer Field Books, which can hinder the documentation process. As a result, Ramesh often has to spend additional time sitting with the farmers to help them write and update their diaries. This hands-on approach is necessary to ensure that records are properly maintained, but it adds an extra layer of effort to his already busy schedule.






	Ramesh suggests Enhancing Female Participation by planning and conducting more separate meetings for women farmers. This approach aims to address the unique constraints they face, such as domestic responsibilities and long distances, thereby increasing their participation in the program.

Additionally, he recommends Using Technology to improve training sessions. By integrating more audiovisual tools, such as videos and interactive presentations, Ramesh believes that farmers will gain a better understanding and retention of the material covered. This method is intended to make the training more engaging and effective.	Field Facilitator  - Ramesh
FF 4 - Sony (INTL01)	Sony has been working with BC as an FF for the past 1 year. She has previously worked with Self Help Groups for a few years before becoming a full time employee at BC.
Sony has been working as a field facilitator for the past year and visits six villages under her once a week.

Her main responsibilities are:
Coordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information.
Reporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives.	Sony is responsible for collecting and verifying data through Farmer Field Books (FFB), field visits, and phone calls. She conducts Result Indicator Recording (RIR) data collection, analyzing investment, expenditure, and profit related to agricultural activities. Ensuring accurate documentation is a key part of her role, along with cross-checking farmer information to maintain data integrity. 

Sony provides support through home visits to women who miss training sessions, ensuring they receive the necessary guidance. She also follows up with farmers who need additional assistance. Her engagement with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) is crucial, as she actively works to increase female participation in the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) program, promoting gender inclusivity in agricultural practices.



	Sony provides training on organic farming practices, pesticide reduction, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). She engages with Self-Help Groups (SHGs), conducts awareness sessions, and facilitates stakeholder meetings. 
Additionally, she organizes field visits, demonstrations, and rallies to promote sustainable agriculture. Sony visits six villages weekly, carefully scheduling meetings based on farmer convenience to ensure maximum participation and impact.


	Sony's daily schedule consists of field visits from 7 AM to 12:30 PM, followed by office work, including documentation, from 2 PM to 5 PM. 
The specific tasks she handles include data collection for the farmer list, which spans one month (April and May). RIR data collection per farmer typically takes 40 to 60 minutes, while training sessions last between 45 minutes to 1 hour. Demonstrations usually take about 20 minutes, and the duration of home visits and follow-up meetings varies depending on the farmer's availability.

	Sony has facilitated a significant reduction in pesticide use, with farmers increasingly adopting organic fertilizers. This shift has resulted in an increase in crop yields, from the previous 7-8 quintals to 10-11 quintals. Through targeted outreach via SHG meetings and home visits, Sony has successfully increased female farmer participation. Additionally, she has ensured the effective implementation of PPE kits among the farming community.





	Sony encounters several challenges in her role as a Field Facilitator. The RIR data collection process is particularly time-consuming, often requiring an hour or more to document investment, expenditure, and profit for each farmer. She frequently deals with incorrect information provided by farmers, who may lack knowledge or initially be skeptical and mistrustful of her role. Some farmers are reluctant to share information directly, fearing they might lose access to government schemes, which necessitates Sony spending extra time on explanation and persuasion. However, she noted that after working with the farmers for a year, a level of trust has been established. The farmers are no longer as skeptical as they were initially, and they are now more willing to provide accurate information.
Furthermore, her reliance on mobile phones for data entry proves to be an inefficient method at times as the device may happen to hang. She instead recommended the provision of special tablets for data collection	Sony suggested reducing documentation work to allocate more time for fieldwork and training. She recommended the use of customized tablets to improve data management efficiency. 

To enhance female participation, she proposed linking livelihood programs such as tailoring, packing systems, embroidery, and vegetable seeds packing. These initiatives aim to boost female participation, empowerment, and financial independence within the community. Additionally, she highlighted the need for more support in providing PPE kits, which many farmers currently find unaffordable.






	Sony pointed out that the lack of irrigation facilities is a significant challenge mentioned by farmers, and she expressed a desire for Better Cotton to facilitate improvements in this area. She takes pride in her role, noting its positive impact on farmers' knowledge and income. 

Additionally, she believes that the current frequency of meetings with the PU Manager and Assistant PU Manager is sufficient, as they include regular follow-ups and discussions to address ongoing issues.

Sindhu (INTL 01) 	Sindhu has been serving as a PUM for the past two years, overseeing a broad and impactful program. Her core objectives are to boost soil organic carbon, cut down pesticide toxicity, enhance farmer incomes, empower women, and advance regenerative agriculture. To achieve these goals, Sindhu and her team develop and implement field activities tailored to local needs.

She manages a team of 9 FFs, including an Assistant PUM, across 43 villages, reaching out to a total of 3,018 farmers. Since 2012, WWF has been a key partner in this project. The program operates within a structured hierarchy, starting with the farmers at the grassroots level, followed by Field Facilitators, PUMs, Navkranti FPCL, Project Coordinator (WWF), and finally BCI. Sindhu reports directly to Satish, the Project Coordinator, ensuring that the project's objectives are met and its impact is maximized.	The impact of Sindhu’s work on the BCI objectives has been significant. The soil organic carbon levels have risen from 0.32 to 0.38, reflecting improved soil health. Additionally, there has been a notable increase in women's empowerment and the adoption of sustainable practices among farmers.

The success of the program is largely attributed to the dedication and efforts of Sindhu and her Field Facilitators. The highest impact comes from direct fieldwork, hands-on interactions with farmers, and the training sessions they conduct. However, documentation remains a challenging aspect, often seen as laborious despite its importance. Sindhu has frequently advocated for reducing the documentation burden, and BCI is currently developing an app to streamline data entry.

Sindhu finds fieldwork and training to be the most fulfilling parts of her job, and she believes farmers are eager to learn and implement new technologies. For instance, training on innovations like PB Knot and Cremigel has sparked interest among farmers, demonstrating their willingness to embrace new practices. If given the opportunity, Sindhu would prefer to allocate more time to these impactful field activities rather than the demanding task of documentation.	Sindhu’s role encompasses a range of responsibilities across different categories:

HR:Sindhu is involved in recruiting FFs, focusing on their experience in farming, communication skills, and motivation. After selecting candidates, she presents her recommendations to Satish sir.

Project Management: Sindhu’s day begins early, around 6:30 or 7 AM. She starts by conducting training sessions for farmers, typically lasting an hour. If a farmer requests a farm visit, Sindhu accommodates that as well. By mid-morning, she returns home for lunch, and by early afternoon, she heads back to the office in Huzurabad.

In the office, Sindhu spends 30 minutes to an hour discussing with FFs, understanding their challenges, and learning from their experiences. She then focuses on documentation tasks, which include updating the farmers' list, entering farming data, monitoring groundwater levels, and compiling soil testing results. The soil testing process, which involves collecting samples from each of the 43 villages, is done primarily during May and June. Sindhu also ensures that the minutes of training sessions taken by FFs are accurately cross-checked.

Sindhu manages intercropping and stem application demos, deciding on the allocation of these resources. Although she finds her work challenging at times, she feels capable of handling it effectively. The APUM assists with field visits, training, documentation verification, and monitoring, and Sindhu cross-checks this information once back in the office. She adjusts her village visits based on seasonal priorities, such as focusing on villages that have started land preparation.

Sindhu does not handle finance or external assessments directly.	Training for FFs is tailored to the seasons, ensuring that they are well-prepared to teach farmers effectively. The FFs are equipped with various communication materials, including flexes, pamphlets, and door stickers, to aid in their training sessions.

In addition to farmer training, special sessions are held for a wider audience, including anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare professionals, pesticide sprayers, and school children. These trainings focus on important issues such as child labor, the dangers of hazardous chemicals, and the importance of education.

Each year, Sindhu organizes six training sessions for each of her 97 LGs, and every village receives 3 to 4 special activities or trainings. As a PUM, Sindhu plays a crucial role in motivating farmers and stepping in when FFs need clarification or additional support.

Sindhu remains uncertain about whether there is a more efficient way to enhance the MEL processes, but she believes the current system is effective. She emphasizes the importance of data in assessing the impact of their training programs and ensuring they are achieving their intended outcomes.	Sindhu's current time allocation reveals that 10% of her work is dedicated to administrative tasks, 60% to data management, and 30% to capacity strengthening (CS) activities. 

She is keen to shift her focus more towards fieldwork and interactions with farmers, expressing a desire to reduce the time spent on documentation and data entry. Sindhu believes that the burden of data-related tasks, including cross-checking and managing duplicate information, could be alleviated with alternative solutions provided by BCI. This change would allow her to spend more time directly benefiting farmers and enhancing the program’s impact.	Field notes_Sindhu_PUM
Nikita (INTL 23) 	Nikita has been serving as a PUM for the past year. As per her the objective of the BC program are to identify cotton farmers, boost their yields, and support them throughout the growing cycle from sowing to harvesting, with an additional focus on empowering women, enhancing soil organic carbon, and reducing GHG emissions. Nikita’s approach is based on the principle that farmers are more likely to adapt to activities that are easily accessible to them, so she creates activity plans and conducts demonstrations and trainings tailored to the local context. Although farmers initially feel uncomfortable wearing PPE kits, Nikita educates them on their importance and the risks associated with not using them. Each LG is tasked with conducting six trainings annually.	The highest impact of Nikita's role comes from providing training and demonstrations to farmers. She believes that for FFs to effectively teach farmers, they must be well-versed in every aspect of the BCI program. When FFs have a deep understanding, they can better explain the program's benefits and practices to the farmers.

On the other hand, Nikita finds that the impact of demonstrations is somewhat limited because they reach only a few farmers at a time. Many farmers have expressed frustration that they are often left out of these demos, leading to a perception of favoritism. Nikita feels that scaling up the demonstrations could make them more effective and beneficial to a larger number of farmers.

Despite the challenges, Nikita notes that demos have been instrumental in fostering cross-learning. Farmers who participate share their experiences and benefits with others, sparking curiosity and encouraging broader adoption of practices. However, there are challenges in convincing farmers about the long-term benefits of reduced pesticide use, especially when initial yields drop, leading to concerns and hesitation.

Documentation work presents a significant challenge for Nikita, often detracting from her ability to focus on training. The complexity and volume of data management sometimes make it difficult for her to dedicate sufficient time to hands-on activities with farmers.	Sindhu’s role encompasses a range of responsibilities across different categories:

In terms of HR, Nikita conducts preliminary screenings of candidates before forwarding them to Sindhu or Satish. Although she doesn't handle finance or accounts, she plays a key role in project management by developing activity plans, ensuring deadlines are met, and coordinating self-assessment and external evaluations for FFs. She manages documentation, reviews progress bi-monthly, and monitors daily field updates.

Nikita employs a structured approach to systems and processes. She prepares a yearly activity plan, maintains daily to-do lists, and sets deadlines for long-term goals. She holds internal FF review meetings twice a month to discuss a 15-day work plan. For tools, she uses diaries, boards for FFs, and computers for data management.

Her personal passion for animals and nature, rooted in her master’s in Zoology and her work with WWF on a Biodiversity Restoration project, has driven her commitment to organic practices and environmental sustainability. She believes that aligning with BCI principles helps create a favorable environment for both farmers and wildlife.	Nikita manages the training process across 55 villages, focusing on the six BCI principles, with a total of 330 training sessions (55 villages x 6 principles). In addition to these, she integrates discussions on 30 regenerative agriculture (RA) practices into the same training sessions, advising farmers on various activities within the same framework. To date, she has conducted 24 trainings (12 sessions x 2).

Each FF visits the same village twice a month, ensuring regular interaction with farmers. Despite occasional resistance from some farmers towards Nikita, most are enthusiastic about receiving input and guidance.

	Regarding her workload, Nikita allocates her time as follows: 5% on administrative tasks (with Sindhu assisting significantly in this area), 60% on data management, and 35% on capacity strengthening (CS). While BCI had promised a reduction in documentation requirements, there is still a need to maintain certain records to demonstrate adherence to program objectives. Nikita believes that spending more time in the field, rather than on data entry, would be more beneficial for understanding and addressing the challenges faced by farmers.	Field notes_Nikita_PUM

Responsibilities: Divided in Admin &amp; Technical 
Broad responsibilities: 
Data collection for project proposals 
Submission of Annual data to BCI 
CB of staff, planning for farmer training - Satish mainly responsible for staff trainings (TOT) 
planning , cross checking of documentations, training, action plans, corrective action plans, project review, analysis of results, - his broad responsibilities 
Under technical -
Developing materials (like BCI principles recently changed - Satish translated in local language) includes material for training(PUMs and FFs), 
plan for conducting trainings - PUM &amp; FFs, 
Also involved in BCI licensing assessments (whatever support required from WWF), 
CAP 
Under Admin 
Monitoring - Satish visits the fields at least 2 to 3 times a week. He talks to them, understands their issue, takes inputs from them, etc. During internal review he discusses this with PUM (once a month) PUMs also conduct stock taking meeting with FFs one in 15 days 
(for each and every document there is a detailed monitoring protocol. For eg. FFB - Field staff will monitor 10%, PUM 3%, APM 5%, Satish 3% at project level not unit level) 
Monitoring, reviewing, staff recruitment 
(every village (earlier it was LG) has one demo farmer for whom we give green grams, biofertilizers, etc. and other activities) 
	Farmers list (annual): Giving training to PUM - how to fill, etc.  &amp; to Cross checking by Satish before sending to BCI
Tools used: They internally have made easy excels (not prescribed by BCI) key points required by BCI are shared with them, rest retained with us. 
Attendance list: NA (only when he goes on field he sees it - this comes mainly under the purview of FF / PUM) 
Training &amp; CS activities: PUM and PU staff training,(farmer training - FFs / PUM responsible) 
Adoption , RIR - Same as CS activities
FFB - No work but checks during field visits 

	CS for farmers: Satish gives training to PUMs / Field staff, not directly to farmers. During CS activities, FF may not know the answer to every question farmers ask - they call Satish and ask him / whatsapp him.	Admin: 20%, 
Data - 
Farmers list, Attendance, Training &amp; CS, Adoption, RIR, FFB : 25-30%
Trainings &amp; CS: 25-30%
Demos and Community level activities: 5-10% 

Max time in data and CS 

As per Satish, CB / CS and monitoring of fields of work are more helpful to farmers instead of data. 

Importance of Data : 
- Satish has discussed previously with BCI that such level of data collection is not required, data load is decreased alot now compared to 2012 -13 
- Reasons for doing FFB activity: BCI says for Farmer learning and RIR data 
- After many years of back &amp; forth: only 15% farmers in a PU are mandated to maintain FFB, rest voluntary. 
- No FFB was to be included in PURE - since farmers are interested in maintaining their own diary. Maintaining FFB also leads to increase in no. of training - how to fill, what units to fill, etc. 
- Satish said he would like to spend more time on training than being bogged down with data work 
- Satish had suggested that we (WWF) can make our own data templates to collect data - simple data - farmer name, village name, gender, mode of irrigation, contact - that's it. 
- Suggestion: Reduce data burden on FF / PUM. 
	- Because of WWF - BC thought of implementing a project at global level (H&amp;M) 
- Similarly for PURE, they are piloting with us (India) - this shows the trust they have in WWF. 
- None of the INTLs have lost any licensing - this speaks for our work. - We speak directly with BCI 
	Before data comes to Satish, it is checked 2 times (PUM and APUM) - so if they do a good job in checking my challenges are reduced automatically, but no other challenges as such. 	Field notes_Satish_PC WWF

- Given an option she would reduce her data entry work
	- Motivation for being FF - Vanita used to previously deal with farmers and also work in the children's rights domain. She enjoys farming and believes that women farmers have more ideas than men. She said that BC encourages farmers to share their ideas and keep them inspired. Additionally, she believes that the highest profits are reaped from farming the organic way. 
- Highest impact work: Training, phone follows ups, one to one interactions with farmers and field workers.
- Vanitha believes that data is very important as it tells us a story and based on that they conduct the trainings.

	Incorrect data and delays in data sharing involving repeated follow up which becomes time consuming. 	- As per Vanita, doing organic farming yields higher quality cotton 
- As per Vanita, her responsibilities which will benefit the farmers more is - an increase in her field time and scheduling meetings as per farmers availability (in the afternoon instead of morning) 
- Vanita feels that there is scope for improvement in efficiency of admin work and also she feels she can increase her knowledge in order to provide more information to the farmers.
	When asked about her overall experience, she said she has gathered more information to communicate with farmers in BCI, performed soil testing, and visited farmers' gatherings in village GPs. 	Field notes_FF_Vanita
FF2 - Rakesh (INTL 02)	- Rakesh has six villages and 445 farmers under him 
- He has been FF since 2 years 
- When asked about the tools for management, used by FF, Rakesh mentioned that  he uses his mobile phone for almost every work. He has to click photos and share with PUM on a daily basis - this leads to a lot of data and ultimately hangs up his phone. He said it would be nice if BC would provide them with tabs.
	Attendance: Minutes of every meeting / training is made by the FF. If he cannot make it in the meeting then he goes to his office and prepares the detailed version. Sign of every farmer is also taken in the LG attendance book after every meeting.  
FFB: Rakesh helping illiterate farmers in filling FFB. He said that literate farmers are able to fill the data correctly and the illiterate farmers usually make mistakes so we tell them to carry it during the meeting.  
Adoption data: - Rakesh said that he has the printout of the adoption data table and as per every farmer - the practices he follows, he ticks the relevant practices. 
- This data is then sent to the PUM - who further checks it and then enters in the computer. 
RIR: FF has nothing to do with RIR - only from FFB transfer to excel - this excel is an internal doc made by WWF (not as complex as RIR) 	- He meets with minimum 2 LGs per day 
- As per season training topics are taken up , one meeting lasts for one hour. 
- 1 LG - 1 adoption sheet 
- 15 days - training on 1 topic across all villages under him- FFs discuss with PUMs on topics to teach farmers. The meetings are conducted by Rakesh alone ( no supporting staff) - only some meetings PUM attend like on child labour, only-women meetings - once a month. APUM checks once in 15 days if we are having meetings or not. 
- General topics covered: soil health, biodiversity, how to increase fertility of land, reduction in water pollution, etc.
- Rakesh said that they provide green gram and red gram seeds to RA (regenerative agriculture) Demo farmers, not all the farmers. By helping reduce their investment costs, we've gained their trust, and they attend our meetings regularly. As a voluntary organization, we share valuable information, which strengthens their trust in us. During meetings, we explain the use of combination medicines, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, which encourages their continued participation.
- When asked on how he reaches out to farmers who do not attend meetings - he said he does home visits, follows up with them on phone and gives them a download of all the topics discussed and urges them to attend the following meetings. 
- Rakesh mentioned that he sometimes goes to SHG meetings where he finds all the women - he educates them on kitchen gardening, tailoring, knowledge on PPE kits, etc. 
- Once the cotton is plucked, Rakesh provides suggestions on storage - for eg. to keep it away from water, open storage better, etc. 	- His day starts at 6:30 AM, farmers are already informed about the meeting the previous evening. He gives training for one hour followed by field visits / observations: 30 mins 
- Office work : 3 hours 
- In may &amp; dec - well monitoring - 3 villages 
- Overall: Admin: 20% , Data: 30%, Capacity strengthening: 50% 
- Rakesh mentioned that he doesn't like (feels it is a time waste) to transfer well monitoring data from field to g sheets - it is not required 
- He said that instead this time could be used to train farmers who are not growing cotton but other crops like maize, paddy, etc. 
- When asked about the time taken for Farmers list - Rakesh said it takes 15 to 20 minutes from each farmer and it takes 2 to 3 days to collect info from one village and for all villages under him 10 to 15 days (annually - since farmer list is updated every year) 

When asked about what he would like to work more upon and what work he would like to reduce - 
- He said he would like it if data documentation work was reduced. Few farmers do not update / enter the wrong data -in their FFB, as a result of which data for RIR gets affected. When asked about how he knows that the correct info is filled in FFB he mentioned that the literate farmers fill data properly and he helps the illiterate ones. 
- Rakesh is interested in conducting training 
- He said that data is important as it supports farmers indirectly and also helps in monitoring their work.
	- Previously, farmers were investing Rs. 18,000 per acre, but now their expenditure has reduced to less than Rs. 15,000. 
- Before participating in the BCI project, farmers were heavily using DAP based on their own knowledge, but it wasn't yielding the expected results. 
- Rakesh also mentioned that they are providing vegetable seeds and connecting farmers with tailoring units, while also supplying more seeds for kitchen gardens.
- Through their Sustainable Land Management efforts, they have distributed plants to farmers in partnership with WWF. Additionally, they also provide border crops, such as coconut trees, to protect farm boundaries and help retain soil moisture.

Motivation of Rakesh: 
- “I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” 
- Rakesh feels immense pride that he has been able to reduce fertilizer usage which led to increase by 10 to 12 quintals per acre  
- When asked what he feels has been the impact of his work - &quot;I never recommend using pesticides; instead, I advocate for organic fertilizers like neem oil and homemade preparations. We use Agni Asram, neem, and Jeevamrutham, all of which are prepared on agricultural land. The soil quality has remained stable. We’ve organized rallies in villages to discourage the use of red-colored pesticides. During meetings, we conducted an intercropping demonstration using green grams, which not only increased soil carbon but also provided farmers with an additional income. We are also developing vermicompost.&quot;
- Rakesh has till date conducted over 50 trainings for farmers - he conducts meetings with other stakeholders too like workers, schools, ANMs, etc.) 
- Overall, Rakesh said he feels he has created a 70% impact and there is still scope for improvement. 
- As per Rakesh, there is a clear difference between BCI &amp; non-BCI cotton - quality, color and fibre, etc.  
- As per Rakesh, the highest impact of his work has been by educating farmers on bio pest, cow urine and cow dung 	- To have meetings at night (6:30 to 8:30 PM) - since farmers are free at that time 
	- Rakesh feels that the cultivation of Better Cotton is on the rise. He particularly appreciates the use of bio-pesticides and the preparation of neem oil by farmers. - A mixture of 5 kg cow dung, 5 liters of cow urine, 5 kg of jaggery, and soil is also used, and he finds this method effective. 
- Farmers are also preparing and using Trichoderma, which he highly values. Stem application is another method he favors; out of 30 farmers, 20 are using it. - This technique effectively eradicates sucking insects. What he loves most about stem application is that it prevents soil and environmental pollution, unlike spraying, which can cause harm. By applying directly to the plant stem, we ensure no damage to the soil or the environment.

(about stem application usage: Sixty percent of farmers are using stem application. Just 250 ml is sufficient for two acres. While spraying costs around Rs. 1,000, stem application costs only Rs. 200. It also saves time, taking just one hour compared to two for spraying. Overall, the investment is significantly lower. This method has been implemented since two years)

FF 3 - Ramesh (INTL23)	Monthly Planning and Execution: Prepare and implement the Monthly Action Plan. This includes planning village visits, scheduling meetings, and conducting awareness programs based on seasonal requirements.
Coordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information.
Reporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives.
Documentation: Maintain and verify Farmer Field Books (FFBs), write in diaries, and submit meeting minutes and signatures to the Field Manager.	Data Collection and Validation: Collect data from Lead Farmers, validate farmer lists through physical visits and phone calls, and update records accordingly. Ensure the accuracy of data by cross-checking information.
Monitoring Farmer Practices: Monitor farmers' adherence to guidelines, especially regarding the use of organic fertilizers and pesticides, and follow up to ensure continued compliance.
Result Indicator Reporting (RIR): Track and report on key performance indicators related to farmer practices and crop outcomes.


Data Validation: Cross-check data over the phone and through physical visits. Ensure data is updated and accurate.
Monitoring: Regularly monitor farmer practices, particularly the use of organic fertilizers and adherence to guidelines.
	Training and Awareness Programs: Conduct training sessions and awareness meetings with farmers on topics such as crop management, pesticide use, and environmental protection. Use Farmer Field Books (FFBs) to educate farmers on record-keeping.
Material Distribution and Demonstrations: Distribute educational materials like flexes, demonstrate techniques such as using sticky traps, and share videos via WhatsApp groups to reinforce training.
Promoting Sustainable Practices: Encourage the adoption of sustainable farming practices, including the use of Navadhanyalu (nine types of seeds) and reducing the use of chemical pesticides.
	Training Sessions: 30-40 minutes per session.
Field Visits: Daily from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with specific timings for meetings and fieldwork.
Post Noon - Office works mostly	Environmental Benefits: Reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, increased use of organic fertilizers, and improved environmental protection.
Farmer Benefits: Increased yield, reduced investment, and improved education for farmer children due to higher profits.
Adoption of Practices: High adoption rate of guidelines among farmers, 80% following the recommended practices.	Data Management: Ensuring accurate data collection and validation can be time-consuming 
Farmer Engagement: Not all farmers consistently maintain their Farmer Field Books - so have to sit and write diaries with them	Enhancing Female Participation: Plan and conduct more separate meetings for women farmers to increase their participation, especially considering the constraints they face such as domestic responsibilities and long distances.
Use of Technology: Integrate more audiovisual tools in training sessions to enhance understanding and retention among farmers.	Sustained Engagement Needed: Continued follow-up and engagement are crucial to prevent farmers from reverting to less sustainable practices if the project ends.
Capacity Building for Field Facilitators was asked by Ramesh	Field Facilitator  - Ramesh
FF 4 - Sony (INTL01)	Coordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information.
Reporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives.	Collects and verifies data through FFB, field visits, and phone calls.

Demonstrations: 20 minutes.
Home visits and follow-up meetings: Varies depending on the farmer's availability.	Significant reduction in pesticide use with a shift towards organic fertilizers.
Yield increase: Previously 7-8 quintals, now 10-11 quintals
Increased participation of female farmers due to targeted outreach through SHG meetings and home visits.
Effective implementation of PPE kits	RIR data collection is time-consuming, documentation of investment, expenditure, and profit for each farmer takes nearly 1h or more time.
Incorrect information provided by farmers due to lack of knowledge or skepticism/lack of trust of the FF at the initial stage.
Reluctance to share information directly for the fear of losing out on govt schemes, requiring additional time for explanation and persuasion.
Reliance on mobile phones for data entry, which is not always efficient.
	Suggestion to reduce documentation work to allocate more time for fieldwork and training.
Customized tablets to improve data management.

Female Participation:
Suggestions to link livelihood programs (tailoring, packing systems, embroidery, vegetable seeds packing) to increase female participation and empowerment.

Program Support:
Requests from farmers for additional support in providing PPE kits, which are currently unaffordable for many.	Lack of irrigation facilities is a significant challenge mentioned by farmers, so the FF would like BC to facilitate them.
The FF expressed pride in their role and its impact on farmers' knowledge and income.
The current frequency of meetings with the PU Manager and Assistant PU Manager is deemed sufficient, with regular follow-ups and discussions.	Sony_FF_Budidapally INTL01  - Interview

Sindhu (INTL 01) 	- Sindhu is working as PUM from 2 years 
- Program objectives as per Sindhu: Increase soil organic carbon, reduce pesticide toxicity, increase incomes, women empowerment and regenerative agriculture 
- Based on this we prepare activities that are locally relevant and we implement it on field through FFs 
- 9 FFs (incl. APUM) and 43 villages under Sindhu, 3018 farmers 
- From 2012 WWF has been part of this project. 
- Governing structure (from bottom level) - Farmer, FF, PUM, Navkranti FPCL, Project coordinator (WWF), BCI
- Sindhu reports to project coordinator - Satish 
	- Impact of work on BCI objectives: 
Initially the soil organic carbon - 0.32 now it is 0.38 
Women empowerment has increased 
Increase in adoption practices 
- Factors contributing to the success of the program: Our hard work &amp; FFs contribute to the success of the program 
- Highest impact: Working on the field, field interactions and conducting trainings  
- Lowest impact: Documentation is difficult. But data is important. 
- Aspects of work which are complex: Doing the compilation is a task and laborious work. She has told BCI many times to reduce the documentation. (BCI in process of developing an app for direct data entry)
- Time allocation of which of your responsibilities could be changed: Sindhu likes going on the field and conducting training - she said that farmers are also keen to learn and know more about tech (PB Knot, Cremigel, etc.) if we train them on this they are interested in its implementation. 
	Role of Sindhu under various categories of work: 

HR: Recruitment of FF (based on experience &amp; knowledge in farming, communication skills, motivation) 
After selecting she shares with Satish sir. 
Finance, Accounts: NA 
Project management: 
- Her day starts at 6:30 - 7 AM. FFs arrange for the farmers, then Sindhu goes and gives them training for an hour. If any farmer wants Sindhu to visit farm then she goes there too. 
- By 11:30-12 - home and lunch 
- By 1:30 - 2 - back to office (Huzurabad) - half an hour to one hour she talks to FF - understands their challenges, learnings, etc. 
- Then she does documentation work - Presently working on farmers list (updating last year list and entering farming data), well monitoring data (groundwater levels data), compiling of soil testing (this not everyday, from every 43 village 4 or 5 samples from each - cross checking of data) Minutes of training taken by FF - Sindhu cross checks that 
- Soil testing completed in may-june. Distributed soil health card to farmers and now compiling data ..
- Intercropping demo, stem application demo - to whom to give, etc. 
- Any work she finds complex - nothing as such, she is managing everything 
- Role of APUM - field visits with one FF, training, documentation verification &amp; monitoring - after coming to office we cross check with FF, etc. 
- Based on season, she decides which villages to go to - for eg. if any village has started with land prep then will prioritize that over another which has not yet.
Coordinator and facilitation of external assessment : NA 	Processes under MEL: 
- Cross checking: For each document there is a % which she cross checks. From each FF, 10 to 20% data is considered. So say if an FF has 4 villages under her - from each village 10% is considered and that sample is called and cross checked. 
- Each list / document is cross checked 10-20% (if the population is high) and 5 to 10% (if population is low) 
- This % was fixed internally by WWF. 
- APUM cross checks 40 to 50% 
- Project coordinator checks 3 to 5% 
- As per her, this process is reliable. If she finds any issues - she again tells the FF to cross check - so the process is very reliable. 
- Data is collected in google sheets, hard copies. Every document has a hardcopy - little difficult to manage but major data on google sheets. 

Management strategies: 
- We have a monitoring sheet with us when we go on field, she notes down in the sheet. 
- She also carries her diary and makes notes of suggestions, etc. We also come back and discuss with KVKs. 
- There is a whatsapp group of FFs + KVKs - so if FFs are unable to answer anything, they step in and answer. 
- Whatsapp group of only FFs + Sindhu 
- Whatsapp group with farmers 
- Village wise whatsapp group also 
- They put weather forecast info also 
- These groups also help farmers who have missed training to come to speed 

Factors that driver her: Her parents were farmers, she is interested in this and has a degree as well in soil science. 

Number of lists: Soil health (soil organic carbon, etc. is analyzed, we cross check if decreased or increased) &gt; Early season estimates (farmers list) &gt; well monitoring&gt; Demos are planned &gt; PRA data &gt; Activity / monitoring plan &gt; adoption plan &gt; FFBs &gt; RIR (post harvest estimates) 
What is the Farmers list approach? LGs, farmer codes for individual farmers, co farmers, irrigation data  etc. (for responsibilities wrt each list see detailed transcript)

How is the sample collected? 
- APUM - 40 to 50% of type of data, PUM - 10%, Satish sir - 3 to 5% 
- Demos are held based on seasons - for eg. sowing then spraying and Rallies (staff and villagers walking together with placards) are held in sept - august - for eg. not to use highly chemical pesticides, use PPE Kits, etc. - this way even Non - BC farmers get educated. 

Time spent on MEL work - Season wise lists are prepared - so her work also varies accordingly. Currently time for farmers list so her 1-2 weeks goes in that. After that some other data set.	- We train the FFs depending on season &gt;&gt; that they teach farmers 
- Communication material carried by FFs - flexes, pamphlets, door stickers. 
- We give special trainings also - to anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare workers, pesticide sprayers, school children - we tell them about Child Labour, to be away from hazardous chemicals, focus on education, etc.
- Every year 6 farmer trainings for each LG - she has 97 LGs 
- Each village 3-4 special activities / trainings 
- PUM role - Motivating farmers, if FFs cannot clarify anything then PUM comes in. 
- She is not sure if there is any efficient way to improve the MEL processes. She feels the current way is good. 
- Data is important - it helps understand if our training is working or not. 
	Overall: Admin: 10%, Data: 60%, CS: 30%

Sindhu wants to spend more time with farmers and less on documentation. If BCI gives any alternative then she would be happy. She would like to replace her data admin work with field work. Data entry burden must be reduced - cross checking, duplication data, etc. 	no challenges faced in execution 	- Any given farmer - may be growing multiple crops on his 5-6 acres of land. In such cases we train on other crops also - if farmers have queries on other crops we answer. 
- In paddy farming, work is much less compared to cotton - once transplantation is done for paddy - farmers just go to farm daily switches on pump machines and that's it. But for cotton, everyday farmers have to go and some or other work is there. Water availability is high here so many are opting for paddy. 
	Field notes_Sindhu_PUM
Nikita (INTL 23) 	- She has been the PUM since one year 
Objectives as per Nikita: to identify cotton farmers and increase their yields, support farmers from sowing to harvesting, to empower women, increase soil organic carbon and decrease GHG emissions. 
- 50% chance that farmers will adapt to activities easily accessible to them. Accordingly we make activity plan and conduct demos, training, etc. all this is based on local context, so that it is easy for them to adopt to it. 
- Farmers feel a bit uncomfortable in PPE Kit - we make them aware of its importance and disadvantages of not wearing it 
- Annually six trainings have to be conducted every LG 
	Highest impact: Giving training &amp; demos to farmers is very crucial - it is very important for FFs to be knowledgeable. Every aspect of BCI should be known by FF only then he will be able to explain to farmers. 
Low impact: Demos are only for few farmers (as impossible to give all farmers the inputs) - many farmers said that we come for training but you select only few. Nikita feels that if demos are done on a larger scale it will be more beneficial. 
Nikita said that the Demos have been crucial - there are cross learnings since farmers tell other farmers the benefits they have gained. Because of this even other farmers become curious to practice the same. At times it is difficult for them to understand that pesticides are harmful because the yields initially drop. So farmers are worried about this - other than this they follow most of the things. 
Complex work: documentation work is complex - sometimes we are not able to concentrate on training because of excessive data work. 	HR:Preliminary screening of candidates - and then send to Sindhu or Satish 
Finance, Accounts: NA 
Project Management: - To build activity plan according to which trainings are conducted as per pre determined timeline, Deadlines are fixed - cross checked, etc.
Coordinator and facilitation of external assessment: Self assessment, CB to FFs 
Others: Documentation work, Monthly twice review meetings, Daily field updates - we check FF phones if they have invited farmers and if few farmers have not attended why they have not attended. 

Systems &amp; processes: Yearly there is an activity plan - Nikita makes a to do plan every day and mentions deadlines for long term plans. In the internal FF review meetings (which is held twice monthly) she discusses a 15 day work plan with them. 

Tools used : Diaries, for FFs she uses board and for data computer 

Factors that drive you to execute your duties:  Personal interest in animals and nature. After her masters in Zoology, she was interning with WWF under Biodiversity Restoration project. She believes that if the environment is friendly then only the animals will survive. That is why she propagates using organic fertilizers. She believes that BCI principles are very close to her ideologies.	What data she handles? 
- Annually, we have to make a time bound plan, for which we have to know the key issues - collected by FF. This year we have an activity plan then a monitoring plan. 
- Soil sample testing - after that data compiled by FF, she puts it in the computer in prescribed BC format and then shares it to the project coordinator. 
- Action plan for FFs every month activities 
- Locally used pesticides list 
- Disadvantage list: we identify physically handicapped people and provide them livelihood -  we try to collaborate with govt. Schemes 
- Degraded lands identification - degraded lands identified and then restoration plan 
- FFB updation (routine) 
- Adoption 
- RIR 

How does she manage the data ?
- Every data is seasonal and accordingly we share hard copies with FF 
- Tools used for handling data: Hardcopies, internal WWF excel templates which FF fill and give me, google sheets are also used. 
- FF collect data from farmers and then give to PUM &gt;&gt; PUM checks / calls or one to one contact with farmers and rectify any issue &gt;&gt; - APUM also checks the data &gt; PUM &gt; Project coordinator 

About farmers list
- Annual updation 
- FF goes to the village and identifies cotton growing farmers and enrolls them. FF collects the data - if anyone is not growing cotton anymore then the same is mentioned. We filter him out and add new farmer. 

Types of data collected: See the detailed transcript 

Sample selection - randomly 

Steps taken to ensure quality and integrity of data collected: 
- She always cross checks. In the farmer list , we randomly select 10 farmers and call them up to cross check info. If there is a mismatch, then Nikita goes to FF and tells them to cross check the entire data  from her end. 
- 10% of sample size is chosen by me and if there is a mistake the full list is to be checked by FF. 
- APUM cross checks data and sometimes APUM also fills in data. 
- Note: PUM checks 10% from every village data - so FF may have 5 villages under him or her - 10% of every 5 villages (50). APUM checks 20 to 30% .. and project coordinator 3 to 5% 	- Trainings are conducted across 55 villages on the 6 BCI principles (55* 6). We also talk about RA practices (30 practices) - there is no separate training for this. In the same training we suggest farmers to do certain activities. 
- Trainings conducted till date: 12 *2 = 24 trainings 
- Frequency of the training: 1 FF will reach the same village twice a month. 
- At times, farmers are not interested in listening to me - most farmers are eager to get some input 
	Overall: Admin: 5% (Since sindhu helps her in most admin work), Data: 60%, CS: 35%

BCI had told us documentation will reduce, even though it has reduced we have to maintain some docs to show proof of farmers adhering to program objectives. It will be better if we get more time on field than data entry work, and will be better in understanding issues faced by farmers. 

Do you think the MEL systems are efficient? 
10% is currently done, for the errors to lessen it would be better if we considered 20 to 30% . Due to heavy documentation work it becomes difficult. 
	Challenges in execution / managing the PU position: 
- Deadlines are strict and sometimes we dont get data on time from farmers. For FF also it is difficult to collect data from farmers 
The above issue does not have effect on final project outcomes 
- Before BC project deadline, Satish sir has a deadline
	Collection of data should be done in another way so that it is easier to fill in data. No issue in CS since Satish sir always there with us.	Field notes_Nikita_PUM

Satish Botla. WWF PC 	- Satish is a consultant for WWF India , POC for BCI 
- Administrative + technical support for Karimnagar cluster, since 2012 (for other clusters - Satish assists in technical work)
Responsibilities: Divided in Admin &amp; Technical 
Broad responsibilities: 
Data collection for project proposals 
Submission of Annual data to BCI 
CB of staff, planning for farmer training - Satish mainly responsible for staff trainings (TOT) 
planning , cross checking of documentations, training, action plans, corrective action plans, project review, analysis of results, - his broad responsibilities 
Under technical -
Developing materials (like BCI principles recently changed - Satish translated in local language) includes material for training(PUMs and FFs), 
plan for conducting trainings - PUM &amp; FFs, 
Also involved in BCI licensing assessments (whatever support required from WWF), 
CAP 
Under Admin 
Monitoring - Satish visits the fields at least 2 to 3 times a week. He talks to them, understands their issue, takes inputs from them, etc. During internal review he discusses this with PUM (once a month) PUMs also conduct stock taking meeting with FFs one in 15 days 
(for each and every document there is a detailed monitoring protocol. For eg. FFB - Field staff will monitor 10%, PUM 3%, APM 5%, Satish 3% at project level not unit level) 
Monitoring, reviewing, staff recruitment 
(every village (earlier it was LG) has one demo farmer for whom we give green grams, biofertilizers, etc. and other activities) 
	Farmers list (annual): Giving training to PUM - how to fill, etc.  &amp; to Cross checking by Satish before sending to BCI
Tools used: They internally have made easy excels (not prescribed by BCI) key points required by BCI are shared with them, rest retained with us. 
Attendance list: NA (only when he goes on field he sees it - this comes mainly under the purview of FF / PUM) 
Training &amp; CS activities: PUM and PU staff training,(farmer training - FFs / PUM responsible) 
Adoption , RIR - Same as CS activities
FFB - No work but checks during field visits 

	CS for farmers: Satish gives training to PUMs / Field staff, not directly to farmers. During CS activities, FF may not know the answer to every question farmers ask - they call Satish and ask him / whatsapp him.	Admin: 20%, 
Data - 
Farmers list, Attendance, Training &amp; CS, Adoption, RIR, FFB : 25-30%
Trainings &amp; CS: 25-30%
Demos and Community level activities: 5-10% 

Max time in data and CS 

As per Satish, CB / CS and monitoring of fields of work are more helpful to farmers instead of data. 

Importance of Data : 
- Satish has discussed previously with BCI that such level of data collection is not required, data load is decreased alot now compared to 2012 -13 
- Reasons for doing FFB activity: BCI says for Farmer learning and RIR data 
- After many years of back &amp; forth: only 15% farmers in a PU are mandated to maintain FFB, rest voluntary. 
- No FFB was to be included in PURE - since farmers are interested in maintaining their own diary. Maintaining FFB also leads to increase in no. of training - how to fill, what units to fill, etc. 
- Satish said he would like to spend more time on training than being bogged down with data work 
- Satish had suggested that we (WWF) can make our own data templates to collect data - simple data - farmer name, village name, gender, mode of irrigation, contact - that's it. 
- Suggestion: Reduce data burden on FF / PUM. 
	- Because of WWF - BC thought of implementing a project at global level (H&amp;M) 
- Similarly for PURE, they are piloting with us (India) - this shows the trust they have in WWF. 
- None of the INTLs have lost any licensing - this speaks for our work. - We speak directly with BCI 
	Before data comes to Satish, it is checked 2 times (PUM and APUM) - so if they do a good job in checking my challenges are reduced automatically, but no other challenges as such. 	- The Appointment of MEL, CB manager has helped me put more time in other priority work where I am needed more. 
- More focus to be on capacity building. 
- Lot of docs in BCI, soft copies (1 TB finished) - Separate MEL manager will help us do effective analysis 
- Data including work burden of PUM instead of CS, in the self assessment report (every PU has this) for so many years, i have always given feedback that data needs to reduce inorder for PUMs to concentrate on field work 

Opinion on PUM / FF work allocation 
Depends from person to person 
75-80% of PUMs are doing well, 20-25% need to focus more on the project
	About Licensing: 

- Rigorous audits done by BC for licensing of PU - 4 days of audit 
- They choose the sample - not WWF. 
- Management - checking of docs, what are the planned activities, activity wise success indicators, etc. 
- Interview with PUM - They talk to PUM - as per BCI PUM, a very important / effective POC. - - They feel, if PUM is effective then the farmers will reap the benefits. Even the project - coordinator is not allowed to speak much during these meetings with PUM. 
- Field level - they will select some LGs (BC informs only 24 hours before about the sample to avoid any manipulation) -Farmer interviews are done- they ask BCI principles being followed are not - they check farmers knowledge and then the adoption - two main factors. 
- Other stakeholders - Workers - BC also interacts with field workers
- Verifiers will cross check with fertilizer shops and cross check if they are selling organic fertilizers mentioned by farmers in the vicinity,
- They also check with schools asking them if there is any child labor, etc. 
- Closing day - major findings are discussed 
- They prepare a report and submit it to BC India and they decide if the license will be continued or not. Types of licenses - Compliance with observation (means farmers may have knowledge but adoption is less - so they will give chance to see if there is any growth happening) 
- 64 Indicators under BCI - non-compliance with any one of the indicators - license is lost. 
- Licensing done once in three years. INTL 23 is pending for licensing this year. INTL 01 and 02 got licenses in the last 2 years.
	About ginners 

- Supply chain very big challenge in BCI 
- BC program farmers do not necessarily go to BC licensed Ginner 
- BC program farmers wanted more money per quintal - premium 
- Ultimate benefit of this project is to the environment 
- Biggest cotton market - Jammikunta - Rs. 100-150 price higher compared to other markets. Reason: There are a lot of ginning mills in Jammikunta, so prices are competitive. 
- There is a BCI portal for registered ginners and spinners. 
- Ginners are not getting a lot of benefit and hence are not keen on continuing with the license.

Topics covered: Intercropping, usage of bio pesticides, PPE kits usage, usage of cow urine, cow dung, neem oil, proper hand wash, precautions to be taken by pregnant women, health issues pertaining to women, 
Convenience &amp; facilities provided: Training are conducted at their convenient time, They are provided chairs during the trianing 
Solving of doubts: They are able to easily communicate their doubts with FF and they also said that the FFs don't treat male and female farmers differently, all the topics are well explained to both the genders.  
All farmers maintaining FFB - they write daily expenses , what plants they are growing, seeds cost, fertilisers cost, tractor rent, etc. 
When asked about the extent to which the training adds to your knowledge and awareness - they said ‘Medium’ 
They like attending trainings and don't get bored since it is interactive 
Women-only training are also conducted on bio pesticides, etc. (last conducted during sowing season) 
Sharing of knowledge: Women share their knowledge with other non-BC farmers
Farmers who have cattle make use of it to get organic pesticides; others who don't buy it from shops. 
Farmers mentioned that the pesiticides costs are very high and yield is low. 
What do they like most about the BCI program? Avoiding pesticides - using organic fertilisers and intercropping. 
	Demos are also held at frequent intervals - where they make placards of slogans like ‘Do intercropping’- this was even the non-BC farmers get educated 
Exposure and field visits are also conducted – at a convenient time. Farmers learned about the exposure visits by seeing on neighboring farmers 
Farmers who attend exposure visits - it depends on their transportation availability, per batch 18 farmers will attend. 
As per the women - most impactful is - Exposure visits and rewarding of farmers with high yield by BC 	Reduced usage of chemicals - they are aware they should not use heavy chemicals as it will affect their health. 
Increase in yield, good quality crops 
High market rates - earlier it was Rs.1500/- to Rs. 1800/- per quintal, it is very less. After joining in BCI it is an increased  quintal rate of Rs.7500/-.
Farmers have adopted inter cropping and border cropping (yellow gram) after joining the BC program. 
Able to grow 2 crops yearly - one is cotton and other we grow vegetables which we use in our household. 
Adoption of PPE kits
Upgrade in their standard of living: The women said that after being part of BC - many have purchased TV, fridge, bike, tractor 
They make 20 to 30k profit per acre per season 
Overall, less expenditure 
The women said that they have seen a change in the past 5 years - earlier they used to use pesticides (urea, DAP, cocktails) due to which crop used to get full damaged but now using organic fertilizers &gt;&gt; overall income increased and fertilizer investment decreased 
Farmers not using red color pesticides as they understand it is harmful to their health.

	Women also mentioned that after being part of the BC program, husbands are allowing them for meetings and venturing outside the house without any hesitation.

	Role of men &amp; women on farms: 
- Females typically handle tasks like picking flowers from cotton plants, while male farmers press the cotton, fill the bags, and carry them. Both men and women contribute equally to the work, though their tasks differ. 
- Women are more involved in activities like picking and sowing, which are traditionally considered women's work. In contrast, men focus on spraying, applying fertilizers, carrying heavy bags, and managing water flow. 
- Agricultural field work usually takes place from 9 am to 5 pm. 
- However, if they have other responsibilities, many male workers spend about three hours in the field before moving on to other livelihood activities.

Education and jobs attained by farmers children 
- Farmers do not allow their children on field as it affects their health and education 
- Many of the children have completed their education, starting from 10th grade and progressing to at least graduation, with some attaining post-graduation. 
- After completing their studies, many have secured private sector jobs, with both males and females working, including those employed in Hyderabad. 
- Among the group of approximately 100 youth, all are currently engaged in various jobs.
- They dont want their kids to be in agriculture (during the FGD kids of two ladies were sitting with us - one had a degree in BSc. Agriculture and other too was pursuing a similar degree) 	Effect of climate change 
- The farmers said that if there are no rains they will suffer huge losses. Only 2 to 5% of people have borewells 
- If the rains are no there they grow fodder crops and give it to their cattle 

- Depending on the quality of cotton, they decide who to sell to - if good quality then they go to ginner and sell and if not so good then vendors who come to village. 
- During summers, the ladies are also enrolled for the ‘100 days work’ program 
- All the ladies had bank accounts 

Suggestion: They would like to be provided with good quality seeds  / subsidy on seeds.

Choppadandi (INTL 23) 	- Part of program since: From 3 years they are part of BC program - but have been growing cotton from 20 years 
- Women said that they use chemicals 
- Land owners grow paddy and for cotton these women go on other farms 
- They use organic fertilizers on their own land (neem oil)
- Their husbands also working on cotton farms (on leased lands) 
- No soil testing has been done so they have no idea what to grow 
- Support from family: They dont tell anything to their husbands about things learned in training as they say they already know 
But in terms of support from family, it is there. Husbands are supportive of women working in the field. 	No. of trainings conducted: In 2024, till now 3 women trainings have been conducted 
For men, season wise, monthly 2 trainings 	They have got trainings only on health and certain precautions to take and safety 
Topics covered: In the training they have been taught precautionary measures like Covering of hair, covering of nose and moth to avoid dust, covering of cotton with proper cover and in  proper places, pregnant women should not involve in chemical and pesticides usage, avoid child labour, practive intercropping to improve fertility in the land. 
Every BC farmer follows the above practices. 
Freely speak in meetings: During the meetings, husband and wife both speak up freely and there is no restriction. If women have any doubts they ask FF 
Convenience &amp; facilities provided: During the training, BC provides chairs, toilet facilities are taken care of and also water. Trainings are conducted from 7 to 8 PM. 
When asked about why they do not attend the trainings - they said that if meetings are conducted nearby they will be able to attend. 

	- There have been no demos, rallies organized for BC women farmers  
- Demos for men farmers have been conducted on intercropping, nav dhanya usage, etc. 	Practices followed
Sticky traps 
Men use neem oil in field women dont know how it is to be used 
They use cocktails 
They use ‘green color’ pesticides 
They use mask in field 
Intercropping and border cropping followed 

Women on pesticide usage
The women reported using bio pesticides, nav-dhanya and they also use gloves 
Women are not averse to organic pesticides but they have tried using it in the past and it didn't help them so they don't believe in using organic pesticides. 
They use urea, potassium- before 10 years they used to use organic - but now chemical as chemicals lead to faster growth as compared to organic
Once they tried using neem oil for killing pests but they did not see any result - lost trust on organic 
	Women said that the training has had no impact on their empowerment 	Suggestion on training: There is no new / special information that we have come to know about, meetings are very lengthy / time consuming which makes it difficult for them to stay full time as they have to attend to house chores AND agriculture work. They suggested keeping the meeting for half an hour. 

Overall Suggestions: Women said that they would like to have more season wise trainings but only night / evening time convenient for them as they are free then 

They also suggested to provide cotton storing bags. Big farmers are able to purchase storage materials but small farmers find it difficult. It would be nice if BC could provide us with good quality storage bags

	Field notes_co farmers_Kanagarthi
Sambyapalli (INTL 23) 	(Dhanish) 	Part of BCI program for 2 years.
There is a perception that without pesticides, cotton crops do not grow well. However, since joining the BCI program, they have shifted from using DAP urea to using organic fertilizers like animal dung, as promoted by the project.
Farmers expect to receive seeds, such as vegetable and cotton seeds, on a free or subsidized basis. They also expect to receive PPE kits for agricultural work.
Any income from cotton farming is used for the family, with profits contributing to family expenses like shopping. There is an expectation that any training or meetings should lead to direct benefits, such as financial support or resources.

Challenges in Training Implementation: Despite attending meetings, 70% of farmers are not following the recommended practices due to negligence or other priorities.	Farmers attended 4 to 5 meetings where topics like cotton crop precautions and organic fertilizer usage were discussed.
Most cotton-related meetings are attended by men.
Meetings after 7 pm are said to be more convenient, especially during the summer when they have no work and children are not in school.
Women prefer separate meetings due to discomfort with men, especially as many men attend meetings drunken - they reported disturbed by the smell of alcohol.
	Usefulness of Trainings: Farmers found the trainings useful, particularly for growing Better Cotton. The meetings helped them understand the benefits of organic fertilizers and the importance of using PPE kits.
Challenges in Training Implementation: Despite attending meetings, 70% of farmers are not following the recommended practices due to negligence or other priorities.

Demonstrations and Exposure Visits: Some farmers have participated in exposure visits to other agricultural fields. These visits and demonstrations (e.g., on border crops, intercropping, and bio-fertilizers) were found to be beneficial.
Participation in rallies was low, especially among women due to domestic responsibilities.	Shift to Organic Practices: There has been a shift toward using organic fertilizers and border crops, which has led to an increase in yield. However, farmers are still heavily reliant on labor, which drives up costs.Children's Involvement: On holidays, children help with agricultural work, and their education continues. 
Boys typically pursues post-graduation. The average marriage age is after completing education, around 21 years. Education of girls mostly stop after marriage	Women’s Involvement: Women are increasingly participating in agricultural decisions and meetings.
Household Decision-Making: Women engage in mutual discussions with their husbands regarding farming decisions, and they feel empowered to suggest changes, although not all suggestions are accepted.
Self-Help Groups (SHGs): SHG meetings focus primarily on savings rather than agriculture. Female farmers expressed a desire for SHG activities to also include agricultural topics.	Co-Farmer Sambyappalli - FGD

- Many of the children have completed their education, starting from 10th grade and progressing to at least graduation, with some attaining post-graduation. 
- After completing their studies, many have secured private sector jobs, with both males and females working, including those employed in Hyderabad. 
- Among the group of approximately 100 youth, all are currently engaged in various jobs.
- They dont want their kids to be in agriculture (during the FGD kids of two ladies were sitting with us - one had a degree in BSc. Agriculture and other too was pursuing a similar degree) 
Other topics covered 	Effect of climate change 
- The farmers said that if there are no rains they will suffer huge losses. Only 2 to 5% of people have borewells 
- If the rains are no there they grow fodder crops and give it to their cattle 

- Depending on the quality of cotton, they decide who to sell to - if good quality then they go to ginner and sell and if not so good then vendors who come to village. 
- During summers, the ladies are also enrolled for the ‘100 days work’ program 
- All the ladies had bank accounts 

Suggestion: They would like to be provided with good quality seeds  / subsidy on seeds.
	Suggestion on training: There is no new / special information that we have come to know about, meetings are very lengthy / time consuming which makes it difficult for them to stay full time as they have to attend to house chores AND agriculture work. They suggested keeping the meeting for half an hour. 

Overall Suggestions: Women said that they would like to have more season wise trainings but only night / evening time convenient for them as they are free then 

They also suggested to provide cotton storing bags. Big farmers are able to purchase storage materials but small farmers find it difficult. It would be nice if BC could provide us with good quality storage bags

Gender Analysis Matrix
Awareness of the Better Cotton program	- This village was newly considered for the BC program. 
- Women did not see training conducted in the village - they are not aware of it. 
- They grow cotton .. and maize, red gram, etc. as intercrop 
- Women mentioned that rains are a big issue - due to lack of it their crops get affected. If they get good rains they believe their crop will also be good. Last season they made huge losses due to no / lack of rains. 
	- Farmers have been growing cotton since 20 years 
- Paddy, Maize, Grams are grown seasonally
- Farmers were not aware of BC 

Experience as a non-program farmer participant in WWF/Better Cotton training programs	- They have not attended any meetings in the past 
- They use chemicals like Urea, DAP, Cocktails 
	- Two out of the 8 farmers have attended a better cotton training - five to six times 
- Some women said that they could not attend any meetings in the past as the timings always used to clash with their farm timings and also sometimes they used to be busy sending children to school, cooking, etc. 

Expectations as a non-program farmer from the Better Cotton training programs	-They were keen to know how to grow cotton crop through BC and be a part of the BC program.
-Women are ok attending training but it should be at a convenient timing 
- Women would like to learn about new methods to get good quality cotton 
	- All the farmers said that they would be happy to be part of BC program if the trainings are conducted at convenient timings, currently they are not held at a convenient time (5pm to 7.30pm - convenient time)
- Farmers said it would be useful for them to know how to grow good quality cotton 

Knowledge, attitude and practices (capacity) related to cotton farming	- Women are responsible for sowing, weeding while men take care of pesticides related work 
- Women use old shirts / pants / handkerchief/ cap as PPE - they don't wear gloves - they use helmet , eye protection 
- Women said that - per season they earn close to Rs. 20 to 25 thousand, after deducting all expenses. 
- Women were not much aware of the practices: 
They knew about child labour 
They used PPE kits 
They used chemicals 
They used cow dung 
They were not aware of Pheromone traps 
They were asking for subsidy 
They are aware of insecticides

	- Child labour is not practiced, education is prioritized instead
- Farmers are using chemical fertilizers like DAP, urea, potash. They also use sheep dung in the fields 
- Farmers are practicing inter cropping, border cropping 
- Farmers are not aware of pheromone traps, they use cocktails, 
- However, they do not use the red color pesticides 

Other topics 	- Women were not aware of the pesticides costs - they said their husbands know 
- Water is a big issue in the area - intercropping tends to use less water 
- Most of the farmers in the village have dug borewells but there is no water 
- Women were also engaged in the NREGA 100 days work where they ears Rs. 150/- per day. 
- Soil testing has been done in their farms and they received the results also but they mentioned that their husbands only look into it and they are not aware. 
- Some women of the villages were also giving milk to houses. 
- Their children are finding it difficult to get jobs, govt. Jobs are less - so most opt for private 
	- Farmers are involved in 100 days work program of MGNREGA - when there’s no work on the field (Summer)
- Decision Making is largely Male centric
- The male members complained of a lack of response from BC after they gave their soil for tests - despite multiple requests

Participant 	Kanagarthi (INTL 02)	Sambyapalli (INTL 23) 
Gender Analysis Matrix	(Dhanish) 
Experience and expectations as a Co-farmer in the BC program	- It has been 4 years since BCI came into the village but they have been growing cotton since 20-25 years 
- Women mentioned that they grow vegetables in their house yard and use it at home for meals 
- Women also said that marriage is a barrier to work. Most are not finding work nearby
- Women have an influence / decision making authority in the household - and their husbands listen to them. 
- Farmers said that chemical fertilizers cost them a lot. 
- Farmers wear head scarves, gloves, old blouses, and shoes. Farmers get their own clothes stitched by a tailor. 
- Women mentioned that they support their husbands in farming as one income is not sufficient to run the house 
- 47 farmers are growing cotton this year - some farmers practice crop rotation with paddy. So depending on water availability they decide to grow either paddy or cotton.
- Other crops grown: maize and paddy 	Part of BCI program for 2 years.
There is a perception that without pesticides, cotton crops do not grow well. However, since joining the BCI program, they have shifted from using DAP urea to using organic fertilizers like animal dung, as promoted by the project.
Farmers expect to receive seeds, such as vegetable and cotton seeds, on a free or subsidized basis. They also expect to receive PPE kits for agricultural work.
Any income from cotton farming is used for the family, with profits contributing to family expenses like shopping. There is an expectation that any training or meetings should lead to direct benefits, such as financial support or resources.

Challenges in Training Implementation: Despite attending meetings, 70% of farmers are not following the recommended practices due to negligence or other priorities.
Attendance in trainings	Convenience / facilities provided: They like to attend trainings and are provided with chairs and water during the training. 
Topics covered: safety / precaution measures - wearing gloves, mask - inter croppping &amp; border cropping 
No. of training: It depends on the season. During cotton season at least 2 meetings per month which last about ½ hr to 45 mins. 
They like the trainings because they feel they learn new things and it is more interactive in nature compared to videos 
They also like field visits 
Do not enjoy videos much 
Rally is conducted during season, FF explains the reason behind rally 
No. of people per training: 50 - both husband and wife attend training. Time and distance are major factors influencing their decision to attend the training. 
Discussion with non - BC farmers: Women discuss the learnings from meeting with each other , also with non-BC farmers 
There is no discrimination between the male and female farmers. 
Whatever queries are raised in the meeting, FF understands and addresses them
FFB - Literate persons fill themselves, daily with help from children -they fill info on their expenses, yield, etc. 
For the exposure visits, FF takes all the farmers to show them the improvement so that they are also motivated to adopt sustainable practices 

 Effectiveness of trainings	- Women claimed that they didn't know about wearing gloves before but came to know about it after the BC program 
- Before the BC program they used to use chemicals like urea and now after being part of the BC program they use compost, neem oil, etc. 
- No use of cocktail since 3-4 years 
- Decreased investment on the field
- Farmers mentioned that they are incurring lower costs than before BC because of use of organic fertilisers. FFs encouraged them to use organic fertilisers. 
	Usefulness of Trainings: Farmers found the trainings useful, particularly for growing Better Cotton. The meetings helped them understand the benefits of organic fertilizers and the importance of using PPE kits.
Challenges in Training Implementation: Despite attending meetings, 70% of farmers are not following the recommended practices due to negligence or other priorities.

Demonstrations and Exposure Visits: Some farmers have participated in exposure visits to other agricultural fields. These visits and demonstrations (e.g., on border crops, intercropping, and bio-fertilizers) were found to be beneficial.
Participation in rallies was low, especially among women due to domestic responsibilities.
Effectiveness of other capacity strengthening initiatives (demonstrations/ exposure visits. other activities etc)
Change in knowledge, attitude and practices (capacity) related to cotton farming
	- They have not made use of cocktails since last 4 to 5 years because of health issues 
- Soil testing is done for free every year before sowing season. They get the results after 15 days and as per the result they decide what to plant, what fertilisers to use , etc. 
- Farmers reported using the vermicompost 
- Farmers also mentioned that the yields are higher when they use organic fertilizers compared to chemicals. 
- Farmers are aware of the health issues emanating from use of chemicals like lung and skin allergies. 
- Farmers do not let children work on the farms. 
- Farmers children are studying till degree and for private jobs they go to Hyderabad 	Shift to Organic Practices: There has been a shift toward using organic fertilizers and border crops, which has led to an increase in yield. However, farmers are still heavily reliant on labor, which drives up costs.Children's Involvement: On holidays, children help with agricultural work, and their education continues. 
Boys typically pursues post-graduation. The average marriage age is after completing education, around 21 years. Education of girls mostly stop after marriage
Change in agency/empowerment	- Women's participation increased in meeting since last few years
- Husbands were earlier reluctant to hear the women farmers, since the training - they have gotten a voice / a say. As the knowledge increases, women get authority to be better opinionated, agency. 
- Women also mentioned that they get money in their hands and they dont have to report every expenditure to their husbands. 
- Overall, women feel empowered  
- Women liked knowing about intercropping and organic fertilizers

Suggestions: Seeds on subsidy basis.
	Women’s Involvement: Women are increasingly participating in agricultural decisions and meetings.
Household Decision-Making: Women engage in mutual discussions with their husbands regarding farming decisions, and they feel empowered to suggest changes, although not all suggestions are accepted.
Self-Help Groups (SHGs): SHG meetings focus primarily on savings rather than agriculture. Female farmers expressed a desire for SHG activities to also include agricultural topics.

Participant 	About Ginners 	Transcript 
Satish Botla, WWF PC 	About ginners 

- Supply chain very big challenge in BCI 
- BC program farmers do not necessarily go to BC licensed Ginner 
- BC program farmers wanted more money per quintal - premium 
- Ultimate benefit of this project is to the environment 
- Biggest cotton market - Jammikunta - Rs. 100-150 price higher compared to other markets. Reason: There are a lot of ginning mills in Jammikunta, so prices are competitive. 
- There is a BCI portal for registered ginners and spinners. 
- Ginners are not getting a lot of benefit and hence are not keen on continuing with the license.

Third Party Verifier 
Participant 	Roles and responsibilities of third-party verifiers	Compliance to credibility
	Sampling	Level of confidence in assurance results	Link to transcript 
Yunus 	Sequential Role in Verification Process:

Third-party verifiers are involved after the first and second assurances are conducted.
The Producer Unit (PU) serves as the first party in the verification process, while BCI acts as the second party.
The third-party verifiers are external entities brought in to ensure impartiality and objectivity in the verification process.
Key Roles:

Licensing Audits: Third-party verifiers conduct audits to assess whether Producer Units (PUs) meet the criteria for licensing.
Surveillance Audits: These audits are conducted to assess risks and ensure that PUs continue to comply with BCI standards over time.
Verification and Monitoring:

The major process undertaken by third-party verifiers is the verification and monitoring of BCI practices.
This process involves a thorough review and assessment of activities on the ground within a limited sample size, ensuring that the practices of the PU align with BCI standards.
	Pre-Verification Preparation:
Notification: The PUs are informed of the upcoming verification only 7 days in advance.
Random Sampling: Farmers are chosen randomly for the field verification process to ensure unbiased results.
Document Review: Prior to field visits, verifiers review documents provided by the PU. This review is limited to understanding the system without being influenced by existing data or statistical analysis.

Risk Profiling:
Stakeholder Engagement: Verifiers conduct interviews with three different stakeholders who are not directly related to the PU (e.g., KVK, Sarpanch, school teachers) without the PU’s knowledge. These interviews help assess potential risks and gather insights into issues such as child labor, farmer suicides, and other relevant sectoral challenges.

Field Verification:
Arrival and Initial Procedures:
Opening Meeting: Verifiers hold an opening meeting with field-level farmers, PU managers, and officials.
Interviews and Clarifications: Interviews are conducted with various stakeholders, including farmers, PU managers, and other relevant staff. If any discrepancies or unclear areas arise, clarification meetings are held.
Field Visits: A small team (typically 2-3 people) conducts farm visits to observe and verify field-level documentation and practices.
On-the-Field Activities:
Verification of Documentation: Field documentation is checked to ensure accuracy and compliance with BCI standards.
Interviews: Workers, farmers, and PU staff are interviewed to cross-check information.
External Source Engagement: Engagement with external sources, such as community leaders or local authorities, is conducted to gather additional insights.
Data Collection: All gathered data is meticulously recorded for further analysis.
Data Triangulation:

Daily Triangulation: Verifiers carry out daily data triangulation, comparing and cross-referencing new data with previous indicators.
Debate and Consensus: Different verification teams may have varying perspectives and findings. These are debated internally to reach the most accurate and factual conclusions before reporting.
Reporting:

Data Submission: The collected and triangulated data is submitted to BCI.
Review and Amendments: BCI may request modifications or cross-check the data before making any decisions.
Final Report: A final report is prepared, encapsulating all findings and recommendations.

Post-Verification:
No Decision-Making Role: After submitting the data to BCI, third-party verifiers do not participate in the decision-making process regarding the PU’s eligibility for licensing.
Licensing Considerations: BCI's licensing decisions are based on the submitted data, the PU's history with RIR submissions, the credibility of the data, and the quality of communication.
BCI Involvement:
Limited Accompaniment: BCI staff do not accompany the verifiers at all times, ensuring the independence of the third-party verification process.
BCI supports verifiers with date coordination, Point of Contact (PoC) arrangements, and training - 7 trainings- (both online and offline) to enhance the credibility of assessments.

Topics discussed:
Standards and Updated Procedures of BC, Recent Developments and Informations in the cotton sector, Trainings are held on pre/mid/end season-wise themes.	Sample Size Calculation:

Sampling is conducted using purposive sampling, with a typical sample size of 15 farmers, which is considered adequate and precise.

Sample Selection:
BCI provides the sample size and representation guidelines. The third-party verifier selects the sample within these guidelines, ensuring it is inclusive and representative of the entire PU.
Factors such as gender representation and geography (e.g., irrigation levels) are considered during sample selection.

Challenges in Sampling:
- Local partners inability to properly execute and assist the 3rd Party (leads to more time spend on engaging with the PU)
- Time constraints, especially when the sample includes distant locations (e.g., villages over 100 km apart), making it difficult to thoroughly cross-check the farmers' list and other data.
 	The level of confidence in the current assurance processes is generally high.
The robustness of the sample selection process, despite the small size, contributes positively to confidence.
Factors Positively Influencing Confidence:

The ability of the third-party verifier to choose the sample independently.
The systematic approach of daily data triangulation and cross-checking.

Within the 3 days on the field days, continuous cross checking are carried out 
Triangulation within different sources - Govt, reports etc
Triangulation with past yrs data (adoption data of this year vis a vis last year)

Independent teams can have different findings - debated and cross verified
Uploaded to Excel,  Review - Cross Checkings with the data collector - Desk Review (before the final submission to BC) is done by increasing the sample size etc if there's a discrepancy or confusion. 

Factors Negatively Influencing Confidence:
Duration constraints (e.g., the 3-day fieldwork period) limit in-depth investigations

Limitation in shared data: Data shared should be broad. Currently it is only from the respective PU - rather than the overall data making it difficult to crosscheck (There has been instances where the PUs/LGs disqualified often change their name (INTL X to INTL Y) with the farmers still same. Since the Verifier is only given 3 days onfield - time constraints force such instances difficult to be caught)	Copy of Third Party Verifier-Yunus Interview (MD)

Lalit Sharma 	Assurance approach (to understand if PUs are complying to BC standards or not - includes lists etc.) 
- It differs between the PU - licensing for old vs new 
- Partners conduct internal assessment of PU before BC licensing 
- Old PUs - assessment visit, license for three years, whenever it is getting expired BC will do it. 
- Surveillance assessment is for those who have an active license - incase there is any change in farmer participation or if there is any red flag raised in previous visits - then this assessment is conducted. 
- Assurance activities are mostly time bound 
- Assurance is an umbrella term - licensing is just a part of it. Even assessment comes under it like data verification, etc.

Assessment process (Assurance is the umbrella term and assessment is a part of it)
- There are principles and criteria in place which have some indicators in them
- PUs have to comply to these principles 
- Assurance team comprises - 2 sets of assessors (BC + third party verifiers) - 4 organizations currently empanelled as TPV. People like lalit who do assessment - 4 to 5 people 
- PUs are intimated one week in advance - a template is shared with them which outlines the requirements. There are some docs also which are required to be submitted by PU before the assessment - we give them three days to give it to us.
	Role of Lalit : 
- He has joined BC 4 years ago and is  working as Assurance Cooridnator &gt;&gt; he has a reporting manager 
- He is involved in - Assurance activities: 
- Data management (farmers list, adjusted figures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data)  
- Assurance activities calendar preparation  (licensing, etc.) 
- Training of PUMs / FFs on various lists
- Purpose of assurance - whether PUs are complying to standards or not. Within assurance we have different compliances (like list) + assessment conducted every three years. Assurance activities are defined set of requirement for eg. data - early season data, adjusted figures after one month of sowing, farm level data, self assessment, etc. 
- Before the start of the season we approach program partners to ask them about sowing dates, harvesting - based on these dates we decide the calendar activity for PUs 
- Lalit gets data in separate files as per INTL
Expectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors: 
- Requirements to partners made clear 
- We plan our activities in advance so that partners are aware of when to submit 
- We also ensure that data from the field is of good quality - we thoroughly investigate it. 
- All communication from our end should be on time so that PCs have time to complete on time. 
Role of BC staff &amp; TPV same - 3 day exercise 
- 1st day: opening meeting - PUs give introduction / PPT - interview with staff members, During this meeting, they also inform the villages that the team will be visiting the next day
- 2nd day: 2 LGs are covered - 5 farmers from each LG minimum - farmers + workers are interviewed. On this day we tell them about the next day's villages. 
- 3rd day: Morning - 1 LG - 5 farmers meeting - Post lunch: closing remarks / meeting. We dont give any recommendations or idea of how the PU is doing - all that goes in the report. 
- After this - we make a report and submit it to the India Assurance Team and also to the global assurance team. Licensing is in their hands. 
- BC staff and TPV visits separately to separate PUs - we have a ratio of 60:40 - 60% assessment will be done by TPV and 40% by BC. 
- Assessment process same as above 
- There is flexibility in conducting the interviews - more than 3 LGs can also be interviewed - minimum is 3 
- TPV also has to submit a report to India Assurance Team
Support provided by BC to TPV and WWF 
- CS vertical - Relationship management team - in touch with WWF Telangana - we provide the standard protocol to the partners - it is up to them how they want to design the meetings / training calendar -they just have to comply with the principles. Incase PC wants any clarification or want to access a knowledge partner then BC conducts TOT. 
- We have separate templates for different data sets - we train the PUMs and PCs on how to fill this template - since RIR is technical. 
	Integrity of Data: 
- Earlier we had encountered the issue of fake farmers - when we receive the list of farmers from PU we cross check by calling a few farmers and asking them if they know they are a part of the BC program. 
- We have details of PU Staff - who are responsible for particular LGs - we call at least 5-10 farmers under each FF (non lead farmers since they are reliable) 
- Random selection of 5-10 farmers - we used to ask their names, father names, whether they know BC program 
- Right now they dont do this calling exercise - we have told partners that we can do this cross check anytime 
- Processes followed currently - whenever they receive a file they look from quality POV - correct format, units, duplication, etc. 
- For different data sets we have different cleaning exercises. For eg. RIR is checked by the global team. We just glance and check for basic things and follow the global team - they do a deep dive 
Factors considered for credibility in assessment process 
- Process are designed in a way that is impartial 
- It is recommended to assessors not to give suggestions to PUs during their visits 
- Anti bribery policy - no gifts to be considered from PUs 
Risks considered 
- When we used to inform PU about the assessment dates they used to revert saying there is xx festival - so we have asked partners to share dates with us 
- Recently 1 PU told us that there is some staffing issue and all the FFs had got terminated so they asked for time extension - sometimes even PUM not well etc. - so if particular staff is not available we assess how crucial they are for our assessment - if not very crucial then we are ok and continue with the assessment 
- Weather issues - farmers are not in mood to talk when weather is not good 
Efficiency in assurance process 
- Approach is good enough 
- We have an arm for CS also which is unique to BC 
- We have a whole picture in the three day assessment - at the end of the day we want to understand the impact 
- We only talk to 15 farmers but this is good to get an idea - as general practices are same across LGs 
Factors contributing to non compliance from farmers 
- Adoption of PPE kit - we want farmers to use them but weather conditions are such they dont wear 
- Sometimes extension agents (pesticide vendors) tell farmers to mix chemicals 
- Certain chemicals BC bans but it is cheap and easily available to farmers so they opt for it (for eg. monocrotophos) 
- We have run campaigns to discourage such behavior
How do the existing assurance systems and processes work to mitigate the risks/ influence associated with free riders and non-BC farmers?
This will remain a challenge - we dont have details of ALL farmers since we dont have resources for that. Even in the PURE we cant say there wont be free riders 


	- In the limited time we have (3 days) - 15 farmers is fair - but we also do FGDs to cross check 
- Sample size is fixed for us - 15 - random sampling 
- We also talk to local resources - pesticides shop owner, sarpanch, etc. 
- Therefore , 15 farmers + FGDs + local resources is good enough 
- We are well versed on how to talk to farmers and we are also well versed with the geography - makes our job easier 
- He feels the sample size is representative - sampling is done on our own as in the LG selection is on us. We do it on following factors - based on rain fed farmers, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, response of FF in opening meeting 
- Selection bias prevention - Assessors select the LGs 
- Respondent bias prevention - we are as objective as possible 
- Scope of the assessment (duration and sample) limit the assessors’ ability 
In case we feel that three LGs is not enough or if something is inconclusive - we are free to consider 4 or 5 LGs 
- Challenges in assurance process 
- Nothing as such - just the risks i mentioned above
- Remote locations - traveling becomes too far - even between LG farmers 
	- Means of verification used to validate/triangulate the findings - FGDs + local resource information
- For rating of level of confidence please see detailed transcript	Notes_Assurance_BC Staff_Lalit
Satish Botla. WWF PC 	About Licensing: 

- Rigorous audits done by BC for licensing of PU - 4 days of audit 
- They choose the sample - not WWF. 
- Management - checking of docs, what are the planned activities, activity wise success indicators, etc. 
- Interview with PUM - They talk to PUM - as per BCI PUM, a very important / effective POC. - - They feel, if PUM is effective then the farmers will reap the benefits. Even the project - coordinator is not allowed to speak much during these meetings with PUM. 
- Field level - they will select some LGs (BC informs only 24 hours before about the sample to avoid any manipulation) -Farmer interviews are done- they ask BCI principles being followed are not - they check farmers knowledge and then the adoption - two main factors. 
- Other stakeholders - Workers - BC also interacts with field workers
- Verifiers will cross check with fertilizer shops and cross check if they are selling organic fertilizers mentioned by farmers in the vicinity,
- They also check with schools asking them if there is any child labor, etc. 
- Closing day - major findings are discussed 
- They prepare a report and submit it to BC India and they decide if the license will be continued or not. Types of licenses - Compliance with observation (means farmers may have knowledge but adoption is less - so they will give chance to see if there is any growth happening) 
- 64 Indicators under BCI - non-compliance with any one of the indicators - license is lost. 
- Licensing done once in three years. INTL 23 is pending for licensing this year. INTL 01 and 02 got licenses in the last 2 years.

Sindhu (INTL 01) 	Licensing is provided once every 3 years.
3rd Party Verifications are conducted with random farmers every 3 years.
Internal Verification occurs yearly; Secondary Verification in the 2nd year; 3rd Party Verification in the 3rd year.
The sampling process involves random sampling, with an increase in sample size if mismatches occur.
Credibility of collected data is maintained through cross-checks at multiple levels: 100% by Assistant PUM, 10-20% by PUM, and 5-10% by Coordinator.
Final approval of project plans is done by WWF after feedback and discussion.
Villages Adoption: Driven by shifts in crop patterns due to monsoon influences.

Funding Pattern: WWF → Navakranti FPCL → FPO.
	PU Manager (Sindhu)
Oversees 97 Learning Groups (LGs) and 48 villages (INTL01).
Participates in farmer trainings, staff reviews, data compilation, and activity plans.
Responsible for capacity strengthening training as per BC module.
Updates data onto Excel sheets.

Assistant PU Manager
Monitors daily activities, inspections, and challenges from Field Facilitators (FF).
Cross-checks data collected by FF (100%).

Field Facilitators (FF)
Collect data on farmers, adoption, soil sampling, PRA (village wells, ponds, agricultural lands).
Cross-check data with RIR templates provided by BC.

Training: Up to 2 trainings per month on the 6 Principles; Livelihood program integration slow due to work and financial burdens.
Review: Monthly reviews, bi-weekly during peak seasons.	Data Cross-checking: Cross-checked by Asst PUM (100%), PUM (10-20%), and Coordinator (5-10%).
Error Percentage: 5% max, mostly in Farmers List (Land Acreage, etc.).
Data Discrepancy: Largely due to mistrust of farmers; the data is largely credible.	Process: Random sampling, increased sample size if mismatches are found, data rechecked.
Time Consumption: High for RIR due to a 10% sample size; templates are simplified for FF.	High: Due to systematic sampling, multiple levels of cross-checking, and credibility checks.	Sindhu - PUM INTL01	Processes under MEL: 
- Cross checking: For each document there is a % which she cross checks. From each FF, 10 to 20% data is considered. So say if an FF has 4 villages under her - from each village 10% is considered and that sample is called and cross checked. 
- Each list / document is cross checked 10-20% (if the population is high) and 5 to 10% (if population is low) 
- This % was fixed internally by WWF. 
- APUM cross checks 40 to 50% 
- Project coordinator checks 3 to 5% 
- As per her, this process is reliable. If she finds any issues - she again tells the FF to cross check - so the process is very reliable. 
- Data is collected in google sheets, hard copies. Every document has a hardcopy - little difficult to manage but major data on google sheets. 

Management strategies: 
- We have a monitoring sheet with us when we go on field, she notes down in the sheet. 
- She also carries her diary and makes notes of suggestions, etc. We also come back and discuss with KVKs. 
- There is a whatsapp group of FFs + KVKs - so if FFs are unable to answer anything, they step in and answer. 
- Whatsapp group of only FFs + Sindhu 
- Whatsapp group with farmers 
- Village wise whatsapp group also 
- They put weather forecast info also 
- These groups also help farmers who have missed training to come to speed 

Factors that driver her: Her parents were farmers, she is interested in this and has a degree as well in soil science. 

Number of lists: Soil health (soil organic carbon, etc. is analyzed, we cross check if decreased or increased) &gt; Early season estimates (farmers list) &gt; well monitoring&gt; Demos are planned &gt; PRA data &gt; Activity / monitoring plan &gt; adoption plan &gt; FFBs &gt; RIR (post harvest estimates) 
What is the Farmers list approach? LGs, farmer codes for individual farmers, co farmers, irrigation data  etc. (for responsibilities wrt each list see detailed transcript)

How is the sample collected? 
- APUM - 40 to 50% of type of data, PUM - 10%, Satish sir - 3 to 5% 
- Demos are held based on seasons - for eg. sowing then spraying and Rallies (staff and villagers walking together with placards) are held in sept - august - for eg. not to use highly chemical pesticides, use PPE Kits, etc. - this way even Non - BC farmers get educated. 

Time spent on MEL work - Season wise lists are prepared - so her work also varies accordingly. Currently time for farmers list so her 1-2 weeks goes in that. After that some other data set.
Nikita (INTL 23) 	MEL approach &amp; its implementation on ground 
- Activity plan main thing &gt;&gt; CS at FF level cascaded to farmer level 
- After farmer trainings &gt; adoption data collected 
- Analysis done based on past years data points and current year 
- Based on the findings, we will suggest / improve trainings  

Roles and responsibilities
- Nikita prepares 15 day timeline for FFs and keeps them aware of  the deadline 
- Review with FF every 15 day - meeting
	Different types of data collected:
- For every training / activity we do we maintain documents even if not mandated by BC 
- For eg., for farmers list we have an internal template (non BCI) - after all the cleaning it is copy pasted in the BC template 
- RIR 
- Adoption data 
- Continuous improvement plan / time bound plan - for few activities 100% adoption is not there by farmers (eg. PPE kit) such critical activities we take under the improvement plan and then we ensure that the adoption increases to 100% in the next three years. Max 10 such activities and minimum 5 such activities
 
For detailed MEL activities see Transcript 

Support provided by BC for monitoring: 
- Online training given on RIR - - how to collect data, etc. 
- Even Satish sir gives training in local language
	- Data is collected in timely manner 
- Quality control protocol &gt;&gt; APUM checks 20 to 30% PUM checks 10 to 20% &amp; PC 3 to 5% &gt;&gt; this is applicable to any data set 
- Steps taken to rectify errors &gt;&gt; If any mismatches are found in first round of 10%, (more than 2)  PUM checks for another 10% - if mistake found there also then entire data set sent back to FF for refilling / cross checking 
- Challenges: no big issue. Just sometimes farmers may give different answers so in that case we ask the farmers itself if their land size (for eg) has changed, compared to previous year 
- Farmers are cooperative with PUM / FF - we dont tell them it is wrong we just ask them the question again.
	- For every village there is a lead farmer + random picking from LG . Instead of calling we also go and talk to them. (PUM asks Lead farmer of that LG on pesticide data, or other data) 
- It does represent the entire population since if we combine the PUM, APUM, PC - majority of the data is cross checked. 
- Farmers that are chosen by APUM are different, in the sense, PUM choose different set of farmers, PC chooses different. 
- Eg. There are 97 farmers under one LG then they will choose 10% of that LG = 9.7 (10) &gt;&gt; 9 farmers + 1 lead farmer.
- Challenges in doing sampling: no challenges as such
	MEL model being representative of farmers: Yes it is representative

Do you think the MEL systems are efficient? 
10% is currently done, for the errors to lessen it would be better if we considered 20 to 30% . Due to heavy documentation work it becomes difficult. 	https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a59FNTY_HeADS838yND25HNdLn6oGWzsFVTv8nD1Mfo/edit	Nikita handles a variety of data critical to the success of her projects:

1. Annual Planning Data: This includes developing time-bound plans based on key issues collected by Field Facilitators (FFs). Each year, she prepares an activity plan and a monitoring plan.

2. Soil Sample Testing: After FFs compile soil testing data, Nikita inputs it into a prescribed BC format and shares it with the project coordinator.

3. Monthly Action Plans for FFs: She manages and reviews the action plans that outline monthly activities for FFs.

4. Pesticide Lists: She maintains a list of locally used pesticides.

5. Disadvantage List: Identifies physically handicapped individuals for livelihood support and collaborates with government schemes.

6. Degraded Lands Identification: Manages data on degraded lands, including identification and restoration plans.

7. FFB Updation: Routine updates of the FFB

8. Adoption and RIR Data: Manages data related to adoption of practices and the Results Indicator Report (RIR).

Data Management Process:

Nikita manages data seasonally, distributing hard copies to FFs who use internal WWF Excel templates and Google Sheets for data entry. FFs collect data from farmers and submit it to Nikita, she then verifies the information through calls or in-person visits to resolve any issues. The APUM also reviews the data before it is forwarded to Nikita and then to the project coordinator. This structured process ensures that data is consistently updated and accurately maintained

Farmers List Management:

Nikita oversees the annual updating of the farmers' list, which involves FFs visiting villages to identify and enroll cotton-growing farmers. Each year, FFs update the list to remove farmers who no longer grow cotton and add new farmers. This process ensures that the data remains current and relevant.

Data Quality and Integrity:

To maintain data quality, Nikita cross-checks the data by randomly selecting 10% of farmers for verification. Any discrepancies found lead to a thorough review of the entire data set by the FF. The APUM also contributes by cross-checking and occasionally entering data. Nikita ensures that 10% of data from each village is reviewed, while the APUM checks 20-30% and the project coordinator audits 3-5%. This multi-tiered approach to data quality and integrity supports the accuracy and reliability of the information collected.

Participant 	Overview of the MEL approach	Implementation of the MEL system	Quality Assurance	Sampling 	Level of confidence in MEL results	Transcript 
Sonal Dhingra - MEL 	We have split data into two categories - 
- Reach data (area, number of farmers &amp; production) - for each PU we get reach data 
- RIR - Result Indicators Report - sample of farmers taken from each PU and we try to understand -  what was the water use, pesticide use (bio vs chemicals) 
- Sonal majorly deals with RIR data 
What is her role? / activities 
- Sonal is the senior coordinator - global MEL - she works with one more coordinator who looks after reach (Phelix). Shannon - boss of both.  
- We receive this data 12 weeks after the harvest - Sonal does gap analysis (basic completeness check, data validity - eg, area irrigated cannot be higher than area under cultivation, if all active ingredients of a pesticide are listed in the data or not, etc.) - whatever is possible  
- If data is not ok - we reach out to partners 
- Data is recorded in a particular format - from FFB to RIR - the data is not transferred without issues. - so gap analysis helps. 
- After this basic check, we do outlier check - we compare PUs average with the farms average - in terms of yield, if a PUs yield is 135 kg per ha but for a particular farm it is 1000 kg per ha - then we question the data 
- Sometimes it is an error and sometimes it is a genuine issue 
- So there is a lot of back and forth between country MEL, global MEL, partners 
- Farmer level - FFB &gt; FF &gt; PUM + MEL person at partner level &gt; RIR 
- Hidden layer  between FFB and PUM - partners maintain an internal excel which is easy - they agg values and they input the values in the RIR 
- Mostly PUMs fill the RIR with help of FFs or MEL person at partner level
	Set of Activities under MEL (done by Sonal) 
- Gap analysis
- Outlier check (PU’s average with farmer average is compared - involves lot of back and forth - this is a very big issue as it delays sending data further)
- Data updation on Cotton Cloud (database) - Power BI DB 
 
Reporting requirements that Better Cotton MEL mandates from the PU:
- Reach data - broken down in multiple parts - you also get in early season estimates - farmers who are expected to grow cotton this year, etc. we update this figure in terms of area, production, and final number of farmers who are growing cotton (late estimate data) . 
- Then post harvest data - it will come at the same time as RIR 
- RIR data - Main three sheets - area &amp; production, fertilizer use, pesticide use and three more sheets -
- Number of training that happens in the entire season (description, training, duration, attendance, etc.) training is further divided into farmers and workers. 
- Contextual information: we introduced it three years back - questions at PU level - was the water level higher than last year, costs higher than last year, etc. 
- These three sheets help us answer reasons for some outlier 

Support provided by the Better Cotton team to the WWF in the successful completion of the monitoring process
- Dashboards are something that partners are using data quality - how much chemicals / pesticides they have used, income variation across seasons, 
- We are talking with partners regularly and the MEL team trying to collab with partners directly, understanding pain points from partners - RIR
	Are all the types of data collected and reported in a timely manner? If not, what are the reasons for delays? 
- no major delays from Partner (deadline is 3 months after the harvest) they report diligently - but when we get back with clarifications it takes time for them to revert. 
- Deadline for actual sharing of RIR - i have not seen any delays

What are the steps taken to rectify errors found in data collection and entry?
- Yield for alot of farmers is the same in a PU - sampled farmers say 200 -&gt; 100 end up having the same yield. how can that be possible ? - they must be guesstimating - but sometimes there are genuine reasons as all farmers are close by - same climatic conditions, same pest attacks, etc. 
- Farmers usually know their land size in bigha and BC asks for land size in ha, so sometimes the numbers are lost in translation.
- Farmers should be seeing sale receipts - small farmers dont have weighing machines - they dont know how much they have produced and sold. FFs should check the sale receipt. We are trying to put this in the minds of PUMs / FF

What are the challenges encountered by the BC team when data is received from the ground (from partners/country or MEL team)? 
- Timeliness in terms of clarification is a big issue we face. The first set of data they give is timely but when we ask for clarification it takes alot of time and we are frozen. So we are very dependent on partners answers,
- Unit conversion (from bigha to acres to ha as BC demand data in ha) difference in units compared with BC and what is followed region wise - is an issue , 
- Fertilizer - we ask them how much kilogram is used - but since they are small farmers, they report in ML - unit is a big issue.  
Sonal deals with multiple countries so it is even more challenging as farm size categorisation is different across countries. 


	Lot of changes have happened - because of COVID and methodology based changes 
Two types of farmers - BC farmers + Lead farmers (every LG has one) 
Before COVID - 
- we used to sample using 95% CI and 5% MoE - say there are 3500 farmers per PU - we used to ask for 500 to 600 farmers (can be between 350 to 600) - this includes all the lead farmers (100 to 125) + BC farmers 
- Methodology - 100 LGs for any PU - randomly select 10 LGs (country team selects) and pick up all farmers in that LG (35 farmers each LG) - 350 - remaining 90 LGs where lead farmers are selected. 
- Was it representative? Our unit of analysis - LG - LGs were formed to ensure smooth training purposes .. farmers were randomly selected but the lead farmers were not random - so you can say this was a flaw .. at one point we were comparing lead farmers with BC farmers.. We used to also compare BC farmers with comparison farmers of the same PU. 
- Despite all this we were not reporting on lead farmers outside.. (since it was not random sample).. We were reporting on BC farmers versus comparison farmers (non BC farmers) 
Post COVID 
- 95% , 10% - 200 farmers per PU - out of 200 = 100 lead farmers + 100 BC farmers  - mandate to collect lead farmers did not change. 
- 100 BC / lead farmers Farmers - methodology - randomly selected 10 LGs out of which 9 BC farmers randomly selected each LG = 90 BC farmers + 1 Lead farmer from each LG from remaining LGs &gt;&gt;&gt; 200. 
- FFB - 5 farmers each LG since feedback received that a lot of time of FF going behind FFB. Therefore changed to support only 5 farmers per LG. 
- Before COVID all farmers under LG were selected later only few 
- Now I  am more confident in the methodology, it is representative. (PURE) 
- Any suggestions: Lead farmer selection should have been scrapped - 
	For rating of confidence in MEL results see Transcript

Means of Verification: MEL team is not well resourced to do those kind of verifications (Rating: ⅔) - lot of scope for improvement. 
Country workshops are being held - better collabs with partners which will help us better connect with partners.

Participant 	Role of Robin	Understanding of Supply Chain 	Process followed in BC 	Risks to credibility - segregation (BC vs non BC cotton) 	Process of Traceability 	Risks in traceability	Demand supply situation in TN 	Challenges reported by Ginner or other staff 	Actual credible uptake meet the AAV for each PU	Credibility challenges by value chain players	Transcript 
Robin - Supply Chain 	- Robin has been working in BC for 2 and a half years as a _____  - within BC he is responsible for taking care of audits, reviewing reports, capacity building, etc. 
- He is working with the ginner to retailers and brands. 
Following are his main activities: 
- Capacity building - Ginner CB program in august and sept - CB takes place on Chain of Custody standards, which all suppliers (ginner to end manufacturer) need to comply with. 
- Monitoring and audits - His focus is on ginner part - answering their queries on the BC platform. - any queries like technical issues he provides support	- Ginner &gt; trader &gt; spinner &gt; yarn &gt; fabric and then brands - it is not a one step process. 
- We do not give any costing on the BC portal. Since we are non - profits - it is the seller and buyers call. 
- Qty received is captured 
- Ginner captures the qty purchased on the BC platform - from xx PU we have procured this xx quantity, code name is specified, AV code, reference of procurement docs (suppose 100 slips involved in procurement from that PU - we need to mention the purchase slip number) 
- Once they put on the portal it enters into the BC supply chain. 
- Risks - we are representing 2-3k farmers through one AV code only. So on the portal we don't have mapping at farmer level, only at PU level. 
- If spinner not giving order to ginner for the procured BC cotton - 
- Say if spinner buys from ginner - then ginner will enter a sales transaction - they will specify buyer name, qty, invoice and other commercial invoices 
- Suppose if ginner is not able to sell BC and he sells it elsewhere - then does not appear in the BC value chain. 
- We are aware that all BC produced cotton will not enter our supply chain. 
- So therefore, in the portal we know only about qty sold and bought. No prices are mentioned.
	- We are not into certification, we don't give ginners any certificates. 
- Process - at the beginning of every cotton season - we start the onboarding training and every ginner has to go through it. We invite the old ginners plus new ones who have shown interest - training takes place full day. It is a mandatory process and if they dont attend they are not enrolled on the BC platform. Instead of a certificate you can say that we give them access to the BC platform. Every ginner will have a code. We don't charge anything from the ginner. 
- We onboard ginners in and around the PU villages, within a 50 to 100 km area. - basically near a farmer. 
- Time for transportation depends on distance between ginner and farmers 
- Demand for cotton has been very low since last year due to international scenario 
No. of ginners working with BC: 
- Every year at the end of Aug every registration is null and void - every year we start from scratch - for the last 2-3 seasons 250 to 270 ginners have been working with us (all the PUs across India). In TN, we have 40 to 50 ginners. Lesser no. in TN as required - it is higher in MH, PB, etc.

Farmers are free to sell with BC registered Ginner or outside, up to them. Factors like cost, immediate payment to farmers-  influences farmers to choose ginner. 	- CoC specifies that ginners have to keep BC cotton separate from conventional cotton.
- During the training we tell them ginners have to maintain separate heaps - some marking has to be there. 
- For quality purpose - we are not caring of the quality as that is commercial discussion - we care only about the segregation 
- How are you ensuring that ginner is segregating? / verification systems: We have an assurance program / third party audits for registered ginners- we have a specific sample - at least 30% of all India ginner verification takes place. 
- CoC is very comprehensive - we have third party assurance 
- Jammikunta ginner mentioned that he does not segregate the cotton - Robin’s reply - if ginner is not able to procure then he cannot list it on the portal. It is not mandatory for the ginner to supply through the portal. 
- We also visit ginners regularly. Ginners are active during the start of September and end in march. 
	- Through sales and purchase docs - every Ginner has to have record at farmer level 
- Every farmer has a different code 
- Ginners have to maintain the following data  - Mode of transportation, qty purchased, directly purchased or through middlemen (if middlemen all his info) 
- Transportation data is also captured - vehicle no., etc - supporting docs are also maintained - 
purchase slips (farmer details, etc.), 
quantity slip and 
transportation doc if the transportation is done by the ginner. (there is no uniform transp method, sometimes middlemen collects from 10 farmers and sometimes ginner also sends transportation to farmer) 
- Are these docs sufficient as per you ? - The farmer to gin transaction is unorganized. For eg. B2BCI - limited docs from the actors, all dealings happen in cash, therefore the docs we ask for are sufficient. We are working on some pilots in this regard - but I am not part of it. 
- Risks - sometimes ginners cannot send two vehicles for BC and non BC - we mention in training that separate trucks have to be sent.. 
- We check the size of vehicles during our assessment and the quantity they bring there. Vehicle no. of all BC farmers we will check if the same. 
- We tell them not to mix BC and non BC - since quality is the utmost imp. 
- Purchase slips are also given to farmers 
- We check these slips during verification
	There are risks. 
Non BC farmers - sometimes in heap of BC cotton - conventional cotton is mixed.
	- Overall demand bit low since last two years 
- Since cotton is an export based community 
- With respect to TN, feedback received is that the quality of the cotton is low - length of the fiber, maturity of the fiber, gin outturn (suppose - I put 100 kg of seed cotton - how much lint and how much seed - out of 100 kg 37/36 kg lint cotton but in TN the recovery is lower. 
- We are getting feedback that a lot of cotton is being transported from TN to the neighboring states, where quality of cotton is better - middlemen doing this to optimize the costs. 
	- Pricing - ginners are saying BC farmers are asking more cost even though we are not getting any profit here. Cotton prices are driven by the market 
- Esp in TN, ginner is saying we are not getting enough info on farmers. Gap between ginner and farmer - struggling in farmer identity. 
	Uptake never as per AAV (always less) - not practical as well.	We have no physical traceability - we are not claiming that the garment is of BC 
But at the ginner side we have traceability 
2 types of CoC model - Physical and mass balance (mb) - from gin to upward actors it is physical and mb. 
After the ginner, we are having a system of BCCU (BC Claim Unit- 1 BCCU = 1 kg of lint cotton) . If 100 kg lint cotton is sold from ginner to spinner then 100 BCCU will appear in the spinner's account. That 100 BCCU can be used by spinner for any cotton. &gt;&gt; this is mb.
This mb points can be used by the spinner without selling the actual cotton 
In mb there is a requirement of physical transaction then only points will be transferred to spinner account. 
During audits, we try to get the sense if points have been transferred without actual physical transfer - we track this. 
In the physical method - cotton has to be segregated at all steps of VC - but there is a risk of mixing. This method we have introduced last year - we use both methods of mb and physical.

	Compliance to credibility
	Sampling	Level of confidence in assurance results	Link to transcript 
Lalit Sharma 	Assurance approach (to understand if PUs are complying to BC standards or not - includes lists etc.) 
- It differs between the PU - licensing for old vs new 
- Partners conduct internal assessment of PU before BC licensing 
- Old PUs - assessment visit, license for three years, whenever it is getting expired BC will do it. 
- Surveillance assessment is for those who have an active license - incase there is any change in farmer participation or if there is any red flag raised in previous visits - then this assessment is conducted. 
- Assurance activities are mostly time bound 
- Assurance is an umbrella term - licensing is just a part of it. Even assessment comes under it like data verification, etc.

Assessment process (Assurance is the umbrella term and assessment is a part of it)
- There are principles and criteria in place which have some indicators in them
- PUs have to comply to these principles 
- Assurance team comprises - 2 sets of assessors (BC + third party verifiers) - 4 organizations currently empanelled as TPV. People like lalit who do assessment - 4 to 5 people 
- PUs are intimated one week in advance - a template is shared with them which outlines the requirements. There are some docs also which are required to be submitted by PU before the assessment - we give them three days to give it to us.
	Role of Lalit : 
- He has joined BC 4 years ago and is  working as Assurance Cooridnator &gt;&gt; he has a reporting manager 
- He is involved in - Assurance activities: 
- Data management (farmers list, adjusted figures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data)  
- Assurance activities calendar preparation  (licensing, etc.) 
- Training of PUMs / FFs on various lists
- Purpose of assurance - whether PUs are complying to standards or not. Within assurance we have different compliances (like list) + assessment conducted every three years. Assurance activities are defined set of requirement for eg. data - early season data, adjusted figures after one month of sowing, farm level data, self assessment, etc. 
- Before the start of the season we approach program partners to ask them about sowing dates, harvesting - based on these dates we decide the calendar activity for PUs 
- Lalit gets data in separate files as per INTL
Expectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors: 
- Requirements to partners made clear 
- We plan our activities in advance so that partners are aware of when to submit 
- We also ensure that data from the field is of good quality - we thoroughly investigate it. 
- All communication from our end should be on time so that PCs have time to complete on time. 
Role of BC staff &amp; TPV same - 3 day exercise 
- 1st day: opening meeting - PUs give introduction / PPT - interview with staff members, During this meeting, they also inform the villages that the team will be visiting the next day
- 2nd day: 2 LGs are covered - 5 farmers from each LG minimum - farmers + workers are interviewed. On this day we tell them about the next day's villages. 
- 3rd day: Morning - 1 LG - 5 farmers meeting - Post lunch: closing remarks / meeting. We dont give any recommendations or idea of how the PU is doing - all that goes in the report. 
- After this - we make a report and submit it to the India Assurance Team and also to the global assurance team. Licensing is in their hands. 
- BC staff and TPV visits separately to separate PUs - we have a ratio of 60:40 - 60% assessment will be done by TPV and 40% by BC. 
- Assessment process same as above 
- There is flexibility in conducting the interviews - more than 3 LGs can also be interviewed - minimum is 3 
- TPV also has to submit a report to India Assurance Team
Support provided by BC to TPV and WWF 
- CS vertical - Relationship management team - in touch with WWF Telangana - we provide the standard protocol to the partners - it is up to them how they want to design the meetings / training calendar -they just have to comply with the principles. Incase PC wants any clarification or want to access a knowledge partner then BC conducts TOT. 
- We have separate templates for different data sets - we train the PUMs and PCs on how to fill this template - since RIR is technical. 
	Integrity of Data: 
- Earlier we had encountered the issue of fake farmers - when we receive the list of farmers from PU we cross check by calling a few farmers and asking them if they know they are a part of the BC program. 
- We have details of PU Staff - who are responsible for particular LGs - we call at least 5-10 farmers under each FF (non lead farmers since they are reliable) 
- Random selection of 5-10 farmers - we used to ask their names, father names, whether they know BC program 
- Right now they dont do this calling exercise - we have told partners that we can do this cross check anytime 
- Processes followed currently - whenever they receive a file they look from quality POV - correct format, units, duplication, etc. 
- For different data sets we have different cleaning exercises. For eg. RIR is checked by the global team. We just glance and check for basic things and follow the global team - they do a deep dive 
Factors considered for credibility in assessment process 
- Process are designed in a way that is impartial 
- It is recommended to assessors not to give suggestions to PUs during their visits 
- Anti bribery policy - no gifts to be considered from PUs 
Risks considered 
- When we used to inform PU about the assessment dates they used to revert saying there is xx festival - so we have asked partners to share dates with us 
- Recently 1 PU told us that there is some staffing issue and all the FFs had got terminated so they asked for time extension - sometimes even PUM not well etc. - so if particular staff is not available we assess how crucial they are for our assessment - if not very crucial then we are ok and continue with the assessment 
- Weather issues - farmers are not in mood to talk when weather is not good 
Efficiency in assurance process 
- Approach is good enough 
- We have an arm for CS also which is unique to BC 
- We have a whole picture in the three day assessment - at the end of the day we want to understand the impact 
- We only talk to 15 farmers but this is good to get an idea - as general practices are same across LGs 
Factors contributing to non compliance from farmers 
- Adoption of PPE kit - we want farmers to use them but weather conditions are such they dont wear 
- Sometimes extension agents (pesticide vendors) tell farmers to mix chemicals 
- Certain chemicals BC bans but it is cheap and easily available to farmers so they opt for it (for eg. monocrotophos) 
- We have run campaigns to discourage such behavior
How do the existing assurance systems and processes work to mitigate the risks/ influence associated with free riders and non-BC farmers?
This will remain a challenge - we dont have details of ALL farmers since we dont have resources for that. Even in the PURE we cant say there wont be free riders 


	- In the limited time we have (3 days) - 15 farmers is fair - but we also do FGDs to cross check 
- Sample size is fixed for us - 15 - random sampling 
- We also talk to local resources - pesticides shop owner, sarpanch, etc. 
- Therefore , 15 farmers + FGDs + local resources is good enough 
- We are well versed on how to talk to farmers and we are also well versed with the geography - makes our job easier 
- He feels the sample size is representative - sampling is done on our own as in the LG selection is on us. We do it on following factors - based on rain fed farmers, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, response of FF in opening meeting 
- Selection bias prevention - Assessors select the LGs 
- Respondent bias prevention - we are as objective as possible 
- Scope of the assessment (duration and sample) limit the assessors’ ability 
In case we feel that three LGs is not enough or if something is inconclusive - we are free to consider 4 or 5 LGs 
- Challenges in assurance process 
- Nothing as such - just the risks i mentioned above
- Remote locations - traveling becomes too far - even between LG farmers 
	- Means of verification used to validate/triangulate the findings - FGDs + local resource information

Aarepally (INTL 01) 	- The farmers have been a part of BC from 6 years 
- All the cotton farmers in this GP are BC farmers = Out of 200 farmers in GP / 150 growing cotton (others grow rice), out of 150 &gt;&gt; 130 are BC farmers, within which there are only 2-3 women farmers (they joined because their husbands died recently). The women participate in training, etc. 
- Average land size of farmers = 2 to 5 acres (max: 10 acres) Farmers with less agri land take land on lease 
- Non-program farmers have a particular mindset and they don't want to join ANY program
- Earlier farmers used to end up investing higher amounts and used to get less yield. Now their investments have decreased and are getting better yield - they now use organic fertilizers and cow / buffalo dung. 
- Previously, when Mr. Raghuveera Reddy was the Agricultural Minister of the former Andhra Pradesh state, he provided a subsidy on fertilizers. The original cost of a bag of seed was Rs. 1,750, but with the subsidy, they were able to purchase it for Rs. 750.
	- Farmers like AVs and find it helpful : They feel that videos are the best medium for learning 
- FFs conduct training as per farmer convenience  (morning 7AM to 9AM) 
- Farmers who joined the BC program late - joined by seeing the progress of BC farmers - less pesticides, rallies, AVs, etc. 
- Farmers fill FFB diligently, they like it and feel it is useful. For illiterate farmers, FF helps + also farmers children 
- When asked on the challenges, farmers said they haven't faced any issue.  
- Due to the rallies, co farmers and other non program farmers too have become keen on being part of BC 
- The FF- Sony - does regular follow up with BCI farmers through farm visits, home visits. Farmers also call her up and ask doubts. 
- Women also participate in rallies, though about 10% of female farmers are unable to attend. Not all women gather on a single platform; instead, they split into different groups based on their areas and attend various meetings. The 10 women farmers who missed the rallies will be reached through Self Help Group meetings and FF does home visits.
	- Previously, they were using Monocrotophos and spending a significant amount on pesticides, often following a cocktail of chemicals, but with very poor crop yields. However, thanks to the guidance from Ms. Sony and the field staff, they learned not to use harmful pesticides or chemical mixtures. 
- As a result, their costs have decreased, and our crop yields have significantly improved, leading to better prices in the market. In the past, farmers were incurring losses, but now, with the regular support and information from Ms. Damayanthi and Ms. Sony, they have conducted soil tests, 
- We also started planting intercropped green grams and black grams, and began using domestically produced organic fertilizers, such as those made from neem trees.
- Previously, no one guided us on these practices. Now, due to the impact of field visits and meetings, they are using fewer pesticides, cultivating intercropped crops, and protecting our health.
- They face menace from Monkeys - monkeys target crops like Tomato and Brinjal - making it difficult for the farmers to do intercropping 
- Farmers told that their quality of life has increased after becoming part of BC - purchased chairs at home, educated their children, converted their Kaccha houses to Pakka houses 
- They get Rs. 20k profit per acre per season 
	- BC farmers mentioned that their wives also help in farming 
- They do not take help from children as it affects their education. The farmers also said that it is risk to take them to field as if a snake bit or scorpion bite happens then they cant identify it and it can become fatal 
	- The average income from one acre of land - Rs. 20,000 - 6 months and if two crops then Rs. 40,000 (12 months)	All families in the village belonged to backward class. There is only one upper caste in the village and they are not into farming. 
However, there is no community system now and we dont differentiate between religions.

Chityalapally (INTL 23) 	The farmers have been cultivating different crops including Maize, grams etc since 30+years but have transitioned to cultivating cotton from the last 12 years. The BC program have been operating in the area since 6 years.
Lead Farmer - Mallesh, has been involved for many years.
The farmers carry their cotton to the market yard, where they receive a higher price compared to selling to private agents. But some of the farmers transacts with private agents even as the transport responsibility and expenses are taken care by them.
	Theres a 50% attendance ratio for trainings.
Trainings cover topics including the proper use of fertilizers, soil testing, the importance of wearing PPE kits, and avoiding harmful pesticides .
Some farmers do not consistently use PPE kits, leading to health issues. 
FFB is not maintained by and large, although a very few is said to have noting down the important expenses.
Audio and video demonstrations by private companies are demonstrated on the use of their products. 	Reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals and increased adoption of safer practices like using green color pesticides instead of red .
Machinery usage has increased, reducing the need for manual labor. This includes the use of tractors, harvesting machines, and even cotton-removing machines .
The shift from cotton to paddy is noted due to the lower labor requirements for paddy and improved water resources .	Female farmers rarely attend the meetings due to their domestic and agricultural responsibilities
Decision-making within families is predominantly done by male farmers, though feedback from educated females is sometimes accepted - BC trainings has helped the female farmers in gaining the knowledge and hence, better decision making roles (&quot;If the females are educated, we will accept female feedback&quot;)	Income Generated: Rs. 7000 per quintal, with yields of 10-12 quintals per acre . They also earn income from intercropping with maize, green grams, and groundnut .

The use of private markets and government market yards affects their earnings, with government yards offering higher prices but involving more effort in transportation .
	No major role was discussed on Caste operations - though all of them were from OCs	Farmers suggest that the duration of meetings should be reduced to 45 minutes, as the current one-hour meetings are considered too long .
There is a need for free PPE kits, as the cost of Rs. 1000 per kit is burdensome for farmers. 
They also requested fixed prices for pesticides and fertilizers across outlets to avoid losses .
Farmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training tools and better safety materials .
There is a general satisfaction with the BCI program, but they pointed out that some farmers still do not follow all recommended practices, such as wearing PPE kits .

Srikant (INTL 02) 	- He has been with BC from 2 years and has been the lead farmer since 1 ½ years 
- He owns 2.5 acres of land 
- 15 farmers under him , 200 cotton farmers in the village
- In the village, maximum 5 acres of land and minimum 1 acre of land. 
- Cotton and paddy are the most grown crops in his village, other crop: chilly and maize. 
	- Educating farmers on bio pesticides (green, blue), stem applications, usage of PPE kits, intercropping, pest management, border crops. 
- Srikant explains to his fellow farmers the following things - 
- The use of certain pesticides led to losses, so he explained the system to others, emphasizing the importance of using only green and blue pesticides. 
- He advised against using Monocrotophos. 
- He is educating farmers about precautions related to water resources, promoting the use of bio-fertilizers, and advising them to avoid harmful pesticides. 
- He also taught farmers a crop watering method - it involves watering alternate rows of plants (There are four plant rows: 1, 2, 3, and 4. On the first day, he waters rows 1 and 3. On the second day, he waters rows 2 and 4) 
- What he learns from the Farmer Facilitator (FF), he shares with the field farmers. FF has taught him about intercropping with red gram and green gram, usage of PPE Kits, and border crops. 
	- He became the lead farmer because he was more educated compared to other farmers in the village. 
- He also said that initially investments were high with pesticides and fertilizers, now after becoming part of BC his investments have reduced and he wants to educate the other farmers too.
	- He said that he is not aware of demos, rallies, exposure visits, etc. Since this village recently came under the fold of BCI - they have planned for rallies, demos, etc. after July 15 2024. He said that few trainings have been conducted 
- Srikant also mentioned that other farmers listen to him and few farmers who cannot attend trainings come for other trainings which are held at their convenient timings. 
	- Srikant maintains FFB and fills it on the same day. He helps other farmers fill in too. 
- He said he likes filling FFB, he does not face any challenges and also feels that it is important. 
- When asked about how maintaining FFB helped him - he said it helps them track their income, expenditure, profit and loss. 	- FF told farmers in training about cotton storage - no dust, no water contact, etc. 
- Srikant preserves the cotton in a clean, dry place by following proper precautions. He ensures the cotton is free of dust by tying it in cloth and avoiding exposure to water and humidity. Additionally, he dries the cotton thoroughly and stores it in good-quality bags to maintain its condition.
- Srikant has 18 quintals of cotton which he has stored for the past one year - the day this interview was held he had sent out 8 quintals of cotton for sale at Rs. 12,000 per quintal. He was waiting for the prices to increase. One ginner (market yard commission agent) approached Srikant and gave him cash and receipt and took his cotton. 
- The commission agent will take 1.5% commission if farmer wants immediate cash but if farmer is ok with receiving money after 15 days then no commission is levied.
- For transportation, most of the farmers use truck (rented) - expense is around Rs. 1,200
- Price of cotton depends on its quality. 
	- Srikant talks to other non-BC farmers about BC but only to those who are near him 
- He also said that other farmers are reluctant to join BC because they feel they will have to attend lot of trainings and do documentation 
- Farmers discuss practices amongst themselves
	- He said that post BC, yield per acre has increased. Before also yield was good , the difference post BC has been that first he used to grow only cotton throughout the year - now he grows cotton and maize and yellow gram as a border crop. 
- Crop yield increased per acre
	Subsidy for seeds, new agricultural methods, labor problem is there, therefore machinery equipment to cut cotton flowers. 	- 20 laborers working on his farm - Female Rs 500 per day and male Rs. 800 to 1000 per day because they do more laborious work. During the season the rates may be higher. 
- Male farmers are usually involved in laborious work while women are involved in weeding and cotton plucking.	- Srikant said that avoidance of pesticides has benefitted them as quality of cotton has increased and investment has reduced.
- In his initial months, Srikant used to motivate non-BCI farmers to join the the BC program. 
- Srikant himself wears a scarf to cover his head but he does not wear shoes because the land is very marshy.
- Srinkant buys seeds from private fertilizer shops - Sidda and Randhir - Rs. 750 to 800 for 450 gms which suffices for 0.5 acres of land. He also said WWF provides with navadhanya to promote regenerative agriculture 
- Srikant doesn't want his children to do farming. He said when he was young he started farming and could not study further. 
- Youth of the village get either private or govt. Jobs with a minimum 10,000 salary.

Ramesh (INTL 23)	Ramesh has been associated with BC since 6 years &amp; has 40 farmers under him,  only 2 to 3 are women. Ramesh was selected to become the lead farmer by KVK. 	- Conducting trainings, solving problems faced by farmers
- He gives official training to farmers once a month, if need be then more than once. But on an informal basis, Ramesh meets farmers everyday - they call him up and ask him for suggestions / advice 
- Topics covered - Intercropping (with red gram &amp; yellow gram), no usage of pesticides, use of organic methods, precautions while spraying pesticides, etc. 
Ramesh educates farmers on using pheromone traps, and the importance of wearing safety gloves and masks during spraying. The farmers follow his recommendations because he promotes good practices and suggests using effective medicines. As a result, the farmers end up adopting the practices.


	He said that he feels everyone should benefit from good / best farming practices. He believes that if he educates other farmers then their crop yield will be higher and costs will be lower. 
	- Most impactful aspect of training: Rallies have been conducted in the village, AVs have not been shown but he said that the distribution of pamphlets and putting Flexis during training proves to be very useful to the farmers. 
- Ramesh mentioned that non BC and non cotton growing farmers (paddy farmers) also participate in the meetings 
- Ramesh also believes that the duty of restoring the damage done to the environment is in our hands and therefore we should only fix it. 	Ramesh being the lead farmer maintains the FFB by writing all farm expenditures in it. Even the other farmers like maintaining the FFB as they feel it helps them capture / record everything. 	- Non BC farmers (growing maize, gram, etc.) also participate in the training and have shown interest in becoming part of the program. 
- Ramesh mentioned that farmers talk about agri practices as and when they meet - be it on the road, fertilizer shops or temples. 
- While some farmers are cooperative, there are some larger farmers who may not always listen. However, it was announced to all the cotton farmers that everyone would attend a meeting where cotton would be harvested as a competition. 
	Yields have increased plus we are now able to do intercropping of pulses. We use these pulses at home for meals which saves us on the cost of buying from the market. 
	- 50% of the village women farmers help in farming - providing water, planting seeds, removing weeds, plucking and helping in pesticide spraying 
- Men do tasks like ploughing and spraying pesticides - basically heavy physical work 
	Challenges: 
- Biggest problem is the pink bollworm which affects the quality of the cotton. Usage of pheromone traps has reduced the problem only a little. No medicine is available in the market against bollworm. 
- Fluctuating cotton prices are an issue 
- Govt. gives seeds of red gram and green gram free of cost - they haven't given it this time

Stakeholders for KPI 7 :  Ginner, BC Staff (Robin, Lalit, Sonal) 
Ginner 
Participant 	Role of Ginner	Procurement of Cotton	Mitigation of Risks to Credibility	Supply of Processed Cotton
Ginner - Narayanan Mukka - Jammikunta 	Operates in Jammikunta and has been in the cotton industry since 1997, started Ginning operations in 2002.
The ginning process involves unloading cotton, heating it for 24 hours, ginning (cleaning and separating fibers), and pressing into bales.
Ginners work with private spinning mills, mainly in Chennai and emerging markets like Gundoor in Telangana.
Ginning Mills in Jammikonda process approximately 1500 quintals of cotton per day.
Ginners have noticed that conventional and BC (Better Cotton ) cotton cannot be differentiated, and BCI certification is seen more as a negotiation tool.	Farmers participate in two ways: through the Government Market Yard (6 AM to 9 AM) or by bringing cotton directly to the ginner for mutual negotiation based on quality.
The average rate for cotton is 7500-7600 INR per 100 kg, with the highest this year being 7800 INR.
Cotton quality is tested after procurement, focusing on stability and micronaire.
Cotton is usually sold by farmers according to their convenience and financial needs rather than optimal storage or timing, leading to quality degradation with prolonged storage.	Farmers face challenges in cotton marketing and storage, as fiber quality decreases after 6-8 months of storage.
The Technology Mission of Cotton and mechanization (since 2008) have improved the ginning process, but issues like lack of farmer collectivization and the inefficacy of e-marketing platforms like GeM persist.
BCI certification isn’t widely adopted by farmers due to a lack of perceived necessity, though it could encourage better practices if more farmers were educated on its benefits.	Cotton is processed and then sold to private spinning mills, with no distinct identification mechanisms for cotton grown with chemicals or organically.
Bidding for cotton typically occurs through open tender, and quality remains 80% uniform for a specific delivery.
The yield per acre ranges from a minimum of 6 quintals to a maximum of 15 quintals, with the best quality cotton available from January to March, just before summer.

Robin - Supply Chain 	- Robin has been working in BC for 2 and a half years as a Supply Chain Coordinator  - within BC he is responsible for taking care of audits, reviewing reports, capacity building, etc. 
- He is working with the ginner to retailers and brands. 
Following are his main activities: 
- Capacity building - Ginner CB program in august and sept - CB takes place on Chain of Custody standards, which all suppliers (ginner to end manufacturer) need to comply with. 
- Monitoring and audits - His focus is on ginner part - answering their queries on the BC platform. - any queries like technical issues he provides support	- Ginner &gt; trader &gt; spinner &gt; yarn &gt; fabric and then brands - it is not a one step process. 
- We do not give any costing on the BC portal. Since we are non - profits - it is the seller and buyers call. 
- Qty received is captured 
- Ginner captures the qty purchased on the BC platform - from xx PU we have procured this xx quantity, code name is specified, AV (Annual Authorised Volume) code, reference of procurement docs (suppose 100 slips involved in procurement from that PU - we need to mention the purchase slip number) 
- Once they put on the portal it enters into the BC supply chain. 
- Risks - we are representing 2-3k farmers through one AV code only. So on the portal we don't have mapping at farmer level, only at PU level. 
- If spinner not giving order to ginner for the procured BC cotton - 
- Say if spinner buys from ginner - then ginner will enter a sales transaction - they will specify buyer name, qty, invoice and other commercial invoices 
- Suppose if ginner is not able to sell BC and he sells it elsewhere - then does not appear in the BC value chain. 
- We are aware that all BC produced cotton will not enter our supply chain. 
- So therefore, in the portal we know only about qty sold and bought. No prices are mentioned.
	- We are not into certification, we don't give ginners any certificates. 
- Process - at the beginning of every cotton season - we start the onboarding training and every ginner has to go through it. We invite the old ginners plus new ones who have shown interest - training takes place full day. It is a mandatory process and if they dont attend they are not enrolled on the BC platform. Instead of a certificate you can say that we give them access to the BC platform. Every ginner will have a code. We don't charge anything from the ginner. 
- We onboard ginners in and around the PU villages, within a 50 to 100 km area. - basically near a farmer. 
- Time for transportation depends on distance between ginner and farmers 
- Demand for cotton has been very low since last year due to international scenario 
No. of ginners working with BC: 
- Every year at the end of Aug every registration is null and void - every year we start from scratch - for the last 2-3 seasons 250 to 270 ginners have been working with us (all the PUs across India). In TN, we have 40 to 50 ginners. Lesser no. in TN as required - it is higher in MH, PB, etc.

Farmers are free to sell with BC registered Ginner or outside, up to them. Factors like cost, immediate payment to farmers-  influences farmers to choose ginner. 	- CoC specifies that ginners have to keep BC cotton separate from conventional cotton.
- During the training we tell them ginners have to maintain separate heaps - some marking has to be there. 
- For quality purpose - we are not caring of the quality as that is commercial discussion - we care only about the segregation 
- How are you ensuring that ginner is segregating? / verification systems: We have an assurance program / third party audits for registered ginners- we have a specific sample - at least 30% of all India ginner verification takes place. 
- CoC is very comprehensive - we have third party assurance 
- Jammikunta ginner mentioned that he does not segregate the cotton - Robin’s reply - if ginner is not able to procure then he cannot list it on the portal. It is not mandatory for the ginner to supply through the portal. 
- We also visit ginners regularly. Ginners are active during the start of September and end in march. 	- Through sales and purchase docs - every Ginner has to have record at farmer level 
- Every farmer has a different code 
- Ginners have to maintain the following data  - Mode of transportation, qty purchased, directly purchased or through middlemen (if middlemen all his info) 
- Transportation data is also captured - vehicle no., etc - supporting docs are also maintained - 
purchase slips (farmer details, etc.), 
quantity slip and 
transportation doc if the transportation is done by the ginner. (there is no uniform transp method, sometimes middlemen collects from 10 farmers and sometimes ginner also sends transportation to farmer) 
- Are these docs sufficient as per you ? - The farmer to gin transaction is unorganized. For eg. B2BCI - limited docs from the actors, all dealings happen in cash, therefore the docs we ask for are sufficient. We are working on some pilots in this regard - but I am not part of it. 
- Risks - sometimes ginners cannot send two vehicles for BC and non BC - we mention in training that separate trucks have to be sent.. 
- We check the size of vehicles during our assessment and the quantity they bring there. Vehicle no. of all BC farmers we will check if the same. 
- We tell them not to mix BC and non BC - since quality is the utmost imp. 
- Purchase slips are also given to farmers 
- We check these slips during verification
	There are risks. 
Non BC farmers - sometimes in heap of BC cotton - conventional cotton is mixed.
	- Overall demand bit low since last two years 
- Since cotton is an export based commodity
- With respect to TN, feedback received is that the quality of the cotton is low - length of the fiber, maturity of the fiber, gin outturn (suppose - I put 100 kg of seed cotton - how much lint and how much seed - out of 100 kg 37/36 kg lint cotton but in TN the recovery is lower. 
- We are getting feedback that a lot of cotton is being transported from TN to the neighboring states, where quality of cotton is better - middlemen doing this to optimize the costs. 
	- Pricing - ginners are saying BC farmers are asking more cost even though we are not getting any profit here. Cotton prices are driven by the market 
- Esp in TN, ginner is saying we are not getting enough info on farmers. Gap between ginner and farmer - struggling in farmer identity. 
	Uptake never as per AAV (always less) - not practical as well.	We have no physical traceability - we are not claiming that the garment is of BC 
But at the ginner side we have traceability 
2 types of CoC model - Physical and mass balance (mb) - from gin to upward actors it is physical and mb. 
After the ginner, we are having a system of BCCU (BC Claim Unit- 1 BCCU = 1 kg of lint cotton) . If 100 kg lint cotton is sold from ginner to spinner then 100 BCCU will appear in the spinner's account. That 100 BCCU can be used by spinner for any cotton. &gt;&gt; this is mb.
This mb points can be used by the spinner without selling the actual cotton 
In mb there is a requirement of physical transaction then only points will be transferred to spinner account. 
During audits, we try to get the sense if points have been transferred without actual physical transfer - we track this. 
In the physical method - cotton has to be segregated at all steps of VC - but there is a risk of mixing. This method we have introduced last year - we use both methods of mb and physical.

	Compliance to credibility
	Sampling	Level of confidence in assurance results	Link to transcript 
Lalit Sharma 	Assurance approach (to understand if PUs are complying to BC standards or not - includes lists etc.) 
- It differs between the PU - licensing for old vs new 
- Partners conduct internal assessment of PU before BC licensing 
- Old PUs - assessment visit, license for three years, whenever it is getting expired BC will do it. 
- Surveillance assessment is for those who have an active license - incase there is any change in farmer participation or if there is any red flag raised in previous visits - then this assessment is conducted. 
- Assurance activities are mostly time bound 
- Assurance is an umbrella term - licensing is just a part of it. Even assessment comes under it like data verification, etc.

Assessment process (Assurance is the umbrella term and assessment is a part of it)
- There are principles and criteria in place which have some indicators in them
- PUs have to comply to these principles 
- Assurance team comprises - 2 sets of assessors (BC + third party verifiers) - 4 organizations currently empanelled as TPV. People like lalit who do assessment - 4 to 5 people 
- PUs are intimated one week in advance - a template is shared with them which outlines the requirements. There are some docs also which are required to be submitted by PU before the assessment - we give them three days to give it to us.
	Role of Lalit : 
- He has joined BC 4 years ago and is  working as Assurance Cooridnator &gt;&gt; he has a reporting manager 
- He is involved in - Assurance activities: 
- Data management (farmers list, adjusted figures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data)  
- Assurance activities calendar preparation  (licensing, etc.) 
- Training of PUMs / FFs on various lists
- Purpose of assurance - whether PUs are complying to standards or not. Within assurance we have different compliances (like list) + assessment conducted every three years. Assurance activities are defined set of requirement for eg. data - early season data, adjusted figures after one month of sowing, farm level data, self assessment, etc. 
- Before the start of the season we approach program partners to ask them about sowing dates, harvesting - based on these dates we decide the calendar activity for PUs 
- Lalit gets data in separate files as per INTL
Expectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors: 
- Requirements to partners made clear 
- We plan our activities in advance so that partners are aware of when to submit 
- We also ensure that data from the field is of good quality - we thoroughly investigate it. 
- All communication from our end should be on time so that PCs have time to complete on time. 
Role of BC staff &amp; TPV same - 3 day exercise 
- 1st day: opening meeting - PUs give introduction / PPT - interview with staff members, During this meeting, they also inform the villages that the team will be visiting the next day
- 2nd day: 2 LGs are covered - 5 farmers from each LG minimum - farmers + workers are interviewed. On this day we tell them about the next day's villages. 
- 3rd day: Morning - 1 LG - 5 farmers meeting - Post lunch: closing remarks / meeting. We dont give any recommendations or idea of how the PU is doing - all that goes in the report. 
- After this - we make a report and submit it to the India Assurance Team and also to the global assurance team. Licensing is in their hands. 
- BC staff and TPV visits separately to separate PUs - we have a ratio of 60:40 - 60% assessment will be done by TPV and 40% by BC. 
- Assessment process same as above 
- There is flexibility in conducting the interviews - more than 3 LGs can also be interviewed - minimum is 3 
- TPV also has to submit a report to India Assurance Team
Support provided by BC to TPV and WWF 
- CS vertical - Relationship management team - in touch with WWF Telangana - we provide the standard protocol to the partners - it is up to them how they want to design the meetings / training calendar -they just have to comply with the principles. Incase PC wants any clarification or want to access a knowledge partner then BC conducts TOT. 
- We have separate templates for different data sets - we train the PUMs and PCs on how to fill this template - since RIR is technical. 
	Integrity of Data: 
- Earlier we had encountered the issue of fake farmers - when we receive the list of farmers from PU we cross check by calling a few farmers and asking them if they know they are a part of the BC program. 
- We have details of PU Staff - who are responsible for particular LGs - we call at least 5-10 farmers under each FF (non lead farmers since they are reliable) 
- Random selection of 5-10 farmers - we used to ask their names, father names, whether they know BC program 
- Right now they dont do this calling exercise - we have told partners that we can do this cross check anytime 
- Processes followed currently - whenever they receive a file they look from quality POV - correct format, units, duplication, etc. 
- For different data sets we have different cleaning exercises. For eg. RIR is checked by the global team. We just glance and check for basic things and follow the global team - they do a deep dive 
Factors considered for credibility in assessment process 
- Process are designed in a way that is impartial 
- It is recommended to assessors not to give suggestions to PUs during their visits 
- Anti bribery policy - no gifts to be considered from PUs 
Risks considered 
- When we used to inform PU about the assessment dates they used to revert saying there is xx festival - so we have asked partners to share dates with us 
- Recently 1 PU told us that there is some staffing issue and all the FFs had got terminated so they asked for time extension - sometimes even PUM not well etc. - so if particular staff is not available we assess how crucial they are for our assessment - if not very crucial then we are ok and continue with the assessment 
- Weather issues - farmers are not in mood to talk when weather is not good 
Efficiency in assurance process 
- Approach is good enough 
- We have an arm for CS also which is unique to BC 
- We have a whole picture in the three day assessment - at the end of the day we want to understand the impact 
- We only talk to 15 farmers but this is good to get an idea - as general practices are same across LGs 
Factors contributing to non compliance from farmers 
- Adoption of PPE kit - we want farmers to use them but weather conditions are such they dont wear 
- Sometimes extension agents (pesticide vendors) tell farmers to mix chemicals 
- Certain chemicals BC bans but it is cheap and easily available to farmers so they opt for it (for eg. monocrotophos) 
- We have run campaigns to discourage such behavior
How do the existing assurance systems and processes work to mitigate the risks/ influence associated with free riders and non-BC farmers?
This will remain a challenge - we dont have details of ALL farmers since we dont have resources for that. Even in the PURE we cant say there wont be free riders 


	- In the limited time we have (3 days) - 15 farmers is fair - but we also do FGDs to cross check 
- Sample size is fixed for us - 15 - random sampling 
- We also talk to local resources - pesticides shop owner, sarpanch, etc. 
- Therefore , 15 farmers + FGDs + local resources is good enough 
- We are well versed on how to talk to farmers and we are also well versed with the geography - makes our job easier 
- He feels the sample size is representative - sampling is done on our own as in the LG selection is on us. We do it on following factors - based on rain fed farmers, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, response of FF in opening meeting 
- Selection bias prevention - Assessors select the LGs 
- Respondent bias prevention - we are as objective as possible 
- Scope of the assessment (duration and sample) limit the assessors’ ability 
In case we feel that three LGs is not enough or if something is inconclusive - we are free to consider 4 or 5 LGs 
- Challenges in assurance process 
- Nothing as such - just the risks i mentioned above
- Remote locations - traveling becomes too far - even between LG farmers 
	- Means of verification used to validate/triangulate the findings - FGDs + local resource information

Participant 	Overview of the MEL approach	Implementation of the MEL system	Quality Assurance	Sampling 	Level of confidence in MEL results	Transcript 
Sonal Dhingra - MEL 	We have split data into two categories - 
- Reach data (area, number of farmers &amp; production) - for each PU we get reach data 
- RIR - Result Indicators Report - sample of farmers taken from each PU and we try to understand -  what was the water use, pesticide use (bio vs chemicals) 
- Sonal majorly deals with RIR data 
What is her role? / activities 
- Sonal is the senior coordinator - global MEL - she works with one more coordinator who looks after reach (Phelix). Shannon - boss of both.  
- We receive this data 12 weeks after the harvest - Sonal does gap analysis (basic completeness check, data validity - eg, area irrigated cannot be higher than area under cultivation, if all active ingredients of a pesticide are listed in the data or not, etc.) - whatever is possible  
- If data is not ok - we reach out to partners 
- Data is recorded in a particular format - from FFB to RIR - the data is not transferred without issues. - so gap analysis helps. 
- After this basic check, we do outlier check - we compare PUs average with the farms average - in terms of yield, if a PUs yield is 135 kg per ha but for a particular farm it is 1000 kg per ha - then we question the data 
- Sometimes it is an error and sometimes it is a genuine issue 
- So there is a lot of back and forth between country MEL, global MEL, partners 
- Farmer level - FFB &gt; FF &gt; PUM + MEL person at partner level &gt; RIR 
- Hidden layer  between FFB and PUM - partners maintain an internal excel which is easy - they agg values and they input the values in the RIR 
- Mostly PUMs fill the RIR with help of FFs or MEL person at partner level
	Set of Activities under MEL (done by Sonal) 
- Gap analysis
- Outlier check (PU’s average with farmer average is compared - involves lot of back and forth - this is a very big issue as it delays sending data further)
- Data updation on Cotton Cloud (database) - Power BI DB 
 
Reporting requirements that Better Cotton MEL mandates from the PU:
- Reach data - broken down in multiple parts - you also get in early season estimates - farmers who are expected to grow cotton this year, etc. we update this figure in terms of area, production, and final number of farmers who are growing cotton (late estimate data) . 
- Then post harvest data - it will come at the same time as RIR 
- RIR data - Main three sheets - area &amp; production, fertilizer use, pesticide use and three more sheets -
- Number of training that happens in the entire season (description, training, duration, attendance, etc.) training is further divided into farmers and workers. 
- Contextual information: we introduced it three years back - questions at PU level - was the water level higher than last year, costs higher than last year, etc. 
- These three sheets help us answer reasons for some outlier 

Support provided by the Better Cotton team to the WWF in the successful completion of the monitoring process
- Dashboards are something that partners are using data quality - how much chemicals / pesticides they have used, income variation across seasons, 
- We are talking with partners regularly and the MEL team trying to collab with partners directly, understanding pain points from partners - RIR
	Are all the types of data collected and reported in a timely manner? If not, what are the reasons for delays? 
- no major delays from Partner (deadline is 3 months after the harvest) they report diligently - but when we get back with clarifications it takes time for them to revert. 
- Deadline for actual sharing of RIR - i have not seen any delays

What are the steps taken to rectify errors found in data collection and entry?
- Yield for alot of farmers is the same in a PU - sampled farmers say 200 -&gt; 100 end up having the same yield. how can that be possible ? - they must be guesstimating - but sometimes there are genuine reasons as all farmers are close by - same climatic conditions, same pest attacks, etc. 
- Farmers usually know their land size in bigha and BC asks for land size in ha, so sometimes the numbers are lost in translation.
- Farmers should be seeing sale receipts - small farmers dont have weighing machines - they dont know how much they have produced and sold. FFs should check the sale receipt. We are trying to put this in the minds of PUMs / FF

What are the challenges encountered by the BC team when data is received from the ground (from partners/country or MEL team)? 
- Timeliness in terms of clarification is a big issue we face. The first set of data they give is timely but when we ask for clarification it takes alot of time and we are frozen. So we are very dependent on partners answers,
- Unit conversion (from bigha to acres to ha as BC demand data in ha) difference in units compared with BC and what is followed region wise - is an issue , 
- Fertilizer - we ask them how much kilogram is used - but since they are small farmers, they report in ML - unit is a big issue.  
Sonal deals with multiple countries so it is even more challenging as farm size categorisation is different across countries. 


	Lot of changes have happened - because of COVID and methodology based changes 
Two types of farmers - BC farmers + Lead farmers (every LG has one) 
Before COVID - 
- we used to sample using 95% CI and 5% MoE - say there are 3500 farmers per PU - we used to ask for 500 to 600 farmers (can be between 350 to 600) - this includes all the lead farmers (100 to 125) + BC farmers 
- Methodology - 100 LGs for any PU - randomly select 10 LGs (country team selects) and pick up all farmers in that LG (35 farmers each LG) - 350 - remaining 90 LGs where lead farmers are selected. 
- Was it representative? Our unit of analysis - LG - LGs were formed to ensure smooth training purposes .. farmers were randomly selected but the lead farmers were not random - so you can say this was a flaw .. at one point we were comparing lead farmers with BC farmers.. We used to also compare BC farmers with comparison farmers of the same PU. 
- Despite all this we were not reporting on lead farmers outside.. (since it was not random sample).. We were reporting on BC farmers versus comparison farmers (non BC farmers) 
Post COVID 
- 95% , 10% - 200 farmers per PU - out of 200 = 100 lead farmers + 100 BC farmers  - mandate to collect lead farmers did not change. 
- 100 BC / lead farmers Farmers - methodology - randomly selected 10 LGs out of which 9 BC farmers randomly selected each LG = 90 BC farmers + 1 Lead farmer from each LG from remaining LGs &gt;&gt;&gt; 200. 
- FFB - 5 farmers each LG since feedback received that a lot of time of FF going behind FFB. Therefore changed to support only 5 farmers per LG. 
- Before COVID all farmers under LG were selected later only few 
- Now I  am more confident in the methodology, it is representative. (PURE) 
- Any suggestions: Lead farmer selection should have been scrapped - 
	For rating of confidence in MEL results see Transcript

Means of Verification: MEL team is not well resourced to do those kind of verifications (Rating: ⅔) - lot of scope for improvement. 
Country workshops are being held - better collabs with partners which will help us better connect with partners.

--- Sheet: Reccos ---
Rakesh - FF 	When asked about the tools for management, used by FF, Rakesh mentioned that  he uses his mobile phone for almost every work. He has to click photos and share with PUM on a daily basis - this leads to a lot of data and ultimately hangs up his phone. He said it would be nice if BC would provide them with tabs.
Nikita - PUM 	Demos are only for few farmers (as impossible to give all farmers the inputs) - many farmers said that we come for training but you select only few. Nikita feels that if demos are done on a larger scale it will be more beneficial. 
Sindhu - PUM 	Doing the compilation is a task and laborious work. She has told BCI many times to reduce the documentation. (BCI in process of developing an app for direct data entry)
Program farmers - female - INTL 23 	shortening the meetings to around 30 minutes.

Women said that they would like to have more season wise trainings but only night / evening time convenient for them as they are free then 

They also suggested to provide cotton storing bags. Big farmers are able to purchase storage materials but small farmers find it difficult. It would be nice if BC could provide us with good quality storage bags 
Program farmers (F) - INTL 02 	They would like to be provided with good quality seeds / subsidy on seeds for organic farming
Co farmers - INTL 02 	Suggestions: Seeds on subsidy basis.
Program farmers (M) INTL 01 	Subsidies for PPE kits, drip and sprinkler irrigation, charger pump and sprayer.
Program farmers (M) INTL 23 	Farmers suggest that the duration of meetings should be reduced to 45 minutes, as the current one-hour meetings are considered too long .. There is a need for free PPE kits, as the cost of Rs. 1000 per kit is burdensome for farmers. They also requested fixed prices for pesticides and fertilizers across outlets to avoid losses .
LEad farmer Srikant (INTL 02) 	Subsidy for seeds, new agricultural methods, labor problem is there, therefore machinery equipment to cut cotton flowers. 
3rd Verifier - Yunus	- Background of partners - Who are the partners, their credibility and past history, experiences in the field etc. could be better assessed before inducting them to the supply chain.

- Data shared should be broad. Currently it is only from the respective PU - rather than the overall data making it difficult to crosscheck (There has been instances where the PUs/LGs disqualified often change their name (INTL X to INTL Y) with the farmers still same. Since the Verifier is only given 3 days onfield - time constraints force such instances difficult to be caught)

Our
 
Motivation
 
and

Statement
 
1.1
  
Motivation
 
 
For
 
the
 
past
 
three
 
decades,
 
CMS
 
delivers
 
research
 
and
 
evaluation
 
with
 
a
 
commitment
 
towards
 
capturing
 
and
 
presenting
 
evidence
 
based
 
decision
 
making
 
and
 
informed
  
development.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As
 
a
 
responsible
 
and
 
committed
 
knowledge
 
organisation,
 
CMS
 
is
 
positioned
 
to
 
conduct
 
thorough
 
program
 
evaluations
 
for
 
developmental
 
initiatives
 
that
 
positively
 
impact
 
vulnerable
 
families,
 
ensuring
 
well-informed
 
developmental
 
outcomes.
 
 
 
Our
 
commitment
 
extends
 
to
 
collaborating
 
with
 
100
 
million
 
families
 
from
 
vulnerable
 
populations
 
facing
 
socio-economic
 
challenges
 
and
 
actively
 
working
 
towards
 
their
 
upliftment.
 
 
Additionally,
 
we
 
are
 
devoted
 
to
 
partnering
 
with
 
cotton
 
cultivators,
 
recognizing
 
the
 
signiﬁcance
 
of
 
cotton
 
as
 
a
 
symbol
 
of
 
sustainability
 
and
 
its
 
role
 
in
 
environmental
 
restoration.
 
 
Our
 
longstanding
 
involvement
 
in
 
this
 
sector
 
has
 
granted
 
us
 
a
 
profound
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
vital
 
connection
 
between
 
cotton
 
cultivation
 
and
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
it
 
sustains.
 
Recognizing
 
the
 
intricacies
 
of
 
this
 
agricultural
 
practice,
 
we
 
aspire
 
to
 
deepen
 
our
 
engagement
 
and
 
contribute
 
meaningfully
 
to
 
the
 
betterment
 
of
 
cultivators'
 
lives.
 
As
 
active
 
proponents
 
of
 
the
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goals,
 
we
 
are
 
steadfast
 
in
 
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
advancing
 
these
 
global
 
objectives.
 
Cotton
 
cultivation,
 
in
 
particular,
 
plays
 
a
 
pivotal
 
role
 
in
 
supporting
 
biodiversity
 
and
 
preserving
 
soil
 
fertility,
 
crucial
 
components
 
for
 
sustainable
 
cultivation.
 
Through
 
our
 
initiatives
 
and
 
partnerships,
 
CMS
 
aims
 
to
 
not
 
only
 
promote
 
sustainable
 
practices
 
but
 
also
 
foster
 
a
 
resilient
 
and
 
thriving
 
ecosystem
 
that
 
beneﬁts
 
both
 
the
 
environment
 
and
 
the
 
communities
 
dependent
 
on
 
cotton
 
cultivation.

baseline
 
assessment
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
Producer
 
Unit
 
(PU)
 
rescoping
 
pilot
 
in
 
Telangana.
 
The
 
intervention
 
aimed
 
to
 
reorganize
 
three
 
existing
 
PUs
 
(INTL01,
 
INTL02,
 
and
 
INTL23),
 
operating
 
across
 
Karimnagar
 
and
 
Warangal
 
districts,
 
into
 
a
 
single,
 
larger
 
unit.
 
This
 
restructuring
 
was
 
designed
 
to
 
enhance
 
scalability,
 
strengthen
 
ﬁeld-level
 
capacity
 
building,
 
streamline
 
data
 
systems,
 
and
 
improve
 
traceability
 
from
 
farm
 
to
 
ginner.
 
The
 
assessment
 
aimed
 
to
 
validate
 
the
 
core
 
problem
 
statements
 
underpinning
 
the
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
and
 
establish
 
benchmark
 
values
 
for
 
seven
 
key
 
performance
 
indicators.
 
It
 
also
 
sought
 
to
 
understand
 
existing
 
ﬁeld
 
realities
 
around
 
data
 
burden,
 
capacity-building
 
efforts,
 
gender
 
participation,
 
and
 
traceability
 
systems.
 
These
 
insights
 
were
 
intended
 
to
 
inform
 
the
 
design,
 
implementation,
 
and
 
future
 
scaling
 
of
 
the
 
reorganized
 
Producer
 
Unit
 
model.
 
Our
 
role
 
involved
 
designing
 
and
 
executing
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
through
 
an
 
integrated
 
methodology—combining
 
qualitative
 
interviews
 
with
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
with
 
120
 
farmers—to
 
generate
 
a
 
robust
 
evidence
 
base
 
for
 
future
 
monitoring
 
and
 
implementation.

Farmer
 
Producer
 
Organizations
 
(FPOs)
 
by
 
introducing
 
poultry

out
 
a
 
new,
 
landscape-based
 
approach
 
to
 
implementing
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
system
 
at
 
the
 
farm
 
level
 
to
 
improve
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Instead
 
of
 
the
 
prevailing
 
method
 
that
 
centres
 
solely
 
on
 
speciﬁed
 
(typically
 
male)
 
farmers
 
on
 
a
 
designated
 
list,
 
PURE
 
broadens
 
its
 
scope
 
to
 
encompass
 
all
 
farming
 
households
 
within
 
a
 
deﬁned
 
geographic
 
unit
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
programs.
 
The
 
PURE
 
pilot
 
has
 
now
 
completed
 
its
 
ﬁrst
 
year
 
of
 
implementation
 
in
 
Karimnagar
 
district
 
of
 
Telangana
 
state,
 
catering
 
to
 
about
 
10,200
 
cotton
 
farmers
 
across
 
148
 
villages.
 
This
 
midline
 
evaluation
 
aims
 
to
 
assess
 
progress
 
toward
 
objectives
 
and
 
identify
 
adjustments
 
needed
 
for
 
optimal
 
implementation
 
in
 
Year
 
 
2.1.1.
 
Objectives
 
of
 
the
 
Program
 
 
The
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
primarily
 
has
 
the
 
following
 
3
 
objectives
 
-
 
 
●
 
Enhance
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
through
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
focusing
 
on
 
natural
 
resources,
 
pest
 
management,
 
labour
 
practices,
 
gender
 
equality,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods.
 
●
 
Improve
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
administration,
 
implementing
 
alternative
 
monitoring
 
methods,
 
and
 
increasing
 
producer
 
unit
 
scale.
 
●
 
Support
 
Better
 
Cotton's
 
traceability
 
goal
 
by
 
strengthening
 
farm-to-gin
 
traceability
 
and
 
eliminating
 
individual
 
farm
 
segregation.
 
2.1.2.
 
Objectives
 
of
 
the

in
 
early
 
2024
 
●
 
Evaluate
 
the
 
feasibility
 
aspects
 
of
 
replicating
 
or
 
scaling
 
up
 
the
 
pilot
 
●

implementation
 
●
 
Provide
 
recommendations
 
on
 
needed
 
adjustments
 
in
 
project
 
assumptions
 
and
 
implementation
 
approaches
 
●
 
Compare
 
the
 
cost-effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
conceptual
 
approaches
 
with
 
the
 
actual
 
ground
 
implementation

Technical
 
Approach
 
3.1
 
Baseline
 
Evaluation
 
Overview
 
CMS
 
conducted
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
in
 
July
 
2024,
 
which
 
brought
 
forth
 
substantial
 
evidence
 
validating
 
issues
 
that
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
intends
 
to
 
address
 
like
 
extensive
 
efforts
 
spent
 
in
 
data
 
and
 
administration,
 
low
 
participation
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
initiatives,
 
less
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
processed
 
in
 
the
 
supply
 
chain,
 
and
 
issues
 
with
 
the
 
associated
 
assurance
 
and
 
MEL
 
systems.
 
For
 
the
 
baseline
 
study,
 
CMS
 
conducted
 
in-depth
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
a
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
1
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
cotton
 
value
 
chain
 
and
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
with
 
120
 
farmers,
 
across
 
the
 
three
 
PUs
 
-
 
INTL01,
 
INTL02
 
and
 
INTL23
 
located
 
in
 
Karimnagar
 
and
 
Warangal
 
districts
 
of
 
Telangana.
 
Factors
 
of
 
heterogeneity
 
in
 
the
 
population
 
such
 
as
 
type
 
of
 
PU,
 
block,
 
village,
 
land
 
size
 
and
 
irrigation
 
pattern
 
were
 
considered
 
to
 
identify
 
and
 
arrive
 
at
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
sample
 
using
 
multi-stage
 
and
 
proportional
 
quota
 
sampling
 
techniques.
 
At
 
the
 
end,
 
CMS
 
provided
 
programmatic
 
level
 
recommendations
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
pilot
 
intervention,
 
from
 
the
 
point
 
of
 
view
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
interviewed
 
such
 
as
 
organising
 
separate
 
meetings
 
for
 
women
 
farmers,
 
simpliﬁcation
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
documentation
 
processes,
 
aggregation
 
and
 
sale
 
of
 
Better
 
cotton
 
etc.
  
 
3.2
 
Monitoring
 
and
 
Evaluation
 
Approach
 
at
 
Midline
 
The
 
midline
 
evaluation
 
approach
 
builds
 
on
 
our
 
baseline
 
methodology
 
while
 
introducing
 
speciﬁc
 
elements
 
for
 
comparative
 
analysis
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
measure
 
progress
 
against
 
baseline
 
benchmarks.
 
Our
 
approach
 
follows
 
a
 
systematic
 
progression
 
as
 
shown
 
below.

will
 
begin
 
with
 
a

of
 
the
 
baseline
 
ﬁndings
 
and
 
a
 
revisit
 
of
 
the
 
Theory

(ToC).
 
This
 
will

assess
 
whether
 
the
 
original

still
 
hold
 
true.
 
Any
 
shifts
 
in
 
the

context
 
or

since
 
the

will
 
be

and
 
learning
 
questions
 
will
 
be
 
reﬁned
 
accordingly
 
to
 
ensure
 
relevance
 
and
 
focus.
 
CMS
 
will
 
examine
 
the
 
degree
 
to
 
which
 
the
 
initial
 
assumptions
 
are
 
holding
 
true
 
after
 
one
 
season
 
of
 
implementation
 
and
 
reﬁne
 
or
 
add
 
learning
 
questions
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
midline
 
captures
 
both
 
progress
 
and
 
potential
 
pivots
 
needed.
 
A

of
 
key
 
project

including
 
implementation
 
progress
 
reports,
 
partner

Development
 
of
 
Data
 
collection
 
tools
 
-
 
Using
 
the
 
baseline
 
tools
 
as
 
a
 
reference,
 
data
 
collection
 
instruments
 
will
 
be
 
updated
 
and
 
expanded
 
to
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
PURE-speciﬁc
 
indicators
 
and
 
additional
 
learning
 
objectives.
 
This
 
includes
 
disaggregating
 
farmer
 
program
 
participation
 
and
 
access
 
by
 
gender,
 
capturing
 
cotton
 
farming
 
areas
 
under
 
uniﬁed
 
management
 
systems,
 
and
 
assessing
 
community-wide
 
engagement.
 
The
 
tools
 
will
 
also
 
track
 
operational
 
efﬁciency
 
metrics,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
ratio
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
capacity
 
building
 
versus
 
administrative
 
tasks.
 
Survey
 
and
 
interview
 
tools
 
would
 
be
 
developed
 
by
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
and
 
validated
 
by
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
and
 
WWF
 
Telangana
 
before
 
being
 
deployed
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
survey
 
would
 
be
 
digitised
 
on
 
the
 
SurveyCTO
 
platform
 
in
 
English
 
and
 
in
 
Telugu.
 
Qualiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
would
 
be
 
hired
 
to
 
administer
 
the
 
CAPI

Field
 
assessment
 
-
 
Having
 
extensively
 
conducted
 
ﬁeld

in
 
southern
 
India
 
(and
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
states
 
of
 
Andhra

milieu
 
and
 
possess
 
excellent
 
written
 
and
 
verbal
 
communication
 
skills
 
in
 
Telugu
 
besides
 
English.
 
The
 
data
 
collection
 
will
 
measure
 
progress
 
against
 
baseline
 
benchmarks
 
and
 
focus
 
on
 
thematic
 
areas
 
such
 
as
 
inclusivity,
 
effectiveness,
 
efﬁciency,

capacity
 
strengthening,
 
gender
 
participation,
 
and
 
trust
 
in
 
the
 
revised

would
 
be
 
conducted
 
with
 
the

The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
collected
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level
 
will
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
advanced
 
statistical
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
STATA.
 
All
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
carried
 
out
 
in
 
stages.
 
At
 
ﬁrst,
 
descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as
 
mean,
 
median,
 
standard
 
deviation,
 
quartile
 
distribution
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
along
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
to
 
measure
 
KPIs.
 
Then
 
as
 
a
 
second
 
step,
 
causality
 
would
 
be
 
established
 
using
 
evaluation
 
methods
 
as
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
methodology
 
adopted
 
for
 
this
 
evaluation.
 
This
 
will
 
provide
 
impact
 
estimates
 
for
 
the

The
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
(FGDs

would
 
provide
 
an

of
 
important
 
stakeholders
 
vis-a-vis
 
the
 
responses
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
assessment.
 
We
 
will
 
prepare
 
thematic

Evaluation
 
Framework
 
○
 
The
 
program
 
MEL
 
objectives
 
and
 
KPIs
 
(measured
 
through
 
the
 
quantitative
 
survey)
 
would
 
be
 
analysed
 
using
 
the
 
OECD
 
DAC
 
deﬁned
 
six
 
evaluation
 
criteria
 
–
 
relevance,
 
coherence,
 
effectiveness,
 
efﬁciency,
 
impact
 
and
 
sustainability
 
(RCEEIS).
 
It
 
is
 
pertinent
 
to
 
mention
 
here
 
that
 
the
 
‘Relevance’
 
criteria
 
was
 
established
 
during
 
the
 
baseline
 
which
 
helped
 
us
 
understand
 
the
 
alignment
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
with
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
and
 
the
 
region.
 
 
○
 
For
 
the
 
midline
 
study,
 
we
 
intend
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
project
 
outcomes
 
considering
 
the
 
criteria
 
of
 
‘Efﬁciency’
 
and
 
‘Effectiveness’.
 
Under
 
Efﬁciency,
 
CMS
 
will
 
assess
 
how
 
well
 
the
 
program
 
has
 
utilized
 
available
 
resources
 
(time,
 
funds,
 
personnel)
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
intended
 
outcomes,
 
including
 
whether
 
the
 
new
 
approach
 
offers
 
better
 
reach
 
and
 
impact
 
with
 
similar
 
or
 
reduced
 
effort
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
traditional
 
model.
 
Under
 
Effectiveness,
 
CMS
 
will
 
assess
 
the
 
extent
 
to
 
which
 
the
 
PURE
 
pilot
 
has
 
achieved
 
its
 
intended
 
objectives
 
—
 
such
 
as
 
increased
 
community
 
participation,
 
gender
 
inclusion,
 
and
 
improved
 
capacity
 
strengthening—after
 
one
 
year
 
of
 
implementation.
 
The
 
criteria
 
of
 
‘Coherence’
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
explored
 
by
 
considering
 
the
 
alignment
 
of
 
the
 
PURE
 
pilot
 
with
 
other
 
initiatives/schemes
 
being
 
implemented
 
in
 
the
 
region
 
by
 
government/non-government
 
entities
 
or
 
market
 
players.

of
 
‘Sustainability’
 
and
 
‘Impact’
 
will
 
be

during
 
the
 
midline
 
but
 
can

in-depth
 
primarily
 
during
 
the

focussed
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
key
 
narratives
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
implementation
 
at
 
midline
 
by
 
establishing
 
the
 
following:
 
1)
 
Evaluation
 
of
 
project
 
objectives
 
at
 
midline
 
 
a)
 
Assess
 
effectiveness
 
and
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
project
 
implementation
 
and
 
management
 
by
 
tracking
 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
at
 
midline
 
and
 
comparing
 
with
 
the
 
baseline.
 
b)
 
Use
 
case-control
 
to
 
separately
 
study
 
farmer
 
cohorts
 
that
 
are
 
performing
 
better
 
or
 
worse
 
at
 
the
 
midline
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
baseline
 
and
 
understand
 
the
 
pathways
 
of
 
change
 
employed
 
by
 
both
 
groups.
  
 
c)
 
Use
 
gender
 
analysis
 
frameworks
 
to
 
be
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
agency
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
in
 
the
 
region;
 
assess
 
their
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
PURE
 
approach
 
vis-à-vis
 
the
 
traditional
 
approach
 
and
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
male
 
farmers.

a)
 
Assess
 
adaptability
 
of
 
the
 
PURE
 
model
 
across
 
geographies
 
and
 
farming
 
contexts
 
b)
 
Evaluate
 
community-wide
 
beneﬁts
 
and
 
ease
 
of
 
implementation
 
3)
 
Drivers
 
of
 
success
 
and
 
the
 
challenges
 
a)
 
Identify
 
key
 
pathways
 
of
 
change
 
and
 
enablers
 
of
 
project
 
participation,
 
effectiveness,
 
ownership,
 
and
 
inclusivity.
 
b)
 
Understand
 
reasons
 
for
 
barriers
 
faced
 
by
 
stakeholders
 
during
 
project
 
implementation,
 
and
 
infer
 
how
 
best
 
these
 
can
 
be
 
addressed.
 
 
4)
 
Cost-Effectiveness
 
Comparison
 
a)
 
Compare
 
resource
 
utilization
 
between
 
traditional
 
BCI
 
and
 
PURE
 
approaches
 
b)
 
Assess
 
impact
 
achieved
 
relative
 
to
 
costs
 
incurred
 
c)
 
The
 
method
 
of
 
Cost-effectiveness
 
analysis
 
(CEA)
 
would
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
determining
 
the
 
‘efﬁciency’
 
parameter
 
of
 
RCEEIS.
 
CEA
 
provides
 
the
 
outcomes
 
of
 
the
 
investment
 
in
 
programs
 
as
 
a
 
simple
 
ratio
 
of
 
costs
 
to
 
impacts.
 
This
 
helps
 
us
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
measure
 
to
 
compare
 
the
 
cost
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
different
 
programs
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
proposal
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
research
 
objective
 
demanding
 
economic
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
Improved
 
cost-efﬁciency
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
implementation.
 
 
5)
 
Veriﬁcation
 
of
 
processes
 
adhered
 
and
 
assumptions
 
a)
 
Examine
 
adherence
 
to
 
PURE
 
pilot
 
design
 
and
 
methodology
 
b)
 
Validate
 
MEL
 
indicators,
 
assurance
 
systems,
 
and
 
implementation
 
assumptions
 
utilised
 
for
 
the
 
PU
 
pilot.
 
 
The
 
above
 
objectives
 
will
 
be
 
achieved
 
through
 
a
 
mixed
 
methods
 
approach
 
involving
  
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
analysis.
 
Conducting
 
this
 
midline
 
evaluation
 
and
 
analysing
 
the
 
outcomes
 
using
 
the
 
OECD
 
DAC
 
RCEEIS
 
criteria
 
is
 
intended
 
to
 
and
 
ultimately
 
aimed
 
at
 
providing
 
evidence
 
(drivers

The

and

Quality
 
Control
 
Mechanism
 
With
 
over
 
200
 
projects
 
and
 
an
 
in-house
 
portfolio
 
for
 
data
 
collection,
 
CMS
 
has
 
strong
 
expertise
 
in
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
Monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring
 
enumerator
 
quality
 
controls
 
with
 
spot
 
checks,
 
back
 
checks
 
(on
 
major
 
topics,
 
time
 
taken,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
looping
 
mechanisms.
 
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes
 
for
 
data
 
management.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.
 
 
Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
data
 
cleaning.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
validation
 
exercise
 
is
 
completed
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
post-cleaning
 
efforts
 
including
 
id
 
variable
 
checking,
 
outlier
 
tagging,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
replacements,
 
illogical
 
value
 
assessment,
 
addressing
 
typos,
 
survey
 
codes,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
adding
 
labels.
 
Irregularities
 
and
 
corrections
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
documented,
 
but
 
changes
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
after
 
introspection
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
insights.

Executive
 
Summary
 
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
Producer
 
Unit
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
has
 
been
 
designed
 
with
 
the
 
3-fold
 
aims
 
of
 
 
(i)
 
Enhancing
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
through
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
focusing
 
on
 
natural
 
resources,
 
pest
 
management,
 
labor
 
practices,
 
gender
 
equality,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods.
 
(ii)
 
Improving
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
administration,
 
implementing
 
alternative
 
monitoring
 
methods,
 
and
 
increasing
 
producer
 
unit
 
scale.
 
(iii)
 
Facilitating
 
improved
 
stronger
 
ﬁrst
 
mile
 
traceability
 
and
 
removing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
physical
 
segregation
 
of
 
cotton
 
from
 
individual
 
farms.
 
The
 
new
 
approach
 
also
 
necessitates
 
relevant
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
assurance,
 
MEL
 
and
 
traceability
 
approaches
 
undertaken
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
attest
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
and
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supplied
 
with
 
a
 
higher
 
degree
 
of
 
conﬁdence.
 
To
 
pilot
 
this
 
intervention,
 
the
 
three
 
Producer
 
Units
 
(INTL01,
 
INTL02,
 
and
 
INTL23)
 
located
 
in
 
Karimnagar
 
and
 
Warangal
 
districts
 
of
 
Telangana
 
will
 
be
 
reorganized
 
into
 
a
 
single,
 
larger
 
Producer
 
Unit.
 
This
 
new
 
unit
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
cover
 
the
 
area
 
previously
 
managed
 
by
 
the
 
three
 
units
 
but
 
will
 
also
 
incorporate
 
new
 
villages
 
and
 
farming
 
households
 
(FHH)
 
from
 
both
 
existing
 
and
 
newly
 
added
 
villages.
 
Baseline
 
approach
 
The
 
baseline
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
Producer
 
unit
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
seeks
 
to
 
validate
 
the
 
problem
 
statements
 
and
 
establish
 
the
 
values
 
of
 
the
 
seven
 
major
 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
at
 
the
 
baseline
 
(prior
 
to
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
intervention)
 
so
 
that
 
measurement
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
KPIs
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
(post
 
the
 
intervention)
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
provide
 
sufﬁcient
 
evidence
 
on
 
the
 
successful
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
approach
 
along
 
with
 
nuanced
 
insights
 
on
 
scaling
 
up
 
of
 
the
 
initiative.
 
In-depth
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
a
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
of
 
120
 
farmers
 
served
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
source
 
of
 
data
 
for
 
this
 
study;
 
with
 
secondary
 
data
 
being
 
referred
 
to
 
gather
 
information
 
on
 
a
 
select
 
few
 
indicators.
 
Efforts
 
involved
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
Interactions
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
revealed
 
that
 
a
 
considerable
 
amount
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
does
 
go
 
into
 
data
 
collection.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
farming
 
season,
 
a
 
fair
 
amount
 
of
 
information
 
on
 
cotton
 
cultivation
 
is
 
gathered
 
using
 
data
 
collection
 
exercises
 
such
 
as
 
early
 
season
 
estimates,
 
farmer
 
ﬁeld
 
books,
 
post
 
harvest
 
estimates,
 
RIR
 
and
 
soil
 
health
 
is
 
collected
 
from
 
the
 
farmers.
 
Overall,
 
FFs
 
report
 
spending
 
nearly
 
30
 
to
 
45%
 
on
 
such
 
data
 
related
 
work,
 
20
 
to
 
30%
 
on
 
administrative
 
work
 
and
 
25%
 
to
 
50%
 
on
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
of
 
farmers.
 
The
 
PUMs
 
also
 
spend
 
a
 
good
 
portion
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
on
 
verifying
 
the
 
data
 
sent
 
by
 
FFs.
 
They
 
reported
 
that
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
manually
 
collecting
 
information,
 
verifying
 
and
 
uploading
 
the
 
same
 
in
 
soft
 
copies
 
is
 
particularly
 
cumbersome.
 
Even
 
while
 
being
 
inherently
 
motivated
 
to
 
put
 
in
 
a
 
higher
 
number
 
of
 
hours
 
doing
 
ﬁeld
 
work,
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
mentioned
 
that
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
farmers
 
is
 
what
 
enables
 
them
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
issues
 
faced
 
by
 
the
 
farmers
 
in
 
adoption
 
of
 
practices
 
in
 
turn
 
contributing
 
towards
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
sustainability
 
objectives.
 
Hence,
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
to
 
reduce
 
efforts
 
involved
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
increase
 
time
 
spent
 
in
 
strengthening
 
the
 
capacity
 
of
 
the
 
farmers
 
was
 
evidenced
 
from
 
the
 
baseline
 
study.
 
 
Women
 
Participation
 
The
 
focus
 
and
 
reach
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
programs
 
towards
 
women
 
farmers
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
lower
 
side
 
at
 
present.
 
In
 
a
 
traditional
 
PU
 
catering
 
to
 
around
 
3000-3500
 
farmers,
 
~98%
 
are
 
men,
 
and
 
~2%
 
to
 
3%
 
are
 
women.
 
Women
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
primarily
 
because
 
of
 
beneﬁts
 
such
 
as
 
enhancement
 
in
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
their
 
crops
 
and
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
ﬁnancially
 
support
 
their
 
4
 


 
households.
 
Interestingly,
 
the
 
uptake
 
of
 
practices
 
(such
 
as
 
intercropping,
 
border
 
cropping,
 
optimizing
 
land
 
use
 
and
 
improving
 
crop
 
diversity)
 
and
 
accrual
 
of
 
beneﬁts
 
was
 
noted
 
to
 
be
 
much
 
higher
 
for
 
women
 
farmers
 
and
 
co-farmers
 
belonging
 
to
 
the
 
INTL01/02
 
PUs
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
relatively
 
newer
 
INTL23.
 
Non-program
 
farmers
 
also
 
expressed
 
their
 
interest
 
in
 
becoming
 
a
 
program
 
farmer
 
and
 
adopting
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
practices,
 
provided
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
are
 
held
 
at
 
a
 
time,
 
frequency
 
and
 
duration
 
of
 
their
 
convenience.
 
All
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
remarks
 
point
 
towards
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
higher
 
extent
 
of
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
efforts
 
to
 
be
 
directed
 
towards
 
women
 
farmers,
 
especially
 
those
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PUs.
 
 
Effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
Inferences
 
from
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
farmers
 
(mostly
 
male)
 
provides
 
credible
 
evidence
 
towards
 
the
 
quality
 
and
 
efﬁcacy
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
while
 
also
 
indicating
 
farmer
 
preferences
 
for
 
more
 
audio-visual
 
training
 
content
 
and
 
farm
 
exposure
 
visits.
 
Similar
 
to
 
data
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
women
 
program
 
farmers,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
also
 
revealed
 
that
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
adoption
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
practices
 
was
 
higher
 
in
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
older
 
PU
 
(INTL01/02)
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
newer
 
one
 
(INTL23).
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
noted
 
that
 
getting
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
topics
 
(94%),
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
teaching
 
approach
 
of
 
the
 
facilitator
 
(72%),
 
handholding
 
support
 
provided
 
in
 
adoption
 
of
 
practices
 
(61%)
 
and
 
going
 
on
 
exposure
 
visits
 
(91%)
 
were
 
the
 
major
 
reasons
 
for
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PU
 
to
 
continue
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Higher
 
yield
 
and
 
improved
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton
 
were
 
the
 
main
 
beneﬁts
 
that
 
about
 
86%
 
and
 
57%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
reported
 
from
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
50%
 
and
 
20%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU.
 
The
 
uptake
 
of

was
 
lesser
 
in

mainly
 
due
 
an
 
earlier
 
dissatisfying
 
experience
 
that

Assurance
 
approach
 
The
 
assurance
 
approach
 
practiced
 
traditionally
 
was
 
described
 
as
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
process.
 
The
 
licensing
 
assessments
 
take
 
place
 
in
 
3
 
years
 
for
 
each
 
PU
 
and
 
are
 
aimed
 
at
 
verifying
 
if
 
PUs
 
are
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards
 
of
 
cotton
 
production.

are
 
conducted
 
with

independent
 
stakeholders
 
not
 
directly
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
PU.
 
The
 
Better

assurance
 
coordinator
 
expressed
 
a
 
good
 
degree
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
assurance
 
system
 
being
 
used
 
at
 
present.
  
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation
 
and
 
Learning
 
approach
 
 
The
 
MEL
 
coordinator
 
elaborated
 
on
 
the
 
MEL
 
systems
 
and
 
processes
 
put
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
continuously
 
monitor
 
the
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
data
 
required
 
-
 
mainly
 
reach,
 
farmer
 
lists
 
and
 
RIR.
 
Thorough
 
checking
 
and
 
veriﬁcation
 
of
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
data
 
takes
 
place
 
at
 
every
 
stage
 
of

collection
 
and
 
reporting.
 
A
 
moderate-to-high
 
degree
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
was
 
expressed
 
by
 
the
 
coordinator
 
in
 
the
 
MEL
 
approach
 
utilized,
 
while
 
also
 
highlighting
 
a
 
small
 
ﬂaw
 
in
 
sampling
 
of
 
lead

as
 
compared
 
to
 
the

Supply
 
chain
 
credibility
 
Interactions
 
with
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
coordinator
 
and
 
the
 
ginner
 
brought
 
out
 
pressing
 
issues
 
affecting
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
uptake
 
and
 
supply
 
chain
 
credibility.
 
It
 
was
 
mentioned
 
that
 
given
 
the
 
low
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
being
 
procured
 
by
 
the
 
ginners
 
in
 
the
 
region,
 
it
 
is
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
him
 
to
 
segregate
 
and
 
process
 
it
 
separately
 
as
 
against
 
the
 
processing
 
of
 
conventional
 
cotton.
 
The
 
supply
 
chain
 
coordinator
 
also
 
reiterated
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
gets
 
challenged
 
by
 
the
 
potential
 
mixing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
during
 
transportation
 
and
 
processing.
 
To
 
mitigate
 
this,
 
regular
 
visits
 
to
 
ginners
 
are
 
conducted
 
during
 
the
 
active
 
season
 
from
 
September
 
to
 
March
 
to
 
enforce
 
segregation
 
standards.

Recommendations
 
Findings
 
from
 
the
 
baseline
 
bring
 
forth
 
substantial
 
evidence
 
for
 
the
 
issues
 
-
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
efforts
 
spent
 
in
 
data
 
and
 
administration,
 
low
 
participation
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
in
 
the

processed
 
in
 
the

and
 
the

and
 
MEL
 
systems
 
-
 
that
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
intends
 
to
 
address.

such
 
as
 
domestic

●
 
Expand
 
the
 
scale
 
of

so
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
more
 
beneﬁcial

●
 
Incorporate
 
more

convenient
 
to
 
them.
 
●
 
Farmers
 
requested
 
to
 
provide
 
free
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
as
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
₹
1000

While
 
larger
 
farmers
 
can
 
purchase

Introduction
 
1.1.
 
Background
 
of
 
the
 
PURE
 
project
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
stands
 
as
 
the
 
globe's
 
foremost
 
cotton
 
sustainability
 
initiative.
 
Its
 
mission
 
is
 
to
 
help
 
'cotton
 
communities
 
survive
 
and
 
thrive,
 
while
 
protecting
 
and
 
restoring
 
the
 
environment’.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
seeks
 
to
 
transform
 
cotton
 
production
 
worldwide
 
by
 
promoting
 
more
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices,
 
improving
 
livelihoods,
 
and
 
ensuring
 
the
 
long-term
 
health
 
of
 
farming
 
communities
 
and
 
the
 
environment.
 
The
 
innovative
 
pilot
 
project
 
called
 
-
 
the
 
'Producer
 
Unit
 
Rescoping'
 
(PURE)
 
pilot
 
aims
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
a
 
new,
 
geographic
 
approach
 
to
 
implementing
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Standard
 
System
 
to
 
improve
 
efﬁciency,
 
effectiveness
 
and
 
sustainability
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
by
 
supporting
 
more
 
holistic,
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
-
 
especially
 
around
 
the
 
six
 
principles
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
namely,
 
Management,
 
Natural
 
Resources,
 
Crop
 
Protection,
 
Fibre
 
Quality,
 
Decent
 
Work,
 
and
 
Sustainable
 
Livelihoods.
 
Replacing
 
the
 
prevailing
 
method
 
that
 
centers
 
solely
 
on
 
speciﬁed
 
(typically
 
male)
 
farmers
 
on
 
a
 
designated
 
list,
 
PURE
 
broadens
 
its
 
scope
 
to
 
encompass
 
all
 
farming
 
households
 
within
 
a
 
deﬁned
 
geographic
 
unit
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
The
 
project
 
envisages
 
improving
 
the
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
and
 
administration
 
efforts
 
associated
 
with
 
farmer
 
lists
 
or
 
other
 
data
 
related
 
processes,
 
and
 
using
 
alternate
 
methods
 
to
 
monitor
 
implementation
 
(such
 
as
 
periodic
 
baseline
 
studies,
 
GIS
 
and
 
government
 
data,
 
gin
 
procurement
 
volumes,
 
and
 
other
 
secondary
 
sources).
 
The
 
pilot
 
aims
 
to
 
support
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
overall
 
goal
 
towards
 
traceability
 
by
 
facilitating
 
stronger
 
farm-to-gin
 
traceability
 
and
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
segregate
 
cotton
 
from
 
individual
 
farms.
 
 
1.2.
 
Objectives
 
of
 
the
 
Program
 
 
The
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
producer
 
unit
 
rescoping
 
pilot
 
are
 
as
 
follows
 
-
  
 
●
 
Enhance
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
through
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
focusing
 
on
 
natural
 
resources,
 
pest
 
management,
 
labor
 
practices,
 
gender
 
equality,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods.
 
●
 
Improve
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
administration,
 
implementing
 
alternative
 
monitoring
 
methods,
 
and
 
increasing
 
producer
 
unit
 
scale.
 
●
 
Facilitating
 
improved
 
stronger
 
ﬁrst
 
mile
 
traceability
 
and
 
removing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
physical
 
segregation
 
of
 
cotton
 
from
 
individual
 
farms.

Tool
 
design
 
and

Qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
survey
 
and
 
interview
 
tools
 
were
 
developed
 
by
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
in
 
thorough
 
consultation
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
before
 
being
 
ﬁnalized
 
and
 
deployed
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
survey
 
was
 
digitized
 
on
 
the
 
SurveyCTO
 
platform
 
in
 
English
 
and
 
in
 
Telugu.
 
Qualiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
and
 
moderators
 
were
 
hired
 
to
 
administer
 
the
 
CAPI
 
tool
 
and
 
facilitate
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
respectively.
     
 
Detailed
 
qualitative
 
guides
 
were
 
developed
 
to
 
facilitate
 
semi-structured
 
conversations
 
with
 
stakeholders
 
on
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 
such
 
as

women
 
participation,
 
increase

and
 
the
 
supporting
 
activities
 
such
 
as
 
monitoring,
 
evaluation,
 
assurance
 
and
 
supply
 
chain.
 
While
 
the
 
quantitative
 
tool
 
helped
 
get
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
awareness
 
and
 
adoption
 
of
 
better
 
cotton
 
practices
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
farmers,
 
the
 
qualitative
 
tools
 
captured
 
the
 
perceptions
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
on
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
KPIs,
 
and
 
the
 
causal
 
relationships
 
underlying
 
their
 
perceptions.
 
Data
 
on
 
the
 
reach
 
of
 
the
 
program,
 
area
 
of
 
production,
 
yield
 
etc
 
was
 
collected
 
from
 
the
 
secondary
 
sources
 
of
 
information
 
readily
 
available
 
with
 
the

strategy
 
described
 
below.
 
Information
 
was
 
captured
 
qualitatively
 
using

Data
 
Collection
 
and
 
Management
 
For
 
ﬁeld
 
data
 
collection
 
in
 
Telangana,
 
CMS
 
deployed
 
an
 
experienced
 
set
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
researchers
   
with
 
domain
 
experience
 
within
 
the
 
pool
 
of
 
trained
 
and
 
ethical
 
certiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
from
 
the
 
Community
 
Engagement
 
unit.
 
This
 
team
 
was
 
managed
 
by
 
ﬁeld
 
coordinators
 
and
 
the
 
Field
 
Manager
 
of
 
the
 
South
 
Zone.
 
A
 
total
 
of
 
6
 
enumerators
 
(male),
 
1
 
supervisor
 
(female)
 
and
 
2
 
moderators
 
were
 
employed
 
for
 
this
 
activity.
 
2
 
researchers
 
from
 
the
 
CMS
 
research
 
team
 
were
 
also
 
an
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
team
 
and
 
were
 
present
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process,
 
closely
 
engaging
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions.
  
 
The
 
ﬁeld
 
teams
 
were
 
trained
 
on
 
the
 
survey
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
tools
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
translators
 
by
 
the
 
core
 
research
 
team
 
with
 
the
 
assistance
 
from
 
the
 
Field
 
Manager.
 
A
 
training
 
session
 
was
 
conducted
 
at
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
location
 
and
 
covered
 
the
 
following
 
topics:
 
background
 
of
 
the
 
project,
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study,
 
induction
 
to
 
SurveyCTO,
 
protocol
 
to
 
administer
 
the
 
questionnaire,
 
questionnaire
 
ﬂow
 
and
 
data
 
entry
 
dos
 
and
 
don'ts.
 
 
After
 
the
 
training,
 
we
 
conducted
 
pilot
 
surveys
 
at
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
locations
 
with
 
active
 
assistance
 
from
 
the
 
core
 
research
 
team
 
to
 
identify
 
issues
 
if
 
any
 
and
 
incorporate
 
the
 
feedback
 
received
 
to
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
tool.
 
Utmost
 
care
 
was
 
taken
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
researchers
 
sensitized
 
to
 
conducting
 
interviews
 
with
 
female
 
respondents
 
while
 
leading
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
either
 
individual
 
or
 
group
 
of
 
female
 
respondents.
 
 
Both
 
the
 
KIIs
 
and
 
FGDs
 
were
 
conducted
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
and
 
place
 
convenient
 
for
 
the
 
respondents.
 
The
 
WWF
 
team,
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
PUM
 
and
 
FFs
 
assisted
 
CMS
 
in
 
planning
 
the
 
village
 
visits,
 
as
 
they
 
had
 
a
 
better
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
proximity
 
between
 
sampled
 
villages
 
and
 
respondent’s
 
time
 
preferences.
 
This
 
enabled
 
CMS
 
to
 
conduct
 
interviews
 
efﬁciently,
 
scheduling
 
them
 
back-to-back
 
and
 
minimizing
 
wastage
 
of
 
time.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
period,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
coordinated
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
to
 
understand
 
any
 
issues
 
faced
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
worked
 
to
 
resolve
 
them
 
shortly
 
after.

Challenges
 
faced
 
during
 
data
 
collection
 
Despite
 
the
 
support
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
WWF
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
in
 
planning
 
the
 
ﬁeldwork
 
and
 
mobilizing
 
the
 
respondents,
 
some
 
challenges
 
were
 
encountered
 
during
 
data
 
collection.
 
These
 
included
 
difﬁculties
 
in
 
ﬁnding
 
women
 
respondents
 
for
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
(as
 
per
 
the
 
sampling
 
requirements)
 
and
 
challenges
 
posed
 
due
 
to
 
language
 
constraints.
 
While
 
the
 
local
 
enumerators
 
recruited
 
by
 
CMS
 
were
 
well-versed
 
with
 
the
 
language
 
and
 
communicated
 
smoothly
 
with
 
the
 
respondents,
 
the
 
language
 
constraints
 
were
 
particularly
 
faced
 
by
 
CMS
 
researchers
 
who
 
do
 
not
 
understand
 
the
 
local
 
language.
 
However,
 
the
 
enumerators
 
took
 
care
 
to
 
translate
 
and
 
explain
 
the
 
points
 
being
 
discussed
 
in
 
the
 
interactions
 
to
 
the
 
researchers
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
the
 
interview.

The
 
overall
 
KPIs
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
can
 
broadly
 
be
 
divided
 
into
 
2
 
categories.
 
There
 
are
 
3
 
overall
 
project
 
KPIs
 
primarily
 
designed
 
to
 
understand
 
if
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
project
 
was
 
successful
 
in
 
achieving
 
its
 
speciﬁc
 
targets
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
scaled
 
up
 
without
 
necessarily
 
adding
 
to
 
the
 
project
 
costs.
 
The

collecting
 
some
 
of
 
the

I
 
had
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
reduce
 
environmental

and
 
help
 
farmers
 
strengthen
 
their
 
capacity,
 
which
 
also
 
contributes
 
to
 
reducing
 
soil

These
 
experiences
 
motivated
 
me

I
 
am
 
passionate
 
about
 
serving

for

the

It

it
 
difﬁcult

As

from
 
ﬁeld

the
 
broad
 
responsibilities
 
of
 
an
 
FF
 
are
 
●

-
 
FFs
 
ensure
 
that
 
farmers
 
are
 
listing
 
the
 
correct
 
information.
 
Sometimes
 
if
 
FFs
 
are
 
unable
 
to

the

their
 
fellow
 
farmers
 
or

from
 
farmers
 
on
 
various

-
 
FFs
 
are
 
entrusted
 
with
 
doing
 
the
 
ground
 
level
 
data
 
collection
 
for
 
lists
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
farmers
 
list,
 
adoption
 
data
 
and
 
RIR.
 
Although
 
FFs
 
do
 
not
 
directly
 
input
 
data
 
into
 
the
 
RIR,
 
WWF
 
has
 
provided
 
them
 
with
 
simpliﬁed
 
data
 
collection
 
sheets.
 
These
 
sheets
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
FFs
 
to
 
gather
 
accurate
 
information,
 
which
 
is
 
then
 
reviewed
 
by
 
the
 
PUM
 
and
 
digitized
 
for
 
ofﬁcial
 
use.
 
Apart
 
from
 
the
 
above
 
mentioned
 
lists,
 
the
 
FFs
 
are
 
also
 
maintaining
 
an
 
LG
 
attendance
 
book.
 
Farmers
 
are
 
mandated
 
to
 
sign
 
the
 
attendance
 
book
 
after
 
every

Capacity
 
strengthening
 
of
 
Farmers
 
-
 
FFs,
 
on
 
an
 
everyday
 
basis,
 
conduct
 
CS
 
training
 
to
 
educate
 
the
 
farmers
 
on
 
an
 
array
 
of
 
topics
 
like
 
water
 
management,
 
biodiversity,
 
soil
 
health
 
management,
 
storage
 
of
 
cotton,
 
ways
 
to
 
increase
 
fertility
 
of
 
land,
 
reduction
 
in
 
water
 
pollution,
 
etc.
 
Nearly
 
20
 
to
 
30
 
farmers
 
typically
 
attend
 
these
 
training
 
sessions.
 
For
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
unable
 
to
 
participate,
 
the
 
FFs
 
make
 
personal
 
visits
 
to
 
their
 
homes
 
or
 
farms
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
are
 
informed
 
about
 
the
 
topics
 
covered.
 
Additionally,
 
FFs
 
follow
 
up
 
with
 
these
 
farmers
 
by
 
phone,
 
encouraging
 
them
 
to
 
attend
 
the
 
next
 
training
 
session.
 
For
 
these
 
trainings,
 
FFs
 
carry
 
communication
 
material
 
like
 
ﬂexes,
 
pamphlets,
 
stickers,
 
etc.
 
Out
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
material
 
aid,
 
FFs
 
believe
 
that
 
displaying
 
ﬂexes
 
is
 
very
 
impactful
 
and
 
helpful
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
to
 
understand
 
concepts
 
easily.
 
 
●
 
Community
 
level
 
activities
 
like
 
Rallies,
 
AV
 
shows,
 
demos

In
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
CS
 
training,
 
FFs
 
also
 
arrange
 
rallies,
 
demonstrations,
 
and
 
AV
 
shows
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
understand
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
principles
 
better.
 
During
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
it
 
was
 
found
 
that
 
these
 
18
 


 
activities
 
have
 
a
 
huge
 
spillover
 
effect
 
on
 
non
 
program
 
farmers
 
as
 
they
 
tend
 
to
 
see
 
or

to
 
the
 
topics
 
covered
 
in
 
these
 
sessions.

to
 
the
 
respective
 
PUM
 
which
 
consists
 
of
 
the
 
challenges,
 
suggestions,
 
requirements
 
and
 
other
 
feedback
 
from
 
the
 
farmers
 
on
 
ﬁeld.
 
The
 
Action
 
Plan
 
is
 
reviewed
 
by
 
the
 
PUMs
 
and
 
APUMs
 
to
 
strategize
 
the
 
activities
 
to
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
the
 
respective
 
PUs.
 
The
 
document
 
also
 
serves
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
ensuring
 
a
 
detailed
 
brainstorming
 
on
 
the
 
respective
 
PUs
 
with
 
the
 
on-ground
 
experiences
 
and
 
perspectives
 
of
 
the
 
FFs.
 
 
Overall,
 
FFs
 
report
 
spending
 
nearly
 
30
 
to
 
45%
 
on
 
data
 
related
 
work,
 
20
 
to
 
30%
 
on
 
admin
 
work
 
and
 
25%
 
to
 
50%
 
on
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
of
 
farmers.
 
 
 
Time
 
distribution
 
of
 
Work:
 
FFs
 
spend
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
on
 
data-related
 
tasks,
 
such
 
as
 
data
 
entry
 
and
 
updating
 
farmer
 
lists.
 
These
 
tasks
 
consume
 
nearly
 
30
 
to
 
40%
 
of
 
their
 
overall
 
work
 
time.
 
They
 
further
 
lament
 
that
 
such
 
extensive
 
focus
 
on
 
data
 
work
 
often
 
leads
 
to
 
physical
 
discomfort,
 
including
 
shoulder
 
and
 
eye
 
strain,
 
and
 
detracts
 
the
 
FFs
 
from
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
engage
 
directly
 
with
 
farmers—a
 
task
 
they
 
ﬁnd
 
far
 
more
 
rewarding
 
and
 
impactful.
 
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
spend
 
more
 
time
 
on
 
training
 
because
 
excessive
 
data
 
work
 
gives
 
me
 
shoulder
 
and
 
eye
 
pain.
 
I
 
ﬁnd
 
interacting
 
with
 
farmers
 
more
 
fruitful.
 
Given
 
an
 
option
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
reduce
 
my
 
data

Field
 
Facilitator
 
of
 
INTL23
 
 
The
 
FFs
 
expressed
 
a
 
strong
 
preference
 
for
 
reducing
 
their
 
data
 
entry
 
workload
 
to
 
allocate
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
capacity-strengthening
 
activities,
 
such
 
as
 
training
 
farmers
 
on
 
sustainable
 
agricultural
 
practices.
 
Besides
 
aligning
 
to
 
their
 
personal
 
interests,
 
FFs
 
believe
 
that
 
these
 
interactions
 
provide
 
immediate
 
beneﬁts
 
to
 
farmers.
 
For
 
instance,
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
facilitator
 
of
 
INTL02
 
mentioned
 
that
 
he
 
ﬁnds
 
transferring
 
well
 
monitoring
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
to
 
Google
 
Sheets
 
unnecessary.
 
He
 
suggested
 
that
 
this
 
time
 
could
 
be
 
better
 
spent
 
training
 
farmers
 
who
 
cultivate
 
crops
 
like
 
maize,
 
paddy,
 
and
 
others
 
along
 
with
 
cotton.
 
Additionally,
 
he
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
Farmers
 
List
 
collection
 
and
 
updation
 
is
 
a
 
time
 
consuming
 
process
 
which
 
takes
 
up
 
almost
 
15
 
days
 
annually
 
to
 
cover
 
all
 
the
 
villages
 
under
 
him.
 
 
 
FFs
 
recognize
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
data
 
in
 
monitoring
 
and
 
supporting
 
their
 
efforts,
 
understanding
 
that
 
it
 
plays
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
assessing
 
the
 
local
 
situation
 
and
 
tailoring
 
their
 
training
 
sessions
 
accordingly.
 
Despite
 
understanding
 
this,
 
FFs
 
are
 
eager
 
to
 
shift
 
the
 
balance,
 
by
 
spending
 
less
 
time
 
on
 
data
 
tasks
 
and
 
more
 
on
 
direct,
 
impactful
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
farming
 
communities.
 
 
Challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
FFs:
 
FFs
 
encounter
 
challenges
 
with
 
incorrect
 
data
 
and
 
delays
 
in
 
data
 
sharing,
 
often
 
requiring
 
time-consuming
 
follow-ups.
 
These
 
inaccuracies
 
can
 
compromise
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
related
 
data
 
sheets,
 
making
 
the
 
process
 
particularly
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
the
 
FFs
 
to
 
manage
 
effectively.
 
 
Suggestions
 
by
 
FF
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton:
 
FF
 
shared
 
that
 
they
 
rely
 
heavily
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
phone
 
for
 
nearly
 
every
 
task,
 
including
 
taking
 
photos
 
and
 
sending
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
PUM
 
daily.
 
This
 
constant
 
use
 
generates
 
a
 
large
 
amount
 
of
 
data,
 
which
 
often
 
causes
 
their
 
phone
 
to
 
lag
 
or
 
freeze.
 
They
 
suggested
 
19
 


 
that
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
beneﬁcial
 
if
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
could
 
provide
 
them
 
with
 
tablets
 
to
 
better
 
manage
 
these
 
tasks.
 
Additionally,
 
to
 
boost
 
female
 
participation,
 
FF
 
thinks
 
it
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
organize
 
additional,
 
separate
 
meetings
 
speciﬁcally
 
for
 
women
 
farmers,
 
addressing
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
encounter,
 
such
 
as
 
domestic
 
responsibilities
 
and
 
long
 
travel
 
distances.
 
Moreover,
 
incorporating
 
more
 
audiovisual
 
tools
 
into
 
training
 
sessions
 
can
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improve
 
farmers'
 
understanding
 
and
 
retention
 
of
 
the
 
material.
 
 
Producer
 
Unit
 
Managers
 
(PUM)
 
 
Each
 
PU
 
is
 
assigned
 
a
 
manager
 
(PUM)
 
who
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
overseeing
 
work
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
FFs
 
and
 
by
 
virtue
 
the
 
farmers
 
within
 
their
 
unit.
 
Every
 
PUM
 
has
 
an
 
assistant
 
PUM
 
(APUM)
 
who
 
helps
 
the
 
former
 
in
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
training,
 
documentation,
 
veriﬁcation
 
and
 
monitoring.
 
The
 
PUMs
 
are
 
primarily
 
tasked
 
with
 
managing
 
and
 
compiling
 
all
 
the
 
data
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
submitted
 
to
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
their
 
data
 
responsibilities,
 
PUMs
 
also
 
educate
 
FFs
 
on
 
various
 
topics
 
to
 
be
 
taught
 
to
 
farmers,
 
tailoring
 
the
 
content
 
to
 
the
 
local
 
context.
 
PUMs
 
daily
 
spend
 
half
 
an
 
hour
 
to
 
one
 
hour
 
with
 
the
 
FFs
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
are
 
facing
 
(if
 
any),
 
their
 
learnings,
 
etc.
 
PUMs
 
regularly
 
visit
 
the
 
ﬁelds
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
training
 
sessions
 
are
 
conducted
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
prescribed
 
format.
 
They
 
also
 
address
 
farmer
 
queries
 
and,
 
when
 
necessary,
 
visit
 
their
 
farms.
 
 
 
PUMs
 
handle
 
multiple
 
lists
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
and
 
have
 
to
 
strictly
 
adhere
 
to
 
the
 
timelines
 
speciﬁed
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
At
 
any
 
given
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
PUMs
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
some
 
data.
 
As
 
the
 
deadline
 
for
 
any
 
data
 
list
 
approaches,
 
the
 
PUMs
 
often
 
ﬁnd
 
themselves
 
dedicating
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
to
 
completing
 
it,
 
sometimes
 
at
 
the
 
expense
 
of
 
conducting
 
farmer
 
training
 
sessions.
 
PUMs
 
mentioned
 
that
 
compiling
 
all
 
the
 
data
 
received
 
(from
 
the
 
FFs),
 
followed
 
by
 
cross
 
checking
 
and
 
correcting
 
duplicated
 
data,
 
is
 
a
 
laborious
 
and
 
complex
 
task
 
and
 
has
 
a
 
direct
 
effect
 
on
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
concentrate
 
on
 
farmer
 
training.
 
 
 
In
 
a
 
year,
 
PUMs
 
are
 
mandated
 
to
 
conduct
 
6
 
farmer
 
trainings
 
per
 
LG
 
and
 
conduct
 
around
 
3
 
to
 
4
 
special
 
activities
 
like
 
AVs,
 
demos,
 
etc.
 
PUMs
 
conduct
 
training
 
sessions
 
as
 
the
 
farmers
 
are
 
curious
 
to
 
know
 
about
 
new
 
methods
 
(like
 
PB
 
Knot,
 
Cremigel
 
etc.)
 
and
 
implement
 
it
 
in
 
their
 
ﬁeld.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
most
 
impactful
 
aspect
 
of
 
their
 
work,
 
PUMs
 
highlighted
 
their
 
preference
 
for
 
training
 
both
 
farmers
 
and
 
FFs.
 
They
 
emphasized
 
that
 
FFs
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
critical
 
link
 
between
 
the
 
farmers
 
and
 
the
 
ofﬁce
 
team,
 
making
 
their
 
education
 
essential
 
for
 
the
 
overall
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Apart
 
from
 
training
 
the
 
FFs
 
and
 
farmers,
 
PUMs
 
also
 
provide
 
special
 
training
 
to
 
anganwadi
 
workers,
 
ASHA
 
workers,
 
healthcare
 
workers,
 
pesticides
 
sprayers,
 
school
 
children
 
etc
 
on
 
the
 
relevant
 
principles
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
 
 
Apart
 
from
 
the
 
data
 
work
 
and
 
farmer
 
and
 
FF
 
training,
 
PUMs
 
also
 
do
 
some
 
level
 
of
 
administrative
 
work
 
like
 
recruiting
 
FFs.
 
Overall,
 
PUMs
 
allocate
 
5%
 
to
 
10%
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
to
 
administrative
 
tasks
 
and
 
30%
 
to
 
35%
 
to
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
activities.
 
However,
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
their
 
time,
 
around
 
50%-60%,
 
is
 
consumed
 
by
 
data-related
 
work.
 
While
 
FFs
 
collect
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
ﬁeld,
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
responsibility
 
of
 
the
 
PUMs
 
to
 
oversee
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process
 
and
 
check
 
the
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
reported
 
data.
 
At
 
least
 
20%
 
of
 
the
 
collected
 
data
 
is
 
veriﬁed
 
by
 
the
 
PUMs.
 
While
 
they
 
recognize
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
maintaining
 
accurate
 
data
 
records
 
as
 
proof
 
that
 
farmers
 
are
 
adhering
 
to
 
program
 
objectives,
 
they
 
expressed
 
a
 
preference
 
for
 
spending
 
more
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
They
 
believe
 
that
 
reducing
 
data
 
entry
 
tasks
 
would
 
not
 
only
 
increase
 
their
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
happiness
 
but
 
also
 
enhance
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
understand
 
and
 
address
 
the
 
challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
farmers.

Project
 
Coordinator
 
 
During
 
our
 
ﬁeld
 
visit,
 
we
 
spoke
 
to
 
Satish
 
Botla,
 
a
 
consultant
 
for
 
WWF
 
India
 
and
 
the
 
Project
 
Coordinator
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
in
 
the
 
Karimnagar
 
cluster.
 
He
 
handles
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of
 
responsibilities
 
including
 
both
 
administrative
 
and
 
technical
 
domains.
 
 
 
On
 
the
 
administrative
 
side,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
is
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
collection
 
and
 
organization
 
of
 
data
 
for
 
project
 
proposals
 
and
 
the
 
submission
 
of
 
annual
 
reports
 
to
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
He
 
regularly
 
conducts
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
typically
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
times
 
a
 
week,
 
to
 
monitor
 
project
 
activities,
 
review
 
progress,
 
and
 
ensure
 
compliance
 
with
 
project
 
goals.
 
His
 
administrative
 
duties
 
also
 
include
 
staff
 
recruitment
 
and
 
supervision,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
conducting
 
internal
 
reviews
 
where
 
he
 
discusses
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
with
 
PUMs.
 
Additionally,
 
he
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
cross-checking
 
documents
 
(like
 
adoption
 
data
 
and
 
RIR)
 
to
 
ensure
 
their
 
accuracy
 
and
 
completeness
 
before
 
they
 
are
 
submitted
 
to
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
or
 
other
 
stakeholders.
 
He
 
also
 
oversees
 
capacity-building
 
efforts,
 
planning
 
and
 
organizing
 
training
 
sessions
 
for
 
staff
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
skills
 
and
 
effectiveness.
 
 
On
 
the
 
technical
 
side,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
plays
 
a
 
key
 
role
 
in
 
planning
 
and
 
conducting
 
Training
 
of
 
Trainers
 
(TOT)
 
sessions
 
for
 
PUMs
 
and
 
FFs,
 
ensuring
 
they
 
are
 
well-equipped
 
to
 
educate
 
farmers.
 
He
 
does
 
not
 
deliver
 
any
 
direct
 
training
 
to
 
the
 
farmers.
 
He
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
developing
 
training
 
materials,
 
including
 
translating
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
principles
 
and
 
other
 
project-related
 
content
 
into
 
the
 
local
 
language
 
to
 
make
 
them
 
more
 
accessible.
 
Satish
 
also
 
plans
 
and
 
implements
 
training
 
programs
 
for
 
PUMs
 
and
 
FFs,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
content
 
is
 
contextually
 
relevant.
 
His
 
technical
 
responsibilities
 
extend
 
to
 
supporting
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
licensing
 
assessments,
 
where
 
he
 
ensures
 
that
 
WWF’s
 
implementation
 
aligns
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
He
 
also
 
develops
 
and
 
oversees
 
corrective
 
action
 
plans
 
as
 
needed,
 
reviews
 
project
 
activities,
 
analyzes
 
results,
 
and
 
establishes
 
detailed
 
monitoring
 
protocols
 
for
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
project,
 
such
 
as
 
FFBs
 
and
 
RIR.
 
 
In
 
his
 
role,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
allocates
 
approximately
 
20%
 
of
 
his
 
time
 
to
 
administrative
 
tasks.

which
 
includes
 
overseeing

takes
 
up
 
25-30%
 
of
 
his
 
time.
 
Training
 
and
 
capacity

also
 
consume
 
35%

community-level
 
activities
 
account
 
for
 
5%
 
-
 
10%.
 
 
Greater

should
 
be
 
placed
 
on

We
 
have
 
an

alone
 
ﬁlling
 
up
 
1
 
TB

For
 
years,
 
I
 
have
  
consistently
 
provided
 
feedback,
 
in
 
the
 
self-assessment
 
reports,
 
that
 
the
 
data
 
burden
 
on
 
PUMs
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
reduced,
 
allowing
 
them
 
to
 
focus
 
more
 
on
 
ﬁeldwork.&quot;

coordinator
 
believes
 
that
 
direct
 
engagement
 
with
 
ﬁeldwork
 
and
 
capacity
 
building
 
is
 
more
 
beneﬁcial
 
for
 
farmers
 
than
 
data
 
management
.
 
He
 
has
 
previously
 
discussed
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
the
 
21
 


 
excessive
 
level
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
required,
 
noting
 
that
 
the
 
data
 
burden
 
has
 
decreased
 
signiﬁcantly
 
compared
 
to
 
previous
 
years.
 
Now,
 
only
 
15%
 
of
 
farmers
 
in
 
a
 
PU
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
maintain
 
FFBs,
 
with
 
the
 
rest
 
participating
 
voluntarily.
 
Overall,
 
his
 
preference
 
is
 
to
 
devote
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
training
 
and
 
ﬁeldwork
 
rather
 
than
 
being
 
overwhelmed
 
by
 
data
 
tasks.
 
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
among
 
FFs,
 
PUM,
 
and
 
the
 
Project
 
Coordinator
 
to
 
allocate
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
impactful
 
work,
 
such
 
as
 
capacity
 
building,
 
rather
 
than
 
spending
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
on
 
data
 
entry
 
and
 
administrative
 
tasks.
 
By
 
focusing
 
more
 
on
 
these
 
meaningful
 
activities,
 
the
 
FFs
 
and
 
PUMs
 
can
 
engage
 
more
 
closely
 
with
 
farmers,
 
which
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
deepen
 
the
 
existing
 
relationships
 
but
 
also
 
attract
 
greater
 
interest
 
from
 
non-program
 
farmers,
 
encouraging
 
them,
 
especially
 
women,
 
to
 
join
 
the

farmers
 
have

the

FFs
 
from
 
both
 
the
 
established
 
INTL01/02
 
and
 
the
 
newer
 
INTL23
 
provide
 
training
 
on
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
topics.
 
These
 
include
 
the
 
use
 
of

proper
 
handling
 
and
 
application
 
of
 
PPE

as

and

All
 
the

reported
 
following
 
the

practices
 
diligently.
  
 
 
Elaborating
 
on
 
the
 
program’s
 
reach
 
towards
 
women
 
program
 
farmers,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
women's
 
participation
 
as
 
program
 
farmers
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
is
 
extremely
 
low
 
at
 
present.
 
Although
 
a
 
typical
 
PU
 
includes
 
around
 
3000-3500
 
farmers,
 
~98%
 
are
 
men,
 
with
 
women
 
making
 
up
 
only
 
about
 
~2%-3%
 
of
 
the
 
cohort.
 
Field
 
observations
 
too
 
pointed
 
towards
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
women
 
participation
 
was
 
less
 
and
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
always
 
occupied
 
with
 
domestic
 
work
 
such
 
as
 
cooking,
 
cleaning
 
or
 
taking
 
care
 
of
 
children.
 
Interviews
 
revealed
 
that
 
women
 
struggle
 
to
 
balance
 
household
 
chores
 
with
 
farming
 
responsibilities,
 
with
 
them
 
naturally
 
opting
 
for
 
the
 
former.

The
 
primary
 
motivation
 
for
 
women
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
was
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
their
 
crops
 
and
 
ﬁnancially
 
support
 
their
 
households,
 
alleviating
 
the
 
ﬁnancial
 
burden
 
on
 
their
 
husbands.
 
Women
 
receive
 
full
 
support
 
from
 
their
 
family
 
to
 
do
 
farming
 
and
 
in
 
fact
 
even
 
take
 
some
 
farm
 
decisions.
 
It
 
was
 
observed
 
that
 
women
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
(old
 
and
 
new)
 
like
 
attending
 
training
 
as
 
the
 
sessions
 
are
 
engaging.
 
Women
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
follow
 
all
 
the
 
practices
 
that
 
are
 
taught
 
to
 
them.
 
Intercropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping
 
is
 
done
 
by
 
women
 
of
 
both
 
of
 
the
 
PUs
 
as
 
well.

When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
facilities
 
provided
 
during
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training,
 
the
 
women
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
provided
 
with
 
chairs,
 
water,
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
toilets.
 
Both
 
husbands
 
and
 
wives
 
could
 
speak
 
freely
 
in
 
the
 
meetings,
 
with
 
FFs
 
treating
 
everyone
 
equally
 
and
 
promptly
 
addressing
 
any
 
questions.
 
In
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
program
 
farmers'
 
FGDs
 
conducted,
 
the
 
women
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
INTL02
 
group
 
shared
 
that
 
they
 
pass
 
on
 
the
 
knowledge
 
gained
 
to
 
other
 
non-program
 
farmers,
 
which
 
has
 
helped
 
them
 
understand
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
using
 
organic
 
pesticides.
 
In
 
the
 
newer
 
INTL23,
 
women
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
share
 
or
 
discuss
 
any
 
information
 
learnt
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
with
 
other
 
non
 
program
 
farmers.
 
They
 
mentioned
 
that
 
when
 
they
 
try
 
to
 
share
 
their
 
knowledge
 
with
 
their
 
husbands,
 
they
 
are
 
often
 
dismissed
 
with
 
the
 
remark
 
that
 
the
 
husbands
 
already
 
know.
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
difference
 
observed
 
in
 
the
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
approach
 
of
 
INTL23
 
vis-a-vis
 
the
 
other
 
PUs.
  
Women
 
of
 
INTL23
 
seemed
 
less
 
motivated
 
and
 
not
 
inclined
 
to
 
adopt
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
prior
 
disappointing
 
experience
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
with
 
adoption
 
of
 
organic

conducted,
 
effect
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
on
 
women
 
empowerment,
 
and
 
learnings
 
from
 
training.
 
From
 
the
 
arguments
 
listed
 
below,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
concluded
 
that
 
women
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU,
 
INTL23
 
require
 
more
 
training
 
and
 
handholding
 
support
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
absorb
 
the
 
knowledge
 
shared
 
and
 
implement
 
those
 
practices
 
in
 
their
 
farms
 
thus
 
indicating
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff’s
 
efforts
 
towards
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
(especially
 
of
 
farmers
 
newly
 
joining
 
the
 
program)
 
are
 
necessary
 
and
 
required.
   
 
 
●
 
In
 
INTL02,
 
women
 
have
 
shifted
 
away
 
from
 
chemical
 
pesticides,
 
opting
 
instead
 
for
 
neem
 
oil,
 
vermicompost,
 
and
 
avoiding
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
chemical
 
cocktails
.
 
They
 
are
 
conscious
 
of
 
the
 
detrimental
 
effects
 
chemicals
 
have
 
on
 
both
 
soil
 
health
 
and
 
their
 
own
 
well-being.
 
Previously,
 
26
 


 
when
 
they
 
relied
 
on
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea,
 
DAP,
 
and
 
cocktails,
 
their
 
crops
 
suffered
 
damage.
 
However,
 
since
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
they
 
have
 
transitioned
 
to
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
leading
 
to
 
reduced
 
input
 
costs,
 
increased
 
yields,
 
and
 
consequently
 
higher
 
incomes.
 
●
 
Conversely,
 
while
 
farmers
 
in
 
INTL23
 
also
 
use
 
organic
 
fertilizers
 
such
 
as
 
neem
 
oil,
 
navdhanya,
 
and
 
biopesticides,
 
they
 
continue
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea
 
and
 
potassium,
 
including
 
cocktails.
 
Their
 
past
 
experiences
 
with
 
organic
 
methods
 
have
 
been
 
less
 
favorable,
 
resulting
 
in
 
low
 
trust
 
in
 
these
 
practices.
 
For
 
instance,
 
women
 
reported
 
trying
 
neem
 
oil
 
for
 
pest
 
control
 
but
 
did
 
not
 
achieve
 
the
 
desired
 
results.
 
 
●
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL02
 
reported
 
that
 
soil
 
tests
 
were
 
done
 
free
 
of
 
cost
 
for
 
them
 
and
 
the
 
results,
 
which
 
came
 
after
 
15
 
days,
 
helped
 
them
 
decide
 
which
 
crops
 
to
 
grow.
 
Conversely,
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
reported
 
that
 
no
 
soil
 
testing
 
was
 
done
 
and
 
they
 
felt
 
clueless
 
about
 
what
 
to
 
grow
 
and
 
which
 
fertilizers
 
to
 
use.
 
 
●
 
In
 
both
 
PUs,
 
training
 
sessions
 
have
 
been
 
conducted
 
on
 
schedule,
 
with
 
women
 
actively
 
participating.
 
In
 
INTL23,
 
three
 
training
 
sessions
 
for
 
women
 
and
 
two
 
seasonal
 
training
 
sessions
 
for
 
men
 
have
 
been
 
held
 
as
 
of
 
July
 
2024,
 
while
 
in
 
INTL02,
 
3
 
to
 
5
 
training
 
sessions
 
have
 
taken
 
place.
 
However,
 
in
 
INTL23,
 
no
 
demonstrations
 
or
 
rallies
 
have
 
been
 
organized
 
for
 
women,
 
whereas
 
men
 
have
 
attended
 
demonstrations
 
on
 
intercropping,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
navdhanya,
 
and
 
other
 
practices.
 
This
 
may
 
be
 
because
 
the
 
women
 
of
 
INTL23
 
are
 
only
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
evenings
 
or
 
at
 
night
 
when
 
their
 
household
 
chores
 
are
 
done.
 
In
 
fact,
 
they
 
have
 
suggested
 
scheduling
 
training
 
during
 
these
 
times
 
to
 
better
 
accommodate
 
their
 
availability.
 
 
●
 
Women
 
of
 
INTL02
 
reported
 
that
 
after
 
being
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
husbands
 
have
 
been
 
more
 
open
 
about
 
women
 
attending
 
training
 
sessions
 
or
 
venturing
 
outside
 
the
 
house
 
whereas
 
in
 
INTL23
 
women
 
saw
 
no
 
such
 
differences
 
in
 
agency.
 
●
 
When
 
program
 
farmers
 
were
 
asked
 
to
 
rate
 
the
 
extent
 
to
 
which
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
contributed
 
to
 
their
 
knowledge
 
and
 
awareness,
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL02
12
 
rated
 
it
 
as
 
‘Medium.’
 
They
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
enjoy
 
attending
 
the
 
trainings
 
and
 
appreciate
 
the
 
interactive
 
format,
 
which
 
keeps
 
them
 
engaged.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL23
 
rated
 
the
 
impact
 
as
 
‘Low,’
 
expressing
 
that
 
the
 
sessions
 
do
 
not
 
offer
 
any
 
new
 
or
 
signiﬁcant
 
information.
 
They
 
also
 
found
 
the
 
meetings
 
to
 
be
 
lengthy
 
and
 
time-consuming,
 
making
 
it
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
stay
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
duration
 
due
 
to
 
their
 
responsibilities
 
at
 
home
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁelds.
 
They
 
suggested
 
shortening
 
the
 
meetings
 
to
 
around
 
30
 
minutes.
 
 
 
Changes
 
in
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitude,
 
and
 
Practices
 
(KAP)
 
Related
 
to
 
Cotton
 
Farming
 
Farmers
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
have
 
experienced
 
changes
 
in
 
their
 
knowledge,
 
attitudes,
 
and
 
practices
 
related
 
to
 
cotton
 
farming.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL02,
 
have
 
greatly
 
reduced
 
their
 
use
 
of
 
heavy
 
chemicals,
 
recognizing
 
the
 
associated
 
health
 
risks.
 
This
 
awareness
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
both
 
yield
 
and
 
crop
 
quality,
 
with
 
market
 
rates
 
for
 
their
 
produce
 
rising
 
dramatically
 
from
 
Rs.
 
1,500
 
to
 
Rs.
 
1,800
 
per
 
quintal
 
before
 
the
 
program
 
to
 
Rs.
 
7,500
 
per
 
quintal
 
after
 
joining.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23,
 
too,
 
use
 
only
 
‘green
 
color
13
’
 
marked
 
pesticides.
 
 
 
The
 
adoption
 
of
 
intercropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping,
 
such
 
as
 
planting
 
yellow
 
gram,
 
has
 
become
 
common
 
practice
 
among
 
farmers,
 
optimizing
 
land
 
use
 
and
 
improving
 
crop
 
diversity.
 
Additionally,
 
13
Pesticides
 
are
 
classiﬁed
 
by
 
toxicity
 
level
 
using
 
a
 
color
 
code,
  
Red:
 
Extremely
 
toxic,
 
Yellow:
 
Highly
 
toxic,
  
Blue:
 
Moderately
 
toxic,
 
Green:
 
Less
 
toxic.
 
 
12
Farmers
 
were
 
chosen
 
either
 
from
 
INTL01
 
or
 
02
 
for
 
this
 
KPI.
 
Program
 
female
 
farmers
 
from
 
Bheempelli
 
village
 
of
 
INTL02
  
were
 
randomly
 
selected
 
for
 
this
 
discussion.
 
Respondents
 
from
 
INTL01
 
were
 
not
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
sample.
 
 
27
 


 
they
 
have
 
started
 
growing
 
two
 
crops
 
annually—cotton
 
and
 
vegetables—allowing
 
them
 
to
 
supplement
 
their
 
household
 
diet
 
and
 
reduce
 
expenses.
 
 
A
 
notable
 
shift
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
increased
 
adoption
 
of
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
reﬂecting
 
a
 
growing
 
emphasis
 
on
 
health
 
and
 
safety,
 
in
 
both
 
the
 
PUs.
 
This
 
improved
 
awareness
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
occupational
 
safety
 
and
 
health
 
(OSH)
 
along
 
with
 
an
 
increased
 
yield
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
adopting
 
the
 
program
 
promoted
 
approaches,
 
have
 
contributed
 
to
 
higher
 
ﬁnancial
 
returns
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
leading
 
to
 
an
 
enhancement
 
in
 
their
 
standard
 
of
 
living.
 
Many
 
women
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
purchase
 
items
 
like
 
TVs,
 
refrigerators,
 
bikes,
 
and
 
even
 
tractors.
 
However,
 
this
 
improvement
 
in
 
lifestyle
 
was
 
reported
 
only
 
by
 
the
 
INTL02
 
women
 
farmers.

Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL02
 
are
 
now
 
making
 
a
 
proﬁt
 
of
 
Rs.
 
20,000
 
to
 
Rs.
 
30,000
 
per
 
acre
 
per
 
season,
 
with
 
overall
 
expenditures
 
decreasing.
 
Over
 
the
 
past
 
ﬁve
 
years,
 
they
 
have
 
transitioned
 
from
 
using
 
harmful
 
pesticides
 
like
 
urea,
 
DAP,
 
and
 
chemical
 
cocktails
 
to
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
which
 
has
 
increased
 
their
 
income
 
while
 
reducing
 
fertilizer
 
costs.
 
This
 
comprehensive
 
shift
 
in
 
farming
 
practices
 
demonstrates
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
on
 
their
 
lives.
 
Non-program
 
farmers
 
(female)
 
Out
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
non
 
program
 
farmers
 
FGD
 
that
 
were
 
conducted
 
-
 
women
 
from
 
INTL01
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
attended
 
any
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
While
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand
 
two
 
out
 
of
 
eight
 
women
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
attended
 
ﬁve
 
to
 
six
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
trainings
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
Women
 
who
 
could
 
not
 
attend
 
cited
 
reasons
 
like
 
either
 
tending
 
to
 
household
 
chores
 
or
 
training
 
timings
 
clashing
 
with
 
farm
 
timings.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
unanimously
 
agreed
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
provided
 
the
 
trainings
 
are
 
held
 
at
 
a
 
convenient

Currently
 
the
 
trainings
 
are
 
not
 
held
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
when
 
they
 
are
 
available
 
and
 
therefore
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
attend
 
or
 
show
 
any
 
interest.
 
In
 
addition,
 
the
 
women
 
spoke
 
of
 
their
 
preference
 
for
 
separate
 
women-only
 
meetings
 
rather
 
than
 
mixed
 
meetings.
 
They
 
cited
 
uneasiness
 
and
 
uncomfort
 
with
 
male
 
participants
 
who
 
are
 
usually
 
intoxicated
 
by
 
the

28
 


 
Women
 
from
 
both
 
PUs
 
(old
 
and
 
new)
 
were
 
aware
 
of
 
important
 
practices,
 
such
 
as
 
avoiding
 
child
 
labor,
 
using
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
adopting
 
organic
 
methods
 
like
 
applying
 
sheep
 
and
 
cow
 
dung,
 
practicing
 
intercropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping,
 
and
 
avoiding
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
'red
 
color'
 
coded
 
(i.e.
 
harmful)
 
pesticides.
 
However,
 
they
 
were
 
unaware
 
of
 
pheromone
 
traps
 
and
 
relied
 
heavily
 
on
 
chemicals
 
for
 
their
 
farms.
 
When
 
asked
 
what
 
they
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
they
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
methods
 
of
 
growing
 
cotton
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
good
 
quality
 
crop.
  
 
 
However,
 
clear
 
differences
 
between
 
program
 
and
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
were
 
evident.
 
Non-program
 
farmers
 
admitted
 
to
 
using
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea,
 
DAP,
 
potassium,
 
and
 
chemical
 
cocktails,
 
while
 
program
 
farmers
 
demonstrated
 
awareness
 
of
 
the
 
environmental
 
harm
 
caused
 
by
 
such
 
pesticides.
 
Additionally,
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
were
 
less
 
familiar
 
with
 
practices
 
like
 
using
 
pheromone
 
traps.
 
A
 
signiﬁcant
 
difference
 
observed
 
from
 
a
 
gender
 
perspective
 
was
 
that
 
non-program
 
women
 
farmers
 
were
 
less
 
informed
 
about
 
farm
 
activities,
 
including
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
pesticides,
 
and
 
indicated
 
that
 
decision-making
 
was
 
primarily
 
handled
 
by
 
their
 
husbands.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
women
 
who
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
demonstrated
 
greater
 
independence,
 
actively
 
participating
 
in
 
decision-making
 
and
 
being
 
more
 
involved
 
in
 
farm
 
management.
 
 
 
Overall,
 
non-program
 
women
 
farmers
 
explicitly
 
expressed
 
interest
 
in
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
program,
 
however
 
with
 
the
 
condition
 
that
 
the
 
meetings
 
take
 
place
 
at
 
a
 
convenient
 
time.

adds
 
to
 
their
 
knowledge
 
plus
 
they
 
get
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
other
 
farmers.
 
A
 
group
 
of
 
co-farmers
 
informed
 
that
 
till
 
date,
 
they
 
have
 
learnt
 
about
 
safety
 
and
 
precautionary
 
measures
 
like
 
using
 
gloves,
 
mask
 
and
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
inter
 
cropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping
 
in
 
the
 
training.
 
The
 
co-farmers
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
did
 
not
 
ﬁnd
 
any
 
difference
 
in
 
the
 
way
 
the
 
FFs
 
engaged
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
farmers
 
and
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
and
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
FFs
 
are
 
very
 
proactive
 
in
 
addressing
 
their
 
queries.
 
They
 
informed
 
that
 
farmers
 
are
 
provided
 
with
 
chairs,
 
and
 
water
 
during
 
the
 
training.
 
Typically,
 
both
 
husband
 
and
 
wife
 
attend
 
the
 
meetings,
 
with
 
time
 
and
 
travel
 
distance
 
being
 
the
 
key
 
factors
 
inﬂuencing
 
their
 
decision
 
to
 
attend
 
the
 
training.
 
Co-farmers
 
reported
 
that
 
whatever
 
they
 
learn
 
in

The
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
is
 
evident
 
in
 
several
 
key
 
changes
 
reported
 
by
 
the
 
women:
 
●
 
Before
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
they
 
were
 
unaware
 
of
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
wearing
 
gloves,
 
a
 
practice
 
they
 
have
 
since
 
adopted.
 
 
●
 
The
 
program
 
also
 
shifted
 
their
 
approach
 
to
 
farming,
 
moving
 
them
 
away
 
from
 
using
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea
 
to
 
more
 
sustainable
 
alternatives
 
such
 
as
 
compost
 
and
 
neem
 
oil.
 
They
 
noted
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
used
 
chemical
 
cocktails
 
for
 
the
 
past
 
3-4
 
years,
 
reﬂecting
 
the
 
long-term
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
training
.
 
 
●
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
farmers
 
have
 
experienced
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
ﬁeld
 
investment
 
costs.
 
They
 
attribute
 
these
 
savings
 
to
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
a
 
practice
 
strongly
 
encouraged
 
by
 
the
 
FFs,
 
which
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
lower
 
overall
 
expenses
 
compared
 
to
 
their
 
practices
 
before
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.

It
 
was
 
observed
 
that
 
generally
 
women
 
are
 
the
 
only
 
ones
 
who
 
tend
 
to
 
share
 
info
 
with
 
their
 
male
 
counterparts
 
or
 
other
 
female
 
farmers.
  
In
 
some
 
PUs
 
we
 
saw
 
the
 
active
 
participation
 
of
 
both
 
male
 
and
 
females
 
(especially
 
in
 
Bheempelli)
 
-
 
there
 
was
 
interaction
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
and
 
they
 
took
 
decisions
 
together.
 
30
 


 
Over
 
the
 
past
 
few
 
years,
 
there
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
noticeable
 
increase
 
in
 
women’s
 
participation
 
in
 
meetings.
 
Previously,
 
their
 
husbands
 
were
 
reluctant
 
to
 
listen
 
to
 
their
 
input,
 
but
 
the
 
training
 
has
 
given
 
these
 
women
 
a
 
stronger
 
voice
 
and
 
inﬂuence
 
in
 
decision-making.
 
As
 
their
 
knowledge
 
has
 
grown,
 
so
 
has
 
their
 
authority
 
and
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
expressing
 
their
 
opinions.
 
This
 
was
 
reported
 
by
 
the
 
farmers
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs.
 
 
Co-farmers
 
of
 
INTL02
 
reported
 
gaining
 
greater
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence;
 
they
 
now
 
earn
 
their
 
own
 
money
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
depend
 
on
 
their
 
husbands
 
for
 
monetary
 
assistance.
 
This
 
newfound
 
autonomy
 
has
 
resulted
 
from
 
an
 
increased
 
participation
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
in
 
various
 
programs
 
organized
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
in
 
self-help
 
groups
 
and
 
focused
 
attempts
 
by
 
the
 
FF’s
 
in
 
engaging
 
speciﬁcally
 
with
 
the
 
Co-farmers
 
towards
 
enhancing
 
their
 
knowledge
 
along
 
with
 
their
 
socio-economic
 
empowerment,
 
has
 
contributed
 
to
 
an
 
overall
 
sense
 
of
 
empowerment
 
among
 
the
 
women.
 
They
 
particularly
 
appreciated
 
learning
 
about
 
intercropping
 
and
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
further
 
reinforcing
 
their
 
active
 
role
 
in
 
farming
 
and
 
decision-making.
 
Co-farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
take
 
help
 
of
 
children
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
during
 
holidays
 
for
 
simple
 
ﬁeld
 
tasks
 
(not
 
any
 
hazardous
 
activity)
 
and
 
that
 
they
 
ensure
 
that
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
hinder
 
their
 
education.
 
 
 
Thus,
 
program
 
farmers
 
have
 
found
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training
 
sessions
 
highly
 
impactful,
 
actively
 
applying
 
what
 
they
 
learn
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
farming
 
practices,
 
with
 
women
 
particularly
 
valuing
 
the
 
interactive
 
and
 
engaging
 
nature
 
of
 
these
 
sessions.
 
Meanwhile,
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
and
 
co-farmers
 
have
 
shown
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
eager
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
methods
 
for
 
improving
 
their
 
crop
 
quality.
 
Many
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
expressed
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training
 
sessions
 
if
 
they
 
were
 
held
 
at
 
more
 
convenient
 
times,
 
highlighting
 
their
 
enthusiasm
 
to
 
gain
 
new
 
knowledge
 
and
 
practices.
 
Co-farmers
 
have
 
also
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
enjoy
 
attending
 
these
 
sessions,
 
appreciating
 
both
 
the
 
knowledge
 
gained
 
and
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
other
 
farmers.

sessions
 
and
 
the
 
subsequent
 
change
 
in
 
knowledge,
 
attitude
 
and
 
practices
 
of
 
the
 
farmers.
 
While
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
(INTL01
 
and
 
INTL02)
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
had

in
 
the

informed
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
attended
 
3
 
such
 
trainings
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
season.
  
When
 
the

42,

and
 
39
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL01,
 
32
 


 
02
 
and
 
23
 
were
 
enquired
 
about
 
the
 
concepts
 
that
 
they
 
learned
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions,
 
the
 
majority
 
indicated
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
learned
 
about
 
crop
 
rotation,
 
application
 
of
 
organic
 
manures,
 
conducting
 
soil
 
tests
 
and
 
installing
 
traps
 
in
 
the
 
trainings
.
 
Having
 
been
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
for
 
a
 
longer
 
duration,
 
a
 
higher
 
percentage
 
of
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
producer
 
units
 
(INTL01
 
and
 
02)
 
mentioned
 
learning
 
about
 
more
 
topics
 
concerning
 
sustainable
 
cotton
 
production
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
new
 
PU
 
(INTL23).
 
 
 
The
 
extent
 
of
 
adoption
 
of

is
 
also
 
relatively
 
higher
 
in
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the

This
 
data
 
corroborates
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
a
 
higher

is
 
required
 
in
 
educating
 
farmers
 
newly

there
 
(indicating
 
the
 
necessity
 
of
 
sufﬁcient
 
time
 
required
 
for
 
behavioral
 
change).
 
However
 
for
 
some
 
indicators,
 
such
 
as
 
growing
 
refuge
 
crops,
 
selecting
 
quality
 
seeds
 
and
 
plowing
 
across
 
the
 
slope
 
-
 
the
 
reported
 
adoption
 
of
 
practices
 
is
 
higher
 
than
 
their
 
knowledge.
 
These
 
anomalies
 
could
 
be
 
due
 
to
 
chance
 
or
 
also
 
due
 
to
 
unintended
 
biases
 
in
 
sampling
 
or
 
interpretation
 
of
 
questions
 
by
 
the
 
data
 
collector/respondent.
     
 
The
 
farmers
 
also
 
revealed
 
learning
 
about
 
topics
 
such
 
as
 
proper
 
fertilizer
 
usage,
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
wearing
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
and
 
avoiding
 
harmful
 
pesticides
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions.
 
Farmers
 
from
 
INTL01
 
unanimously
 
agreed
 
that
 
videos
 
are
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
medium
 
for
 
learning
 
new
 
farming
 
techniques
 
and
 
concepts.
 
They
 
also
 
appreciated
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
are
 
held
 
at
 
convenient
 
locations
 
and
 
times.
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL01
 
do
 
not
 
practice
 
child
 
labour
 
as
 
they
 
want
 
their
 
children
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
education.
 
 
In
 
contrast
 
to
 
the
 
positive
 
attitudes
 
and
 
practices
 
of
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PU,
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL23
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
wear
 
PPE
 
kits
 
regularly
 
leading
 
to
 
health
 
issues.
 
Program
 
farmers
 
in
 
INTL23
 
further
 
stated
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
the
 
primary
 
decision-makers
 
and
 
consider
 
the
 
input
 
of
 
only
 
those
 
women
 
they
 
believe
 
to
 
be
 
knowledgeable.
 
They
 
also
 
acknowledged
 
that
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
has
 
empowered
 
female
 
farmers,
 
enhancing
 
their
 
knowledge
 
and
 
thereby
 
increasing
 
their
 
inﬂuence
 
in
 
decision-making
 
processes.
 
 
Farmers
 
who
 
joined
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
later
 
shared
 
that
 
their
 
decision
 
was
 
inﬂuenced
 
by
 
observing
 
the
 
progress
 
of
 
existing
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
particularly
 
in
 
reducing
 
pesticide
 
use,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
by
 
the
 
impactful
 
rallies
 
and
 
videos.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
both
 
co-farmers
 
and
 
other
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
have
 
become
 
increasingly
 
interested
 
in
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
When
 
asked
 
why
 
some
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
remain
 
uninterested,
 
the
 
farmers
 
explained
 
that
 
they
 
tend
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
rigid
 
mindset
 
and
 
are
 
generally
 
resistant
 
to
 
joining
 
any
 
programs.
 
 
More
 
than
 
70%
 
of
 
the
 
farmers
 
surveyed
 
from
 
all
 
the
 
3
 
PUs
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
happy
 
with
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
sessions.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
that
 
they
 
like
 
the
 
most,
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
told
 
of
 
getting
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
topics
 
(94%),
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
teaching
 
approach
 
of
 
the
 
facilitator
 
(72%),
 
handholding

provided
 
in
 
adoption
 
of

(61%)
 
and
 
going

(91%).
 
Responses
 
of
 
farmers
 
from
 
the

(INTL23)
 
are
 
about
 
10%

the
 
older
 
PU
 
farmers
 
when
 
enquired
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
aspects
 
of
 
training
 
that
 
they
 
like.
 
 
More
 
than
 
70%
 
farmers
 
from
 
all
 
3
 
PUs
 
indicated
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
such
 
aspects
 
of
 
the

program
 
that
 
they
 
dislike,
 
however
 
a
 
smaller
 
percentage
 
of
 
farmers
 
did
 
mention
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
sessions
 
and
 
strict
 
adherence
 
to
 
program
 
practices
 
being
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
an
 
issue.
 
Higher
 
yield
 
and
 
improved
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton
 
were
 
the
 
main
 
beneﬁts
 
that
 
about
 
86%
 
and
 
57%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the

PUs
 
reported
 
from
 
being
 
a

of
 
the
 
Better

program
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
50%
 
and
 
20%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU.
 
Further,
 
more
 
than
 
80%
 
farmers
 
from
 
all
 
the
 
3
 
PUs
 
said
 
that
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
learn
 
improved
 
farming
 
techniques,
 
potential
 
increase
 
in
 
income
 
and
 
improvement
 
in
 
soil
 
health
 
are
 
35
 


 
the

that
 
motivated
 
them

About
 
25%
 
of
 
the

from
 
the
 
3
 
PUs
 
stated
 
that
 
lack
 
of

is
 
a
 
major

that
 
they
 
face
 
in

sessions.
 
Again,
 
more
 
than
 
85%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the

(INTL01

that
 
the

When
 
questioned
 
on
 
the
 
spillover
 
effects,
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older

spoke
 
of
 
better

better

thus
 
enhancement
 
of
 
self-belief
 
as
 
the

that

Responses
 
to
 
all
 
these

are
 
slightly
 
on

for
 
INTL23

clearly
 
indicating
 
a

of

and
 
facilitation
 
support
 
required
 
by
 
the

from

Differences
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
PUs
 
were
 
observed
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
women
 
participation
 
in

and
 
interest
 
in
 
maintaining
 
FFBs.
 
 
 
●
 
In
 
INTL01,
 
women's
 
participation
 
is
 
notably
 
low.
 
Out
 
of
 
the
 
130
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
in
 
a
 
village,
 
only
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
are
 
women
 
with
 
them
 
primarily
 
joining
 
the
 
program
 
after
 
the
 
recent
 
passing
 
of
 
their
 
husbands.
 
Despite
 
this,
 
these
 
women
 
actively
 
engage
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
and
 
also
 
participate
 
in
 
rallies.
 
Participation
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
INTL23
 
is
 
also
 
low
 
but
 
they
 
rarely
 
attend
 
meetings
 
due
 
to
 
their
 
commitments
 
to
 
domestic
 
and
 
agricultural
 
work.
 
 
●
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL01
 
showed
 
a
 
liking
 
and
 
interest
 
towards
 
maintaining
 
FFBs.
 
They
 
ﬁll
 
it
 
diligently,
 
either
 
themselves
 
or
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
their
 
children,
 
and
 
feel
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
useful
 
to
 
36
 


 
document
 
their
 
expenses.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
them
 
do
 
not
 
maintain

Changes
 
in
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitude,
 
and
 
Practices
 
(KAP)
 
Related
 
to
 
Cotton
 
Farming
 
●
 
Previously,
 
farmers
 
relied
 
heavily
 
on
 
Monocrotophos
 
and
 
a
 
cocktail
 
of
 
harmful
 
chemicals,
 
spending
 
substantial
 
amounts
 
on
 
pesticides
 
but
 
achieving
 
very
 
poor
 
crop
 
yields.
 
Through
 
the
 
guidance
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff,
 
they
 
learned
 
to
 
not
 
indulge
 
in
 
such
 
hazardous
 
practices.
 
●
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
their
 
costs
 
have
 
decreased,
 
and
 
crop
 
yields
 
have
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improved,
 
leading
 
to
 
better
 
prices
 
in
 
the
 
market
.
 
While
 
farmers
 
once
 
faced
 
losses,
 
the
 
regular
 
support
 
and
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
program
 
staff
 
Ms.
 
Damayanthi
 
and
 
Ms.
 
Sony
 
have
 
enabled
 
them
 
to
 
conduct
 
soil
 
tests.
 
●
 
They
 
have
 
also
 
started
 
planting
 
green
 
grams
 
and
 
black
 
grams
 
as
 
intercrops
 
using
 
organic
 
fertilizers
 
produced
 
domestically
,
 
such
 
as
 
those
 
made
 
from
 
neem
 
trees.
 
Previously,
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
guidance
 
on
 
these
 
practices.
 
Now,
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
visits
 
and
 
meetings,
 
farmers
 
are
 
using
 
fewer
 
pesticides,
 
cultivating
 
intercrops,
 
and
 
improving
 
overall
 
soil
 
and
 
plant
 
health.
 
●
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL01,
 
reported
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
farmers
 
has
 
improved
 
since
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
—they
 
have
 
purchased
 
chairs
 
for
 
their
 
homes,
 
educated
 
their
 
children,
 
and
 
upgraded
 
their
 
homes
 
from
 
Kaccha
 
(non-durable)
 
to
 
Pakka
 
(durable)
 
houses.
 
●
 
The
 
use
 
of
 
machinery
 
has
 
also
 
increased,
 
reducing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
manual
 
labor.
 
This
 
includes
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
tractors,
 
harvesting
 
machines,
 
and
 
even
 
cotton-removing
 
machines.
 
Farmers
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
mentioned
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
free
 
or
 
subsidized
 
PPE
 
kits.
 
Farmers
 
from
 
INTL23
 
have
 
expressed
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
enhanced
 
audio-visual
 
training
 
tools
 
and
 
improved
 
safety
 
materials
.
 
While
 
there
 
is
 
overall
 
satisfaction
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
some
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
noted
 
that
 
not
 
all
 
recommended
 
practices
 
are
 
consistently
 
followed,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
PPE
 
kits.
 
Perspectives
 
of
 
Lead
 
Farmers
 
The
 
lead
 
farmer
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
educating
 
fellow
 
farmers
 
on
 
various
 
sustainable
 
agricultural
 
practices.
 
This
 
includes
 
teaching
 
about
 
bio-pesticides
 
(green
 
and
 
blue),
 
stem
 
applications,
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
intercropping
 
(with
 
crops
 
like
 
red
 
gram
 
and
 
green
 
gram),
 
pest
 
management,
 
and
 
border
 
crops.
 
They
 
advise
 
against
 
harmful
 
pesticides
 
like
 
Monocrotophos
 
and
 
promote
 
safer
 
alternatives.
 
The
 
lead
 
farmer
 
also
 
provides
 
guidance
 
on
 
precautions
 
related
 
to
 
water
 
resources,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
bio-fertilizers,
 
and
 
efﬁcient
 
crop
 
watering
 
methods,
 
such
 
as
 
alternating
 
the
 
watering
 
of
 
plant
 
rows.
 
Additionally,
 
they
 
emphasize
 
safety
 
measures,
 
such
 
as
 
wearing
 
gloves
 
and
 
masks
 
during
 
pesticide
 
application,
 
and
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
pheromone
 
traps.
 
 
Both
 
the
 
lead
 
farmers
 
interviewed
 
shared
 
the
 
common
 
goal
 
of
 
wanting
 
to
 
educate
 
their
 
fellow
 
farmers
 
on
 
best
 
practices
 
and
 
ensuring
 
that
 
they
 
also
 
beneﬁt
 
from
 
lower
 
investment
 
costs
 
and
 
higher
 
proﬁts,
 
just
 
like
 
they
 
did.

practices.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
the

Farmers
 
from
 
both
 
the

expressed
 
a
 
liking
 
towards
 
maintaining
 
FFBs
 
as
 
it
 
helps
 
them
 
track
 
their
 
expenses
 
and
 
income.
 
Interest
 
of
 
non
 
program
 
farmers
 
in

Farmers
 
are
 
highly
 
receptive
 
to
 
their
 
lead
 
farmers’
 
guidance
 
and
 
consistently
 
follow
 
their
 
advice.
 
In
 
INTL23,
 
even
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
are
 
actively

in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
and
 
have
 
expressed
 
interest
 
in
 
joining
 
the
 
Better

program,
 
demonstrating
 
its
 
wider
 
appeal

inﬂuence.
 
Both
 
lead
 
farmers
 
actively
 
engage
 
with
 
non-program
 
farmers,
 
encouraging
 
them

themselves
 
often
 
discuss
 
the
 
beneﬁts
 
and
 
drawbacks
 
of
 
new
 
methods
 
they
 
have
 
learned.
 
However,
 
the
 
lead

from
 
INTL02
 
noted
 
that
 
some
 
farmers
 
are
 
hesitant
 
to
 
join
 
the

due
 
to
 
concerns
 
about
 
attending

dealing
 
with
 
extensive

The

associated
 
with

farming.
 
Men
 
are
 
paid
 
higher
 
rates
 
than
 
women
 
simply
 
because
 
the
 
work
 
they
 
do
 
is
 
physically
 
demanding
 
or
 
hazardous
 
like
 
carrying
 
cotton
 
bags,
 
plowing
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
or
 
spraying
 
pesticides
 
while
 
women
 
are
 
generally
 
involved
 
in
 
weeding
 
and
 
cotton
 
plucking.
 
These
 
rates
 
increase
 
during
 
peak
 
seasons.
  
 
 
Following
 
are
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
challenges
 
mentioned
 
by
 
lead
 
farmer
 
of
 
INTL23:
 
 
●
 
The
 
biggest
 
challenge
 
they
 
face
 
is
 
the
 
pink
 
bollworm,
 
which
 
signiﬁcantly
 
impacts
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton.
 
While
 
using
 
pheromone
 
traps
 
has
 
helped
 
somewhat,
 
the
 
problem
 
persists
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
effective
 
pesticide
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
to
 
combat
 
bollworms.
 
●
 
The
 
ﬂuctuating
 
prices
 
of
 
cotton
 
remain
 
a
 
major
 
concern.
 
●
 
The
 
government
 
usually
 
provides
 
red
 
gram
 
and
 
green
 
gram
 
seeds
 
free
 
of
 
cost,
 
but
 
it
 
wasn’t
 
done
 
this
 
time.
 
Impact
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
 
Since
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
farmers
 
(especially
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs)
 
mentioned
 
that
 
their
 
yield
 
per
 
acre
 
has
 
increased
 
noticeably.
 
Previously,
 
farmers
 
focused
 
solely
 
on
 
growing
 
cotton
 
throughout
 
the
 
year,
 
but
 
now,
 
they
 
have
 
diversiﬁed
 
their
 
crops
 
to
 
include
 
maize
 
and
 
yellow
 
gram
 
as
 
border
 
crops
 
as
 
well.
 
This
 
diversiﬁcation
 
has
 
not
 
only
 
boosted
 
overall
 
yields
 
but
 
has
 
also
 
allowed
 
for
 
intercropping
 
of
 
pulses.
 
These
 
pulses
 
are
 
used
 
for
 
household
 
meals,
 
leading
 
to
 
additional
 
savings
 
by
 
reducing
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
purchase
 
them
 
from
 
the
 
market.
 
Additional
 
remarks
 
on
 
the
 
social
 
structure
 
observed
 
during
 
trainings/meetings
 
of
 
the
 
learning
 
groups
 
as
 
inferred
 
from
 
interactions
 
with
 
the
 
farmers
 
and
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
have
 
been
 
mentioned
 
in

Based
 
on
 
the

results,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
estimates
 
and
 
declares
 
volumes
 
of
 
cotton
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
eligible
 
for
 
licensing
 
and
 
being
 
taken
 
up
 
in
 
the

chain
 
as
 
‘Better

As
 
represented
 
in
 
the
 
graph
 
below,
 
the
 
volume
 
of
 
cotton
 
licensed
 
as
 
‘Better
 
Cotton’
 
also
 
shows
 
an
 
increasing
 
trend
 
from
 
2021
 
to
 
2023.
 
Since
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
cotton
 
eligible

licensing
 
is
 
decided
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
early

at

the

On
 
the
 
whole,
 
the
 
cotton
 
production
 
landscape
 
in
 
the
 
project
 
area
 
has
 
seen
 
signiﬁcant
 
changes
 
in
 
recent
 
years,
 
with
 
some
 
farmers
 
transitioning
 
to
 
paddy
 
cultivation.
 
This
 
shift
 
is
 
largely
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
growing
 
preference
 
for
 
mechanization,
 
as
 
cotton
 
farming
 
remains
 
labor-intensive
 
in
 
comparison.
 
Despite
 
challenges,
 
there
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
consistent
 
overall
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
area
 
under
 
cotton
 
cultivation,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
volumes
 
harvested
 
and
 
licensed,
 
with
 
the
 
exception
 
of
 
INTL01
 
during
 
the
 
2022-23
 
period.
 
This
 
temporary
 
decrease
 
in
 
INTL01
 
could
 
likely
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
external
 
factors.
   
 
However,
 
the
 
positive
 
trend
 
in
 
other
 
regions
 
highlights
 
the
 
resilience
 
and
 
adaptability
 
of
 
the
 
farming
 
communities,
 
along
 
with
 
an
 
increased
 
number
 
of
 
farmer
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
The
 
increase
 
in
 
licensed
 
cotton
 
volumes
 
over
 
the
 
years
 
is
 
a
 
testament
 
to
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
in
 
optimizing
 
resource
 
utilization
 
and
 
ensuring
 
sustainable
 
practices.
 
This
 
is
 
further
 
expected
 
to
 
rise

the
 
amount
 
of
 
Better

against
 
the
 
current
 
scenario
 
wherein
 
some
 
Ginners
 
spoke
 
of
 
having
 
to
 
mix
 
the
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
variant
 
in
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
the
 
sufﬁcient
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
.
 
Owing
 
to
 
issues
 
with
 
ginner
 
registrations
 
and
 
data
 
entry,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
uptake
 
in
 
the
 
supply
 
chains
 
has
 
seen
 
a
 
drastic
 
decline
 
from
 
2021
 
to
 
2023
 
(with
 
uptake
 
being
 
nil
 
in
 
2022-23
 
and
 
2023-24).
 
Resolution
 
of
 
such
 
issues
 
along
 
with
 
consideration
 
of
 
an
 
entire
 
geographic
 
area
 
as
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
will
 
ensure
 
considerable
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
overall
 
quantity
 
that
 
ginners
 
can
 
easily
 
segregate
 
and
 
process
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
mix
 
it
 
with

the
 
Assurance
 
Coordinator

Veriﬁer.
 
 
Assurance
 
is
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
process,
 
taking
 
place
 
once
 
every
 
3
 
years
 
for
 
each
 
PU,
 
aimed
 
at
 
verifying
 
if
 
PUs
 
are
 
complying
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards
 
of
 
cotton
 
production
.
 
It
 
encompasses
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
activities,
 
including
 
licensing,
 
assessments,
 
and
 
data
 
veriﬁcation,
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
PUs
 
adhere
 
to
 
the
 
established
 
principles
 
and
 
criteria.
 
Under

there
 
are
 
data
 
related
 
compliance
 
requirements
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
licensing
 
of
 
the
 
PUs.
 
These
 
activities
 
are
 
generally
 
time-bound
 
to
 
ensure
 
timely
 
compliance.
 
 
●
 
Deﬁned
 
Compliance
 
Requirements:
 
Within
 
the
 
assurance
 
process,
 
there
 
are
 
data
 
related
 
compliance
 
requirements,
 
for
 
the
 
various
 
lists
 
such
 
as
 
farmers
 
list,
 
adjusted
 
ﬁgures,
 
RIR,

.
 
These

are

to
 
maintaining
 
the

of
 
the

collected.
 
●
 
Licensing
:
 
Assurance
 
activities
 
differ
 
between
 
new
 
and
 
existing
 
PUs.
 
For
 
older
 
PUs,
 
an
 
assessment
 
visit
 
is
 
conducted
 
before
 
granting
 
a
 
license,
 
which
 
is
 
typically
 
valid
 
for
 
three
 
years.
 
Once
 
the
 
license
 
is
 
nearing
 
expiration,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
conducts
 
a
 
re-assessment
 
to
 
renew
 
it.
 
●
 
Surveillance
 
Assessment
:
 
This
 
is
 
conducted
 
for
 
PUs
 
with
 
an
 
active
 
license,
 
particularly
 
when
 
there
 
are
 
changes
 
in
 
farmer
 
participation
 
or
 
if
 
a
 
red
 
ﬂag
 
was
 
raised
 
during
 
previous
 
visits.
 
The
 
surveillance
 
assessment
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
PU
 
continues
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
The
 
data
 
received
 
by
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
team
 
is
 
checked
 
for
 
its
 
quality.
 
Each
 
ﬁle
 
is
 
reviewed
 
for
 
proper
 
formatting,
 
correct
 
units,
 
and

For
 
different
 
data

team
 
performs
 
an
 
initial
 
review
 
to
 
catch
 
any
 
basic
 
errors
 
before
 
their
 
deeper
 
analysis.
 
 
The
 
assurance
 
team
 
comprises
 
two
 
sets
 
of
 
assessors—one
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
from
 
third-party
 
veriﬁers
 
(3PVs).
 
Currently,
 
four
 
organizations
 
are
 
empaneled
 
as
 
3PVs,
 
with
 
assessors
 
like
 
Lalit
 
leading
 
a
 
team
 
of
 
4-5
 
people
 
to
 
conduct
 
these
 
assessments.
 
PUs
 
are
 
notiﬁed
 
one
 
week
 
in
 
advance
 
of
 
an
 
upcoming
 
assessment.
 
A
 
template
 
outlining
 
the
 
requirements
 
is
 
shared,
 
and
 
PUs
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
submit
 
certain
 
documents
 
within
 
three
 
days
 
before
 
the
 
assessment.
 
The
 
third-party
 
veriﬁers
 
are
 
external
 
entities
 
brought
 
in
 
to
 
ensure
 
impartiality
 
and
 
objectivity
 
in
 
the
 
veriﬁcation
 
process.
 
They
 
conduct
 
a
 
thorough
 
review
 
and
 
assessment
 
of
 
activities
 
on
 
the
 
ground
 
within
 
a
 
limited
 
sample
 
size,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
practices
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
align
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
They
 
mainly
 
conduct
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
audits
 
-
 
Licensing
 
audits
 
to
 
assess
 
whether
 
PUs
 
meet
 
the
 
criteria
 
for
 
licensing
 
and
 
Surveillance
 
audits
 
to
 
assess
 
risks
 
and
 
ensure
 
that
 
PUs
 
continue
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards
 
over
 
time.

typically
 
spanning
 
a
 
three-day
 
exercise:

as
 
an
 
effective
 
and
 
important
 
point
 
of
 
contact
 
between
 
the
 
farmers
 
and
 
them.
 
If
 
PUMs
 
are
 
educated,
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
pass
 
the
 
knowledge
 
to

Reporting
 
○
 
After
 
the
 
assessment,
 
a
 
report
 
is
 
compiled
 
and
 
submitted
 
to
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
Team
 
and
 
the
 
global

○
 
3PVs
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
submit
 
their
 
reports
 
to
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
Team
 
as
 
well.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
staff
 
and
 
3PVs
 
conduct
 
assessments
 
separately,
 
with
 
a
 
60:40
 
ratio—60%
 
of
 
assessments
 
are
 
done
 
by
 
3PVs,
 
and
 
40%
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
staff.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
staff
 
do
 
not
 
accompany
 
the
 
veriﬁers
 
at
 
all
 
times,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
independence
 
of
 
the
 
third-party
 
veriﬁcation
 
process.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supports
 
veriﬁers
 
with
 
date
 
coordination,
 
Point
 
of
 
Contact
 
(PoC)
 
arrangements,
 
and
 
also
 
provides
 
training
 
(annually
 
7
 
trainings)
 
-
 
both
 
online
 
and
 
ofﬂine
 
-
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
assessments.
 
 
There
 
are
 
64
 
indicators
 
which
 
the
 
PU
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
compliant
 
with,
 
and
 
non-compliance
 
with
 
even
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
indicators
 
results
 
in
 
the
 
loss
 
of
 
the
 
license.
  
It
 
was
 
understood
 
that
 
the
 
license
 
of
 
INTL23
 
is
 
pending
 
while
 
INTL01
 
and
 
INTL02
 
have
 
received
 
their
 
licenses
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
two
 
years.
 
Sampling
 
Methodology
 
and
 
Challenges
17
 
Sampling
 
is
 
primarily
 
used
 
during
 
Surveillance
 
Assessments
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
a
 
representative
 
portion
 
of
 
Producer
 
Units
 
(PUs)
 
is
 
evaluated
 
each
 
year.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
conﬁrm
 
ongoing
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Principles
 
and
 
Criteria
 
(P&amp;C)
 
and
 
to
 
verify
 
that
 
any
 
previous
 
non-conformities
 
have
 
been
 
resolved.
 
Factors
 
considered
 
for
 
calculating
 
the
 
Sample
 
are:
 
●
 
New
 
Farmers:
 
PUs
 
with
 
over
 
33%
 
new
 
farmers
 
automatically
 
receive
 
a
 
mandatory
 
surveillance
 
assessment.
 
●
 
Non-Conformities:
 
PUs
 
that
 
had
 
a
 
high
 
rate
 
of
 
non-conformities
 
in
 
previous
 
assessments
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
selected
 
for
 
surveillance.
 
●
 
Regional
 
Balance:
 
The
 
sample
 
aims
 
to
 
achieve
 
a
 
balanced
 
distribution
 
across
 
different
 
Programme
 
Partners,
 
Local
 
Partners,
 
and
 
regions.
 
●
 
Risk
 
Factors:
 
Information
 
on
 
speciﬁc
 
risk
 
factors,
 
such
 
as
 
known
 
sustainability
 
issues
 
or
 
labor
 
violations
 
in
 
a
 
region,
 
inﬂuences
 
the
 
sampling
 
process.
 
●
 
Size
 
of
 
the
 
Sample:
 
The
 
total
 
sample
 
size
 
for
 
surveillance
 
assessments
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
cover
 
around
 
5%
 
of
 
licensed
 
Producers
 
globally
 
each
 
year,
 
although
 
this
 
may
 
vary
 
based
 
on
 
identiﬁed
 
risks.
 
Given
 
the
 
limited
 
three-day
 
timeframe
 
for
 
assessments,
 
interviewing
 
of
 
15
 
farmers
 
is
 
considered
 
a
 
fair
 
sample
 
size.
 
To
 
ensure
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
their
 
ﬁndings,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
also
 
conduct
 
Focus
 
Group
 
Discussions
 
(FGDs)
 
and
 
engage
 
with
 
local
 
resources,
 
such
 
as
 
pesticide
 
shop
 
owners
 
and
 
village
 
leaders
 
(sarpanch),
 
to
 
cross-check
 
information.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
assessors
 
claim
 
that
 
combination
 
of
 
15
 
farmers,
 
FGDs,
 
and
 
input
 
from
 
local
 
resources
 
provides
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
and

representative
 
sample.
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
3PVs,
  
Better
 
Cotton
 
provides
 
them
 
with
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
farmers,
 
out
 
of
 
which
 
they
 
select
 
15
 
farmers
 
using
 
purposive
 
sampling
 
based
 
on
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
gender
 
representation
 
and
 
geography,
 
irrigation
 
levels,
 
etc
 
to
 
be
 
surveyed
 
for
 
assurance
 
purposes.
  
 
The
 
assurance
 
team
 
is
 
experienced
 
in
 
communicating
 
with
 
farmers
 
and
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
local
 
geography,
 
which
 
facilitates
 
the
 
assessment
 
process.
 
The
 
selection
 
of
 
LGs
 
is
 
done
 
independently
 
by
 
the
 
assessors,
 
considering
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
rain-fed
 
farming
 
practices,
 
landholdings,
 
gender,
 
geographical
 
distribution,
 
and
 
the
 
response
 
of
 
FFs
  
during
 
the
 
opening
 
meeting.
 
This
 
approach
 
helps
 
prevent
 
selection
 
bias,
 
while
 
their
 
objective
 
interviewing
 
techniques
 
mitigate
 
respondent
 
bias.
 
The
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
assessment,
 
including
 
its
 
duration
 
and
 
sample
 
size,
 
does
 
impose
 
some
 
limitations
 
on
 
the
 
assessors'
 
ability
 
to
 
cover
 
all
 
aspects
 
thoroughly.
 
However,
 
if
 
they
 
ﬁnd
 
that
 
three
 
LGs
 
are
 
insufﬁcient
 
or
 
if
 
results
 
are
 
inconclusive,
 
they
 
have
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
to
 
expand
 
the
 
sample
 
to
 
include
 
four
 
or
 
ﬁve
 
LGs.
 
The
 
3PVs
 
encounter
 
challenges
 
when
 
local
 
partners
 
fail
 
to
 
effectively
 
execute
 
their
 
responsibilities
 
and
 
provide
 
adequate
 
support,
 
resulting
 
in
 
delays
 
and
 
time
 
constraints
.
 
This
 
issue
 
is
 
particularly
 
pronounced
 
when
 
the
 
sample
 
includes
 
distant
 
locations,
 
such
 
as
 
villages
 
more
 
than
 
100
 
km
 
apart,
 
making
 
it
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
thoroughly
 
cross-check
 
farmers'
 
lists
 
and
 
other
 
data.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
3PVs
 
also
 
ﬁnd
 
three
 
days
 
insufﬁcient
 
to
 
conduct
 
in-depth
 
interviews.
 
The
 
3PV
 
further
 
added
 
that
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
helpful
 
if
 
data
 
pertaining
 
to
 
PUs
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
one
 
they
 
are
 
visiting
 
is
 
also
 
shared
 
with
 
them
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
holistic
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
they
 
are
 
visiting.
 
Currently,
 
the
 
narrow
 
scope
 
of
 
data
 
(shared
 
for
 
only
 
the
 
PU
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
visiting)
 
makes
 
cross-checking
 
difﬁcult
 
is
 
what
 
he
 
said.
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
there
 
have
 
been
 
instances
 
where
 
disqualiﬁed
 
PUs
 
or
 
LGs
 
simply
 
rebranded
 
themselves
 
while
 
retaining
 
the
 
same
 
farmers,
 
complicating
 
the
 
veriﬁcation
 
process
 
more.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
means
 
of
 
veriﬁcation
 
used,
 
the
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
Lalit
 
stated
 
that
 
the
 
FGDs
 
and
 
information
 
from
 
local
 
resources
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
validate
 
and
 
triangulate
 
their
 
ﬁndings.
 
Expectations
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
from
 
assessors
 
and
 
support
 
provided
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
expects
 
assessors
 
to
 
clearly
 
communicate
 
all
 
requirements
 
to
 
partners,
 
ensuring
 
they
 
fully
 
understand
 
what
 
is
 
expected
 
of
 
them.
 
Activities
 
should
 
be
 
planned
 
proactively,
 
providing
 
partners
 
with
 
sufﬁcient
 
notice
 
to
 
prepare
 
and
 
submit
 
the
 
necessary
 
information
 
on
 
time.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
places
 
a
 
strong
 
emphasis
 
on
 
maintaining
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
data,
 
with
 
thorough
 
investigations
 
conducted
 
to
 
ensure
 
its
 
accuracy
 
and
 
reliability.
 
To
 
ensure
 
smoothness
 
in
 
the
 
assurance
 
processes,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
team
 
has
 
a
 
dedicated
 
Relationship
 
Management
 
team.
 
While
 
the
 
team
 
has
 
many
 
more
 
responsibilities,
 
the
 
one
 
relevant
 
to
 
this
 
project
 
include
 
maintaining
  
close
 
communication
 
with
 
WWF
 
(Telangana),
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
partners
 
receive
 
the
 
standard
 
protocols
 
necessary
 
for
 
compliance.
 
While
 
partners
 
are
 
given
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
to
 
design
 
their
 
own
 
meetings
 
and
 
training
 
calendars,
 
they
 
must
 
adhere
 
to
 
the
 
established
 
principles.
 
 
Risks
 
Considered
 
During
 
Assessments
 
To
 
mitigate
 
risks,
 
the
 
assurance
 
team
 
requests
 
partners
 
to
 
provide
 
them
 
with
 
suitable
 
dates
 
for
 
assessments,
 
as
 
they
 
previously
 
encountered
 
scheduling
 
conﬂicts
 
with
 
local
 
festivals.
 
Recently,
 
one
 
PU
 
informed
 
them
 
of
 
stafﬁng
 
issues,
 
where
 
all
 
had
 
been
 
terminated,
 
leading
 
them
 
to
 
request
 
an
 
extension.
 
In
 
such
 
cases,
 
they
 
evaluate
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
key
 
staff
 
members.
 
If
 
a
 
particular
 
staff
 
member
 
is
 
not
 
crucial
 
to
 
the
 
assessment,
 
they
 
proceed
 
as
 
planned.
 
Additionally,
 
weather
 
conditions
 
46
 


 
can
 
affect
 
the
 
process,
 
as
 
farmers
 
are
 
often
 
less
 
willing
 
to
 
engage
 
during
 
unfavorable
 
weather.
 
These
 
factors
 
are
 
carefully
 
considered
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
assessments.
 
Before
 
the
 
assessment,
 
3PVs
 
do
 
a
 
risk
 
proﬁling,
 
wherein
 
they
 
conduct
 
interviews
 
with
 
three
 
independent
 
stakeholders
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
directly
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
PU
 
(e.g.,
 
KVK,
 
Sarpanch,
 
school
 
teachers)
 
without
 
informing
 
the
 
PU.
 
These
 
interviews
 
provide
 
valuable
 
insights
 
into
 
potential
 
risks
 
and
 
issues,
 
such
 
as
 
child
 
labor,
 
farmer
 
suicides,
 
and
 
other
 
sector-speciﬁc
 
challenges,
 
which
 
helps
 
them
 
be
 
better
 
prepared
 
for
 
the
 
assessment
.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
3PVs
 
conduct
 
daily
 
cross-checks
 
and
 
data
 
triangulation
 
using
 
secondary
 
sources
 
and
 
historical
 
data
 
throughout
 
the
 
assessment
 
process.
 
This
 
approach
 
allows
 
them
 
to
 
address
 
and
 
clarify
 
any
 
discrepancies
 
in
 
real-time
 
during
 
the
 
assessment.
 
Factors
 
Contributing
 
to
 
Non-Compliance
 
Among
 
Farmers
 
The
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
mentioned
 
non-compliance
 
was
 
observed
 
amongst
 
few
 
farmers
 
of
 
the
 
PUs.
 
He
 
stated
 
that
 
several
 
factors
 
contribute
 
to
 
non-compliance
 
among
 
farmers.
 
One
 
signiﬁcant
 
issue
 
is
 
the
 
adoption
 
of
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
which
 
they
 
encourage
 
for
 
safety,
 
but
 
farmers
 
often
 
avoid
 
using
 
them
 
because
 
they
 
feel
 
uncomfortable
 
using
 
them
 
in
 
unfavorable
 
weather
 
conditions.
 
Additionally,
 
extension
 
agents
 
or
 
pesticide
 
vendors
 
sometimes
 
advise
 
farmers
 
to
 
mix
 
chemicals,
 
leading
 
to
 
practices
 
that
 
go
 
against
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
guidelines.
 
Another
 
challenge
 
is
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
certain
 
chemicals
 
banned
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
like
 
monocrotophos,
 
which
 
farmers
 
continue
 
to
 
use
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
inexpensive
 
and
 
readily
 
available.
 
To
 
combat
 
these
 
issues,
 
the
 
assurance
 
team
 
have
 
launched
 
campaigns
18
 
aimed
 
at
 
discouraging
 
such
 
non-compliant
 
behaviors
 
and
 
promoting
 
safer,
 
compliant
 
practices.
 
 
Level
 
of
 
Conﬁdence
 
in
 
Assurance
 
Results
 
 
While
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
assurance
 
process
 
beyond
 
the
 
risks
 
previously
 
mentioned,
 
the
 
remote
 
locations
 
of
 
some
 
LGs
 
can
 
make
 
travel
 
between
 
farmer
 
households
 
time-consuming
 
and
 
logistically
 
challenging,
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
3PVs
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
team.
 
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
how
 
the
 
existing
 
assurance
 
systems
 
and
 
processes
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
mitigate
 
the
 
risks
 
associated
 
with
 
free
 
riders
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
Lalit
 
mentioned
 
that
 
given
 
the
 
resource
 
constraints,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
feasible
 
to
 
have
 
comprehensive
 
details
 
on
 
all
 
farmers.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
free
 
riders
 
cannot
 
be
 
entirely
 
eliminated,
 
even
 
within
 
the
 
PURE
 
framework.
 
Although
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
PURE
 
is
 
not
 
to
 
completely
 
eliminate
 
free
 
riders
 
but
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
risk—keeping
 
it
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
level
 
or
 
reducing
 
it
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
approach—the
 
process
 
requires
 
ongoing
 
monitoring
 
and
 
adaptive
 
strategies
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
framework
 
remains
 
effective
 
in
 
curbing
 
free
 
rider
 
behavior
 
without
 
compromising
 
the
 
overall
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Despite
 
these
 
limitations,
 
he
 
stated
 
that
 
their
 
assurance
 
mechanisms
 
strive
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
such
 
risks
 
by
 
implementing
 
rigorous
 
checks
 
and
 
balances,
 
though
 
the
 
challenge
 
of
 
fully
 
eliminating
 
non-compliance
 
persists.
 
 
To
 
summarize,
 
the
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
has
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
processes
 
related
 
to
 
assurance
,
 
as
 
seen
 
from
 
the
 
table
 
below.
 
The
 
‘level
 
of

is
 
on
 
a

In

it

While
 
speaking
 
to
 
the
 
PUMs,
 
it
 
was
 
understood
 
that
 
under
 
MEL
 
processes,
 
cross-checking
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
component
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
responsible
 
for.
 
For
 
each
 
document,
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
is
 
reviewed
 
to
 
ensure
 
accuracy.
 
Typically,
 
10%
 
to
 
20%
 
of
 
data
 
from
 
each
 
FF
 
is
 
considered.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
an
 
FF
 
oversees
 
four
 
villages,
 
10%
 
of
 
data
 
from
 
each
 
village
 
is
 
sampled
 
and
 
cross-checked
 
by
 
the
 
PUM.
 
The
 
percentage
 
of
 
cross-checked
 
data
 
varies:
 
10%-20%
 
for
 
larger
 
populations
 
and
 
5%-10%
 
for
 
smaller
 
ones,
 
a
 
standard
 
set
 
decided
 
internally
 
by
 
WWF.
 
Typically,
 
the
 
APUM
 
checks
 
40%
 
to
 
50%
 
of
 
data,
 
the
 
PUM
 
checks

are
 
further
 
cross-checked
 
by
 
the

to
 
ensure
 
accuracy.
 
The
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
MEL
 
activities,
 
for
 
PUMs,
 
varies
 
with
 
the
 
season.
 
Currently,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
PUM
 
is
 
focusing
 
on
 
preparing

the

PUM
 
of

mentioned
 
that
 
meeting
 
strict

is
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenge,
 
especially
 
when
 
farmers
 
delay
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
necessary

This
 
delay
 
also
 
makes
 
it
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
FFs
 
to
 
collect
 
data
 
on
 
time.
 
However,
 
these
 
challenges
 
do
 
not
 
impact

the

However,
 
she
 
later
 
added
 
that
 
since

are

work,
 
the
 
percentage
 
of

the

production)
 
and
 
the
 
Result
 
Indicators
 
Report
 
(RIR)
 
data
,
 
which
 
involves
 
collecting
 
data
 
from
 
sampled
 
farmers
 
to
 
assess
 
factors
 
like
 
water
 
and
 
pesticide
 
usage
 
(organic
 
versus
 
chemical
 
etc).
  
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
receives
 
the
 
RIR
 
data
 
12
 
weeks
 
after
 
harvest,
 
after

she
 
conducts
 
a

Data
 
is
 
recorded
 
in
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
format,
 
moving
 
from
 
FFB
 
to
 
the
 
RIR,
 
with
 
potential
 
issues
 
ﬂagged
 
during
 
gap
 
analysis.
 
Following
 
the
 
gap
 
analysis,
 
an
 
outlier
 
check
 
is
 
done
 
to
 
identify
 
data
 
points
 
that
 
are
 
signiﬁcantly
 
different
 
from
 
the
 
average
 
values,
 
for
 
instance,
 
the
 
average
 
cotton
 
yield
 
of
 
each
 
PU
 
is
 
compared
 
to
 
individual
 
farm
 
yields.
 
Signiﬁcant
 
discrepancies,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
PU
 
cotton
 
yield
 
of
 
135
 
kg/ha
 
versus
 
a
 
farm
 
yield
 
of
 
1000
 
kg/ha,
 
prompt
 
further
 
investigation,
 
which
 
may
 
reveal
 
either
 
data
 
errors
 
or
 
genuine
 
issues.
 
This
 
process
 
involves
 
extensive
 
coordination
 
between
 
country
 
MEL,
 
global
 
MEL,
 
and
 
the
 
partners.
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
handles
 
-
 
Cotton
 
Cloud,
 
a

BI
 
dashboard
 
that
 
is

in-house
 
to
 
keep
 
a

of
 
the
 
how
 
much
 
chemicals/pesticides
 
PUs
 
have
 
used,
 
income
 
variation
 
across
 
seasons,
 
etc.
 
The
 
data
 
ﬂow
 
from
 
farmers
 
to
 
the
 
RIR
 
involves
 
changing
 
hands
 
multiple
 
times:
 
FFBs
 
managed
 
by
 
FFs,
 
oversight
 
by
 
PUMs
 
and
 
MEL
 
personnel
 
at
 
the

level,
 
and
 
ﬁnal
 
aggregation
 
by
 
partners
 
in
 
internal
 
Excel
 
sheets
 
before
 
being
 
entered
 
into
 
the
 
Better

mandated
 
RIR
 
excel
 
sheet.
 
PUMs
 
typically
 
complete
 
the

with
 
assistance
 
from

Contextual
 
Information:
 
Introduced
 
three
 
years
 
ago,
 
it
 
includes
 
questions
 
at
 
the
 
PU
 
level,
 
such
 
as
 
whether
 
water
 
levels
 
or
 
costs
 
were
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
previous
 
year.
 
This
 
contextual
 
data
 
helps
 
explain
 
anomalies
 
or
 
outliers
 
in
 
the
 
other
 
reports.
 
These
 
reports
 
are
 
essential
 
for
 
tracking
 
the
 
progress
 
and
 
compliance
 
of
 
PUs
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
Timeliness
 
of
 
Data
 
Reporting
 
Generally,
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
signiﬁcant
 
delays
 
from
 
the
 
partner
 
WWF,
 
as
 
the
 
reporting
 
deadline
 
is
 
three
 
months
 
after
 
the
 
harvest.
 
WWF
 
typically
 
reports
 
diligently
 
and
 
on
 
time.
 
However,
 
when
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
requests
 
clariﬁcations,
 
it
 
often
 
takes
 
time
 
for
 
partners
 
to
 
respond.
 
Despite
 
this,
 
the
 
actual
 
sharing
 
of
 
the
 
RIR
 
(Result
 
Indicators
 
Report)
 
typically
 
meets
 
deadlines.
 
Rectifying
 
Data
 
Collection
 
and
 
Entry
 
Errors
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
also
 
mentioned
 
a
 
common
 
issue
 
that
 
many
 
farmers
 
within
 
a
 
PU
 
face
 
-
 
they
 
report
 
the
 
same
 
yield,
 
which
 
raises
 
concerns
 
about
 
accuracy.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
due
 
to
 
guesstimating,
 
but
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
genuine,
 
as
 
nearby
 
farmers
 
experience
 
the
 
same
 
climatic
 
conditions
 
and
 
pest
 
attacks.
 
There’s
 
also
 
the
 
challenge
 
of
 
units
 
of
 
land
 
size
 
conversion.
 
Farmers
 
often
 
know
 
their
 
land
 
size
 
in
 
bigha,
 
but
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
requires
 
data
 
in
 
hectares
 
(ha),
 
leading
 
to
 
potential
 
inaccuracies
 
during
 
conversion.
 
Similarly,
 
fertilizers
 
are
 
sometimes
 
reported
 
in
 
milliliters
 
(ML)
 
rather
 
than
 
kilograms,
 
causing
 
further
 
complications.
 
Another
 
issue
 
that
 
is
 
reported
 
is
 
that
 
small
 
farmers
 
not
 
having
 
weighing
 
machines,
 
do
 
not
 
always
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
cotton
 
they
 
have
 
produced
 
and
 
sold.
 
It
 
is
 
then
 
recommended
 
that
 
FFs
 
check
 
sale
 
receipts
 
to
 
ensure
 
accurate
 
reporting.
 
Sampling
 
Methodology
 
&amp;
 
its
 
representativeness
 
 
Prior
 
to
 
COVID-19,
 
the
 
sampling
 
methodology
 
for
 
selecting
 
farmers
 
included
 
two
 
types:
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
and
 
Lead
 
farmers,
 
with
 
every
 
LG
 
having
 
one
 
Lead
 
farmer.
 
The
 
sampling
 
approach
 
involved
 
using
 
a
 
95%
 
conﬁdence
 
interval
 
and
 
a
 
5%
 
margin
 
of
 
error.
 
For
 
a
 
PU
 
with
 
around
 
3,500
 
farmers,
 
this
 
meant
 
selecting
 
500
 
to
 
600
 
farmers,
 
including
 
all
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
(100
 
to
 
125)
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers.
 
The
 
methodology
 
involved
 
randomly
 
selecting
 
10
 
LGs
 
out
 
of
 
100
 
for
 
any
 
given
 
PU,
 
and
 
then
 
choosing
 
all
 
farmers
 
within
 
those
 
selected
 
LGs,
 
amounting
 
to
 
about
 
350
 
farmers.
 
The
 
remaining
 
90
 
LGs
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
select
 
Lead
 
farmers.
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
informed
 
that
 
this
 
sampling
 
approach,
 
while
 
focused
 
on
 
ensuring
 
a
 
representative
 
analysis
 
of
 
LGs,
 
had
 
its
 
ﬂaws.
 
The
 
unit
 
of
 
analysis
 
was
 
the
 
PU,
 
and
 
while
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
were
 
randomly
 
selected,
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
were
 
not.
 
This
 
created
 
a
 
methodological
 
ﬂaw,
 
as
 
comparisons
 
between
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
between
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
within
 
the
 
same
 
PU
 
were
 
made
.
 
Despite
 
these
 
issues,
 
only
 
comparisons
 
between
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
were
 
reported
 
externally,
 
as
 
the
 
sampling
 
of
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
was
 
not
 
random.
 
Post
 
COVID-19,
 
the
 
sampling
 
methodology
 
was
 
adjusted.
 
From
 
2020
 
to
 
2023,
 
the
 
sampling
 
methodology
 
mandated
 
that
 
the
 
conﬁdence
 
interval
 
remain
 
at
 
95%,
 
but
 
the
 
margin
 
of
 
error
 
be
 
increased
 
to
 
10%,
 
reducing
 
the
 
effective
 
sample
 
size
 
to
 
200
 
farmers
 
per
 
PU
 
-
 
100
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
and
 
100
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
.
 
The
 
new
 
methodology
 
involved
 
randomly
 
selecting
 
10
 
LGs,
 
from
 
which
 
9
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
were
 
randomly
 
chosen,
 
plus
 
1
 
Lead
 
farmer
 
from
 
the
 
remaining
 
LGs,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
200
 
farmers.
 
 
52
 


 
While
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
PUs
 
continued
 
with
 
this
 
same
 
approach,
 
for
 
the
 
remaining
 
50%
 
another
 
pilot
 
was
 
launched
 
in
 
2023-24,
 
which
 
aimed
 
at
 
reducing
 
the
 
workload
 
burden
 
from
 
FFs
 
which
 
meant
 
reducing
 
the
 
FFB
 
distribution
 
and
 
monitoring
 
support
 
to
 
only
 
5
 
farmers
 
each
 
LG
 
based
 
on
 
feedback
 
that
 
too
 
much
 
time
 
was
 
spent
 
on
 
this
 
task.
 
The
 
adjustments
 
made
 
post
 
COVID-19
 
have
 
increased
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
methodology,
 
making
 
it
 
more
 
representative.
 
However,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
suggestion
 
that
 
the
 
selection
 
of
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
should
 
have
 
been
 
scrapped
 
altogether
 
to
 
further
 
improve
 
the
 
MEL
 
process.
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
were
 
not
 
randomly
 
selected,
 
unlike
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
which
 
introduces
 
bias
 
in
 
the
 
comparisons
 
between
 
Lead
 
farmers,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers.
 
This
 
non-random
 
selection
 
undermines
 
the
 
representativeness
 
and
 
reliability
 
of
 
the
 
sampling
 
process.
 
 
Overall,
 
she
 
could
 
only
 
rate
 
her
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
MEL
 
approach
 
for
 
the
 
RIR
 
data,
 
as
 
that
 
is
 
her
 
primary
 
area
 
of
 
responsibility.
 
The

Strengthening
 
the

Chain
 
and
 
Marketing
 
Dynamics
 
The
 
marketing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
traditionally
 
relied
 
on
 
a
 
strong
 
and
 
grounded
 
supply
 
chain
 
connection
 
directly
 
between
 
farmers
 
and
 
the
 
ginners,
 
most
 
of
 
whom
 
are
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
registered.
 
Although
 
some
 
disruptions
 
have
 
been
 
noted,
 
particularly
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
that
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
have
 
in
 
choosing
 
where
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
(depending
 
on
 
price
 
or
 
already
 
established
 
connections
 
with
 
local
 
traders),
 
the
 
overall
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
eligible
 
for
 
licensing
 
have
 
continued
 
to
 
rise.

Over
 
the
 
years,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
witnessed
 
a
 
steady
 
and
 
positive
 
uptake
 
across
 
various
 
regions,
 
reﬂecting
 
stability
 
and
 
growth
 
in
 
cotton
 
production.
 
This
 
progress
 
has
 
been
 
bolstered
 
by
 
the
 
expansion
 
of
 
cotton
 
ginning
 
industries,
 
particularly
 
in
 
areas
 
like
 
Jammikunta.
 
According
 
to
 
Mukka
 
Narayana,
 
a
 
seasoned
 
ginner
 
from
 
Jammikunta,
 
who
 
has
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
cotton
 
sector
 
since
 
1997,
 
the
 
launch
 
of
 
the
 
Technology
 
Mission
 
on
 
Cotton
 
in
 
2000
 
and
 
its
 
subsequent
 
popularization
 
in
 
2008,
 
mechanized
 
operations
 
have
 
become
 
more
 
prevalent,
 
signiﬁcantly
 
enhancing
 
processing
 
capacity
 
and
 
stabilizing
 
cotton
 
prices
 
over
 
time.
 
These
 
advancements
 
have
 
collectively
 
contributed
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
resilient
 
and
 
efﬁcient
 
cotton
 
supply
 
chain.
 
Financial
 
and
 
Operational
 
Constraints
 
on
 
Ginners
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
coordinator
 
Robin,
 
ginners
 
face
 
signiﬁcant
 
ﬁnancial
 
and
 
operational
 
constraints
 
that
 
impede
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
fully
 
comply
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
requirements
 
to
 
segregate
 
and
 
process
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
The
 
cost-intensive
 
nature
 
of
 
maintaining
 
separate
 
facilities
 
and
 
processes
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
combined
 
with
 
ﬂuctuating
 
cotton
 
prices,
 
presents
 
a
 
considerable
 
challenge
.
 
Ginners
 
have
 
highlighted
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
ﬁnancial
 
support
 
or
 
subsidies
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
or
 
other
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
help
 
mitigate
 
these
 
costs
.
 
Without
 
such
 
support,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
risk
 
that
 
ginners
 
may
 
deprioritize
 
the
 
separation
 
and
 
processing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
potentially
 
compromising
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
This
 
risk
 
is
 
however
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
mitigated
 
after
 
the
 
PU
 
Rescoping
 
which
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
ginners
 
to
 
bulk
 
the
 
cotton
 
from
 
a
 
geography
 
as
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
Marketing
 
and
 
Distribution
 
Complexities
 
Farmers
 
typically
 
market
 
their
 
cotton
 
through
 
two
 
primary
 
channels:
 
the
 
Government
 
Market
 
Yard,
 
which
 
operates
 
from
 
6
 
AM
 
to
 
9
 
AM,
 
or
 
by
 
directly
 
transporting
 
their
 
produce
 
to
 
preferred
 
ginning
 
mills.
 
In
 
both
 
scenarios,
 
the
 
transportation
 
cost
 
is
 
borne
 
by
 
the
 
farmer,
 
a
 
factor
 
that
 
sometimes
 
prompts
 
them
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
to
 
private
 
parties.
 
However,
 
transactions
 
with
 
private
 
parties
 
are
 
fraught
 
with
 
risks,
 
as
 
payments
 
are
 
often
 
made
 
on
 
credit,
 
with
 
only
 
partial
 
payments
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
sale.
 
This
 
arrangement
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
fraudulent
 
activities,
 
putting
 
the
 
farmers
 
at
 
a
 
disadvantage.
 
Despite
 
the
 
regulated
 
environment
 
of
 
the
 
government
 
marketplace,
 
where
 
transactions
 
involve
 
approved
 
agents,
 
and
 
the
 
direct
 
transport
 
to
 
ginners,
 
where
 
negotiations
 
occur
 
directly
 
in
 
between
 
the
 
farmer
 
and
 
the
 
ginner,
 
challenges
 
persist.
 
The
 
decentralized
 
and
 
dispersed
 
distribution
 
network
 
complicates
 
the
 
accumulation
 
of
 
sufﬁcient
 
quantities
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
within
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
timeframe.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
ginners
 
often
 
mix
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
which
 
undermines
 
the
 
traceability
 
and
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.

of
 
Local
 
Market
 
Dynamics
 
Local
 
market
 
dynamics,
 
including
 
competition
 
from
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
buyers
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
government
 
policies
 
on
 
cotton
 
pricing,
 
play
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
shaping
 
the
 
decisions
 
of
 
both
 
farmers
 
and
 
ginners.
 
In
 
many
 
cases,
 
these
 
dynamics
 
lead
 
ginners
 
to
 
prioritize
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
due
 
to
 
better
 
immediate
 
returns.
 
This
 
prioritization
 
can
 
undermine
 
the

1.
 
Impact
 
of
 
Irregular
 
Monsoons
 
on
 
Cotton
 
Production:
 
While
 
the
 
recent
 
monsoon
 
season
 
brought
 
challenges,
 
particularly
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
rainfall
 
scarcity,
 
the
 
program's
 
emphasis
 
on
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
has
 
helped
 
mitigate
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
impacts.
 
Farmers
 
have
 
been
 
equipped
 
with
 
techniques
 
to
 
better
 
manage
 
water
 
resources,
 
and
 
have
 
been
 
trained
 
on
 
border
 
croppings
 
and
 
inter
 
croppings,
 
leading
 
to
 
more
 
stable
 
yields
 
despite
 
adverse
 
weather
 
conditions.
 
However,
 
there
 
have
 
been
 
multiple
 
suggestions
 
from
 
farmers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
Field
 
Facilitators
 
for
 
an
 
improved
 
intervention
 
on
 
irrigation
 
facilities
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
providing
 
the
 
necessary
 
equipment
 
and
 
tools,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
guidance
 
for
 
water
 
management.
 
2.
 
Shift
 
Towards
 
Mechanized
 
Farming:
 
The
 
labor-intensive
 
nature
 
of
 
cotton
 
farming
 
has
 
driven
 
some
 
farmers
 
to
 
explore
 
alternatives,
 
such
 
as
 
paddy
 
cultivation.
 
With
 
paddy
 
cultivation
 
becoming
 
extremely
 
machine
 
driven,
 
the
 
farmers
 
get
 
ample
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
for
 
other
 
activities
 
as
 
well.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
cotton
 
being
 
primarily
 
labor
 
driven
 
increases
 
the
 
cost
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
effort.
 
3.
 
Disease
 
and
 
Pest
 
Infestations:
 
Pest-related
 
challenges,
 
such
 
as
 
locust
 
infestations,
 
have
 
been
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
concern.
 
However,
 
the
 
program’s
 
focus
 
on
 
integrated
 
pest
 
management
 
and
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
resistant
 
cotton
 
varieties
 
have
 
played
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
reducing
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
these
 
threats,
 
thereby
 
supporting
 
the
 
overall
 
increase
 
in
 
licensed
 
cotton
 
volumes.
 
The
 
3rd
 
party
 
veriﬁers
 
spoke
 
of
 
the
 
expected
 
improvement
 
in
 
this
 
aspect
 
with
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
Rescoping,
 
allowing
 
the
 
interventions
 
to
 
be
 
conducted
 
on
 
a
 
geographical
 
area
 
rather
 
than
 
on
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
alone.
 
 
 
Challenges
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Certiﬁcation
 
and
 
Compliance
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
established
 
connections
 
with
 
approximately
 
250-270
 
ginners
 
across
 
the
 
country,
 
who
 
are
 
certiﬁed
 
annually
 
after
 
participating
 
in
 
a
 
mandatory
 
one-day
 
training
 
session.
 
These
 
ginners
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
separate
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
from
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
during
 
processing.
 
However,
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
policy
 
of
 
allowing
 
farmers
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
to
 
choose
 
when
 
and
 
where
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
a
 
dispersed
 
distribution
 
network.
 
This
 
situation
 
creates
 
challenges
 
for
 
ginners,
 
who
 
struggle
 
to
 
accumulate
 
sufﬁcient
 
quantities
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
variant
 
at
 
any
 
given
 
time,
 
often
 
resulting
 
in
 
the
 
unintended
 
mixing
 
of
 
conventional
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
Additionally,
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
cotton
 
ends
 
up
 
with
 
ginners
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
registered
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
leading
 
to
 
gaps
 
in
 
traceability
 
and
 
difﬁculties
 
in
 
accurately
 
reporting
 
the
 
volumes
 
collected.
 
The
 
dispersed
 
nature
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supply
 
further
 
complicates
 
the
 
ginners'
 
ability
 
to
 
process
 
it
 
separately,
 
leading
 
to
 
logistical
 
constraints
 
and
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
motivation
 
among
 
ginners
 
to
 
maintain
 
their
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
licenses.
 
Without
 
any
 
additional
 
incentives
 
or
 
support
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
many
 
ginners
 
express
 
reluctance
 
in
 
continuing
 
with
 
the
 
program,
 
further
 
jeopardizing
 
the
 
integrity
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supply
 
chain.
 
The
 
timing
 
of
 
cotton
 
sales
 
is
 
often
 
dictated
 
by
 
the
 
farmers'
 
immediate
 
ﬁnancial
 
needs
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
scientiﬁc
 
consideration
 
of
 
storage.
 
Farmers
 
usually
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
according
 
to
 
convenience,
 
sometimes
 
storing
 
it
 
for
 
6-8
 
months,
 
which
 
can
 
degrade
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
cotton.
 
This
 
lack
 
of
 
55
 


 
adherence
 
to
 
scientiﬁc
 
storage
 
practices
 
further
 
complicates
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
and
 
reduces
 
the
 
overall
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
reaching
 
the
 
market.
 
Ginners
 
also
 
face
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
system
 
to
 
differentiate
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
from
 
conventional
 
cotton
.
 
Since
 
there
 
is
 
practically
 
no
 
major
 
outward
 
difference
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
varieties,
 
ginners
 
can
 
only
 
crosscheck
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Farmers
 
List
 
as
 
an
 
evidence
 
for
 
the
 
produced
 
cotton
 
to
 
be
 
considered
 
as
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
Practically
 
hence,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmer
 
can
 
only
 
put
 
forth
 
his
 
certiﬁcation
 
as
 
a
 
negotiating
 
tool
 
with
 
the
 
ginner;
 
instances
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
demanding
 
high
 
price
 
have
 
also
 
been
 
reported
 
from
 
the
 
ginners
 
which
 
the
 
ginner
 
is
 
reluctant
 
to
 
pay.
 
 
Added
 
to
 
these,
 
some
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
growers
 
remain
 
resistant
 
to
 
adopting
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
recommended
 
practices.
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
growers
 
do
 
not
 
perceive
 
signiﬁcant
 
value
 
in
 
altering
 
their
 
established
 
methods
 
which
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
practicing
 
for
 
years,
 
speciﬁcally
 
as
 
they
 
already
 
achieve
 
satisfactory
 
quality
 
and
 
yields
 
with
 
their
 
current
 
practices.
 
This
 
resistance
 
to
 
change
 
poses
 
additional
 
challenges
 
in
 
expanding
 
the
 
uptake
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
within
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.

manages
 
audits,
 
reviews
 
reports,
 
and
 
builds
 
capacity,
 
particularly
 
within
 
the
 
ginning
 
segment.
 
This
 
role
 
involves
 
overseeing
 
capacity-building
 
programs
 
for
 
ginners,
 
ensuring
 
compliance
 
with
 
CoC
 
standards
 
throughout
 
the
 
supply
 
chain,
 
from
 
ginners
 
to
 
end
 
manufacturers.
 
These
 
programs
 
are
 
typically
 
held
 
in
 
August
 
and
 
September.
 
Monitoring
 
and
 
audits
 
are
 
central
 
to
 
the
 
role,
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
addressing
 
ginners’
 
queries
 
and
 
providing
 
technical
 
assistance
 
on
 
the
 
Better
 
56
 


 
Cotton
 
platform.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
process
 
includes
 
onboarding
 
ginners
 
located
 
within
 
a
 
50
 
to
 
100
 
km
 
radius
 
of
 
PUs
 
to
 
ensure
 
proximity
 
to
 
farmers.
 
Each
 
ginner
 
is
 
assigned
 
a
 
unique
 
code,
 
and
 
participation
 
is
 
free.
 
However,
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
is
 
challenged
 
by
 
the
 
potential
 
mixing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
during
 
transportation
 
and
 
processing.
 
To
 
mitigate
 
this,
 
regular
 
visits
 
to
 
ginners
 
are
 
conducted
 
during
 
the
 
active
 
season
 
from
 
September
 
to
 
March
 
to
 
enforce
 
segregation
 
standards.
 
 
Traceability
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
the
 
role,
 
requiring
 
ginners
 
to
 
maintain
 
detailed
 
records
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level,
 
including
 
transportation
 
methods,
 
quantities
 
purchased,
 
and
 
the
 
source
 
of
 
the
 
cotton—whether
 
directly
 
from
 
farmers
 
or
 
through
 
middlemen.
 
Supporting
 
documents,
 
such
 
as
 
purchase
 
slips,
 
quantity
 
slips,
 
and
 
transportation
 
records,
 
must
 
be
 
meticulously
 
kept.
 
A
 
key
 
challenge
 
arises
 
when
 
ginners
 
cannot
 
dispatch
 
separate
 
vehicles
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton,
 
heightening
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
mixing.
 
To
 
address
 
this,
 
segregation
 
practices
 
are
 
emphasized
 
during
 
training
 
sessions,
 
and
 
vehicle
 
records
 
are
 
scrutinized
 
during
 
assessments
 
to
 
mitigate
 
this
 
risk.
 
The
 
supply
 
chain
 
is
 
complex,
 
involving
 
multiple
 
stages
 
from
 
ginners
 
to
 
traders,
 
spinners,
 
yarn
 
producers,
 
fabric
 
manufacturers,
 
and
 
ﬁnally,
 
brands.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
platform
 
records
 
the
 
quantity
 
of
 
cotton
 
purchased
 
but
 
does
 
not
 
track
 
pricing,
 
which
 
is
 
negotiated
 
between
 
buyers
 
and
 
sellers.
 
Once
 
cotton
 
is
 
recorded
 
on
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
platform,
 
it
 
enters
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supply
 
chain,
 
though
 
not
 
all
 
Better
 
Cotton-produced
 
cotton
 
may
 
end
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
if
 
sold
 
elsewhere,
 
posing
 
a
 
challenge
 
to
 
system
 
credibility.
 
Gaps
 
between
 
ginners
 
and
 
farmers,
 
especially
 
in
 
regions
 
like
 
Tamil
 
Nadu,
 
where
 
ginners
 
have
 
limited
 
information
 
about
 
farmers,
 
further
 
complicate
 
credibility.
 
The
 
uptake
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
often
 
falls
 
short
 
of
 
the
 
expected
 
AAV
 
for
 
each
 
PU,
 
leading
 
to
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
reported
 
volumes.
 
While
 
ginners
 
maintain
 
physical
 
traceability,
 
limitations
 
arise
 
as
 
cotton
 
moves
 
further
 
along
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
The
 
system
 
employs
 
two
 
models
 
for
 
CoC:
 
physical
 
traceability
 
and
 
mass
 
balance
 
(MB).
 
The
 
physical
 
model
 
requires
 
strict
 
separation
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
at
 
every
 
stage,
 
though
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
mixing
 
remains.
 
The
 
MB
 
model
 
is
 
more
 
ﬂexible,
 
using
 
BCCUs
 
(Better
 
Cotton
 
claim
 
units)
 
to
 
represent
 
the
 
quantity
 
of
 
lint
 
cotton
 
sold.
 
However,
 
audits
 
are
 
conducted
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
these
 
points
 
are
 
only
 
transferred
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
an
 
actual
 
physical
 
transaction,
 
preserving
 
the
 
system’s
 
credibility.
 
Ginners’
 
Perspectives
 
and
 
Future
 
Outlook
 
Ginners
 
have
 
expressed
 
optimism
 
about
 
the
 
potential
 
beneﬁts
 
of
 
a
 
geographic
 
rescoping
 
approach,
 
which
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
facilitate
 
better
 
collectivization
 
and
 
easier
 
categorization
 
of
 
cotton
 
varieties.
 
Such
 
a
 
system
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
by
 
doing
 
away
 
with
 
having
 
to
 
process
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
separately,
 
thus
 
addressing
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
major
 
challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
ginners
 
at
 
present.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
case
 
for
 
adopting
 
a
 
more
 
scientiﬁc
 
approach
 
to
 
post-harvest
 
management.
 
Given
 
that
 
farmers
 
often
 
sell
 
their
 
produce
 
based
 
on
 
convenience
 
rather
 
than
 
scientiﬁc
 
storage
 
timings,
 
promoting
 
better
 
storage
 
practices
 
and
 
speciﬁc
 
duration
 
for
 
sales
 
could
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improve
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
.
 
Ginners
 
suggest
 
that
 
post-harvest
 
marketing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
should
 
be
 
collectivized,
 
with
 
assistance
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
to
 
enhance
 
both
 
the

Limitations
 
Certain
 
limitations
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
are
 
given
 
below
 
-
 
 
a)
 
While
 
care
 
has
 
been
 
taken
 
to
 
clearly
 
outline
 
and
 
quantify
 
wherever
 
possible
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
stakeholders,
 
the
 
contextual
 
and
 
subjective
 
nature
 
of
 
ﬁndings
 
associated
 
with
 
qualitative
 
outcomes
 
could
 
limit
 
the
 
effective
 
comparison
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
ﬁndings
 
with
 
the
 
endline.
 
 
b)
 
Perspectives
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
(though
 
obtained
 
qualitatively)
 
could
 
not
 
be
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
extremely
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
locate
 
women
 
program
 
farmers,
 
given
 
the
 
low
 
reach
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
towards
 
women
 
farmers
 
at
 
present.
 
 
c)
 
Given
 
the
 
context-speciﬁc
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
intervention,
 
it
 
could
 
prove
 
challenging
 
to
 
prove
 
the
 
external
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
necessary
 
for
 
scaling
 
of
 
the

Caste
 
as
 
a

observed
 
to
 
play
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
day
 
to
 
day
 
activities
 
of
 
the
 
learning
 
groups
 
such
 
as
 
meetings
 
and
 
trainings.
 
It
 
was
 
reported
 
during
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
farmers
 
and
 
FFs
 
that
 
separate
 
seating
 
arrangements
 
are
 
made,
 
as
 
per
 
preexisting
 
social
 
hierarchy,
 
for
 
farmers
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
different
 
caste
 
groups
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
village.
 
The
 
powerful
 
castes
 
took
 
the
 
front
 
rows
 
while
 
the
 
marginalized
 
castes,
 
speciﬁcally
 
communities
 
including
 
the
 
dalits,
 
were
 
given
 
seats
 
at
 
the
 
end.
 
The
 
FFs
 
put
 
forth
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
necessary
 
arrangement
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
there’s
 
no
 
inﬁghting
 
within
 
the
 
learning
 
groups.
 
At
 
least
 
in
 
a
 
few
 
villages,
 
the
 
learning
 
groups
 
are
 
at

said

Summary
 
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
Producer
 
Unit
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
has
 
been
 
designed
 
with
 
the
 
3-fold
 
aims
 
of
 
 
(i)
 
Enhancing
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
through
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
focusing
 
on
 
natural
 
resources,
 
pest
 
management,
 
labor
 
practices,
 
gender
 
equality,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods.
 
(ii)
 
Improving
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
administration,
 
implementing
 
alternative
 
monitoring
 
methods,
 
and
 
increasing
 
producer
 
unit
 
scale.
 
(iii)
 
Facilitating
 
improved
 
stronger
 
ﬁrst
 
mile
 
traceability
 
and
 
removing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
physical
 
segregation
 
of
 
cotton
 
from
 
individual
 
farms.
 
The
 
new
 
approach
 
also
 
necessitates
 
relevant
 
changes
 
in
 
the
 
assurance,
 
MEL
 
and
 
traceability
 
approaches
 
undertaken
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
attest
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
and
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supplied
 
with
 
a
 
higher
 
degree
 
of
 
conﬁdence.
 
To
 
pilot
 
this
 
intervention,
 
the
 
three
 
Producer
 
Units
 
(INTL01,
 
INTL02,
 
and
 
INTL23)
 
located
 
in
 
Karimnagar
 
and
 
Warangal
 
districts
 
of
 
Telangana
 
will
 
be
 
reorganized
 
into
 
a
 
single,
 
larger
 
Producer
 
Unit.
 
This
 
new
 
unit
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
cover
 
the
 
area
 
previously
 
managed
 
by
 
the
 
three
 
units
 
but
 
will
 
also
 
incorporate
 
new
 
villages
 
and
 
farming
 
households
 
(FHH)
 
from
 
both
 
existing
 
and
 
newly
 
added
 
villages.
 
Baseline
 
approach
 
The
 
baseline
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
Producer
 
unit
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
seeks
 
to
 
validate
 
the
 
problem
 
statements
 
and
 
establish
 
the
 
values
 
of
 
the
 
seven
 
major
 
key
 
performance
 
indicators
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
at
 
the
 
baseline
 
(prior
 
to
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
intervention)
 
so
 
that
 
measurement
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
KPIs
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
(post
 
the
 
intervention)
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
provide
 
sufﬁcient
 
evidence
 
on
 
the
 
successful
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
approach
 
along
 
with
 
nuanced
 
insights
 
on
 
scaling
 
up
 
of
 
the
 
initiative.
 
In-depth
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
a
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
of
 
120
 
farmers
 
served
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
source
 
of
 
data
 
for
 
this
 
study;
 
with
 
secondary
 
data
 
being
 
referred
 
to
 
gather
 
information
 
on
 
a
 
select
 
few
 
indicators.
 
Efforts
 
involved
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
Interactions
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
revealed
 
that
 
a
 
considerable
 
amount
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
does
 
go
 
into
 
data
 
collection.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
farming
 
season,
 
a
 
fair
 
amount
 
of
 
information
 
on
 
cotton
 
cultivation
 
is
 
gathered
 
using
 
data
 
collection
 
exercises
 
such
 
as
 
early
 
season
 
estimates,
 
farmer
 
ﬁeld
 
books,
 
post
 
harvest
 
estimates,
 
RIR
 
and
 
soil
 
health
 
is
 
collected
 
from
 
the
 
farmers.
 
Overall,
 
FFs
 
report
 
spending
 
nearly
 
30
 
to
 
45%
 
on
 
such
 
data
 
related
 
work,
 
20
 
to
 
30%
 
on
 
administrative
 
work
 
and
 
25%
 
to
 
50%
 
on
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
of
 
farmers.
 
The
 
PUMs
 
also
 
spend
 
a
 
good
 
portion
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
on
 
verifying
 
the
 
data
 
sent
 
by
 
FFs.
 
They
 
reported
 
that
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
manually
 
collecting
 
information,
 
verifying
 
and
 
uploading
 
the
 
same
 
in
 
soft
 
copies
 
is
 
particularly
 
cumbersome.
 
Even
 
while
 
being
 
inherently
 
motivated
 
to
 
put
 
in
 
a
 
higher
 
number
 
of
 
hours
 
doing
 
ﬁeld
 
work,
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff
 
mentioned
 
that
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
farmers
 
is
 
what
 
enables
 
them
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
issues
 
faced
 
by
 
the
 
farmers
 
in
 
adoption
 
of
 
practices
 
in
 
turn
 
contributing
 
towards
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
sustainability
 
objectives.
 
Hence,
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
to
 
reduce
 
efforts
 
involved
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
increase
 
time
 
spent
 
in
 
strengthening
 
the
 
capacity
 
of
 
the
 
farmers
 
was
 
evidenced
 
from
 
the
 
baseline
 
study.
 
 
Women
 
Participation
 
The
 
focus
 
and
 
reach
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
programs
 
towards
 
women
 
farmers
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
lower
 
side
 
at
 
present.
 
In
 
a
 
traditional
 
PU
 
catering
 
to
 
around
 
3000-3500
 
farmers,
 
~98%
 
are
 
men,
 
and
 
~2%
 
to
 
3%
 
are
 
women.
 
Women
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
primarily
 
because
 
of
 
beneﬁts
 
such
 
as
 
enhancement
 
in
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
their
 
crops
 
and
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
ﬁnancially
 
support
 
their
 
4
 


 
households.
 
Interestingly,
 
the
 
uptake
 
of
 
practices
 
(such
 
as
 
intercropping,
 
border
 
cropping,
 
optimizing
 
land
 
use
 
and
 
improving
 
crop
 
diversity)
 
and
 
accrual
 
of
 
beneﬁts
 
was
 
noted
 
to
 
be
 
much
 
higher
 
for
 
women
 
farmers
 
and
 
co-farmers
 
belonging
 
to
 
the
 
INTL01/02
 
PUs
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
relatively
 
newer
 
INTL23.
 
Non-program
 
farmers
 
also
 
expressed
 
their
 
interest
 
in
 
becoming
 
a
 
program
 
farmer
 
and
 
adopting
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
practices,
 
provided
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
are
 
held
 
at
 
a
 
time,
 
frequency
 
and
 
duration
 
of
 
their
 
convenience.
 
All
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
remarks
 
point
 
towards
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
higher
 
extent
 
of
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
efforts
 
to
 
be
 
directed
 
towards
 
women
 
farmers,
 
especially
 
those
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PUs.
 
 
Effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
Inferences
 
from
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
farmers
 
(mostly
 
male)
 
provides
 
credible
 
evidence
 
towards
 
the
 
quality
 
and
 
efﬁcacy
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
while
 
also
 
indicating
 
farmer
 
preferences
 
for
 
more
 
audio-visual
 
training
 
content
 
and
 
farm
 
exposure
 
visits.
 
Similar
 
to
 
data
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
women
 
program
 
farmers,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
also
 
revealed
 
that
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
adoption
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
practices
 
was
 
higher
 
in
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
older
 
PU
 
(INTL01/02)
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
newer
 
one
 
(INTL23).
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
noted
 
that
 
getting
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
topics
 
(94%),
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
teaching
 
approach
 
of
 
the
 
facilitator
 
(72%),
 
handholding
 
support
 
provided
 
in
 
adoption
 
of
 
practices
 
(61%)
 
and
 
going
 
on
 
exposure
 
visits
 
(91%)
 
were
 
the
 
major
 
reasons
 
for
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PU
 
to
 
continue
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Higher
 
yield
 
and
 
improved
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton
 
were
 
the
 
main
 
beneﬁts
 
that
 
about
 
86%
 
and
 
57%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
reported
 
from
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
50%
 
and
 
20%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU.
 
The
 
uptake
 
of
 
practices
 
was
 
lesser
 
in
 
INTL23
 
mainly
 
due
 
an
 
earlier
 
dissatisfying
 
experience
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
with
 
adoption
 
of
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices.
 
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
harvest
 
Analysis
 
of
 
secondary
 
data
 
available
 
on
 
the
 
cotton
 
area,
 
volumes
 
licensed
 
and
 
harvested
 
denotes
 
an
 
overall
 
increasing
 
trend
 
from
 
2021
 
to
 
2023.
 
Volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
cotton
 
harvested
 
have
 
increased,
 
on
 
average,
 
by
 
6.65%,
 
8.15%
 
and
 
14.58%
 
for
 
INTL01,
 
02
 
and
 
23
 
respectively
 
from
 
2021
 
to
 
2023.
 
Assurance
 
approach
 
The
 
assurance
 
approach
 
practiced
 
traditionally
 
was
 
described
 
as
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
process.
 
The
 
licensing
 
assessments
 
take
 
place
 
in
 
3
 
years
 
for
 
each
 
PU
 
and
 
are
 
aimed
 
at
 
verifying
 
if
 
PUs
 
are
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards
 
of
 
cotton
 
production.
 
The
 
third-party
 
veriﬁer
 
mentioned
 
doing
 
a
 
risk
 
proﬁling
 
before
 
the
 
assessment,
 
wherein
 
interviews
 
are
 
conducted
 
with
 
three
 
independent
 
stakeholders
 
not
 
directly
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
PU.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
expressed
 
a
 
good
 
degree
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
assurance
 
system
 
being
 
used
 
at
 
present.
  
 
Monitoring,
 
Evaluation
 
and
 
Learning
 
approach
 
 
The
 
MEL
 
coordinator
 
elaborated
 
on
 
the
 
MEL
 
systems
 
and
 
processes
 
put
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
continuously
 
monitor
 
the
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
data
 
required
 
-
 
mainly
 
reach,
 
farmer
 
lists
 
and
 
RIR.
 
Thorough
 
checking
 
and
 
veriﬁcation
 
of
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
data
 
takes
 
place
 
at
 
every
 
stage
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
reporting.
 
A
 
moderate-to-high
 
degree
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
was
 
expressed
 
by
 
the
 
coordinator
 
in
 
the
 
MEL
 
approach
 
utilized,
 
while
 
also
 
highlighting
 
a
 
small
 
ﬂaw
 
in
 
sampling
 
of
 
lead
 
farmers
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
program
 
farmers.

Supply
 
chain
 
credibility
 
Interactions
 
with
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
coordinator
 
and
 
the
 
ginner
 
brought
 
out
 
pressing
 
issues
 
affecting
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
uptake
 
and
 
supply
 
chain
 
credibility.
 
It
 
was
 
mentioned
 
that
 
given
 
the
 
low
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
being
 
procured
 
by
 
the
 
ginners
 
in
 
the
 
region,
 
it
 
is
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
him
 
to
 
segregate
 
and
 
process
 
it
 
separately
 
as
 
against
 
the

The

chain
 
coordinator
 
also
 
reiterated
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
gets
 
challenged
 
by
 
the
 
potential
 
mixing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
during
 
transportation
 
and
 
processing.
 
To
 
mitigate
 
this,
 
regular
 
visits
 
to
 
ginners
 
are
 
conducted
 
during
 
the
 
active
 
season
 
from
 
September
 
to
 
March
 
to
 
enforce

Findings
 
from
 
the
 
baseline
 
bring
 
forth
 
substantial
 
evidence
 
for
 
the
 
issues
 
-
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
efforts
 
spent
 
in
 
data
 
and
 
administration,
 
low
 
participation
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
in
 
the

-
 
that
 
the
 
PU

●
 
Organize
 
meetings
 
speciﬁcally
 
for

farmers
 
to
 
boost
 
their
 
participation,
 
taking
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
face,
 
such
 
as
 
domestic
 
duties,
 
travel
 
distances,
 
convenient
 
timings
 
(mostly
 
night)
 
and
 
reasonable
 
duration
 
(45
 
minutes).
 
●
 
Expand
 
the
 
scale
 
of
 
demonstrations
 
to
 
include
 
a
 
broader
 
group
 
of
 
farmers
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
more
 
beneﬁcial
 
and
 
inclusive.
 
 
●
 
Incorporate
 
more
 
audiovisual
 
tools
 
into
 
training
 
sessions
 
to
 
improve
 
farmers'
 
comprehension
 
and
 
retention.
 
●
 
Simpliﬁcation
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
and

so
 
that

can
 
easily

thereby
 
bringing
 
in

so
 
that
 
the

could
 
be
 
used
 
for

farmers
 
suggested
 
having
 
more

wise
 
trainings,
 
but
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
convenient
 
to
 
them.
 
●
 
Farmers
 
requested
 
to
 
provide
 
free
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
as
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
₹
1000
 
per
 
kit
 
is
 
burdensome
 
for
 
them.
 
 
●
 
To
 
provide
 
small
 
scale
 
farmers
 
with
 
cotton
 
storage
 
bags,
 
who
 
often
 
struggle
 
to
 
afford
 
these
 
materials.
 
While
 
larger
 
farmers
 
can
 
purchase
 
storage
 
supplies,
 
small
 
farmers
 
would
 
beneﬁt
 
from
 
receiving
 
high-quality
 
storage
 
bags.

rather
 
than

They
 
cited
 
uneasiness
 
and

Introduction
 
1.1.
 
Background
 
of
 
the
 
PURE
 
project
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
stands
 
as
 
the
 
globe's
 
foremost
 
cotton
 
sustainability
 
initiative.
 
Its
 
mission
 
is
 
to
 
help
 
'cotton
 
communities
 
survive
 
and
 
thrive,
 
while
 
protecting
 
and
 
restoring
 
the
 
environment’.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
seeks
 
to
 
transform
 
cotton
 
production
 
worldwide
 
by
 
promoting
 
more
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices,
 
improving
 
livelihoods,
 
and
 
ensuring
 
the
 
long-term
 
health
 
of
 
farming
 
communities
 
and
 
the
 
environment.
 
The
 
innovative
 
pilot
 
project
 
called
 
-
 
the
 
'Producer
 
Unit
 
Rescoping'
 
(PURE)
 
pilot
 
aims
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
a
 
new,
 
geographic
 
approach
 
to
 
implementing
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Standard
 
System
 
to
 
improve
 
efﬁciency,
 
effectiveness
 
and
 
sustainability
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
by
 
supporting
 
more
 
holistic,
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
-
 
especially
 
around
 
the
 
six
 
principles
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
namely,
 
Management,
 
Natural
 
Resources,
 
Crop
 
Protection,
 
Fibre
 
Quality,
 
Decent
 
Work,
 
and
 
Sustainable
 
Livelihoods.
 
Replacing
 
the
 
prevailing
 
method
 
that
 
centers
 
solely
 
on
 
speciﬁed
 
(typically
 
male)
 
farmers
 
on
 
a
 
designated
 
list,
 
PURE
 
broadens
 
its
 
scope
 
to
 
encompass
 
all
 
farming
 
households
 
within
 
a
 
deﬁned
 
geographic
 
unit
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
The
 
project
 
envisages
 
improving
 
the
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
and
 
administration
 
efforts
 
associated
 
with
 
farmer
 
lists
 
or
 
other
 
data
 
related
 
processes,
 
and
 
using
 
alternate
 
methods
 
to
 
monitor
 
implementation
 
(such
 
as
 
periodic
 
baseline
 
studies,
 
GIS
 
and
 
government
 
data,
 
gin
 
procurement
 
volumes,
 
and
 
other
 
secondary
 
sources).
 
The
 
pilot
 
aims
 
to
 
support
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
overall
 
goal
 
towards
 
traceability
 
by
 
facilitating
 
stronger
 
farm-to-gin
 
traceability
 
and
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
segregate
 
cotton
 
from
 
individual
 
farms.
 
 
1.2.
 
Objectives
 
of
 
the
 
Program
 
 
The
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
producer
 
unit
 
rescoping
 
pilot
 
are
 
as
 
follows
 
-
  
 
●
 
Enhance
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
through
 
community-based
 
approaches
 
focusing
 
on
 
natural
 
resources,
 
pest
 
management,
 
labor
 
practices,
 
gender
 
equality,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods.
 
●
 
Improve
 
efﬁciency
 
and
 
scalability
 
by
 
reducing
 
data
 
administration,
 
implementing
 
alternative
 
monitoring
 
methods,
 
and
 
increasing
 
producer
 
unit
 
scale.
 
●
 
Facilitating
 
improved
 
stronger
 
ﬁrst
 
mile
 
traceability
 
and
 
removing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
physical
 
segregation
 
of
 
cotton
 
from
 
individual
 
farms.

the
 
Better

team
 
before
 
being
 
ﬁnalized
 
and
 
deployed
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
survey
 
was
 
digitized
 
on
 
the
 
SurveyCTO
 
platform
 
in
 
English
 
and
 
in
 
Telugu.
 
Qualiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
and

were
 
hired
 
to
 
administer
 
the
 
CAPI
 
tool
 
and
 
facilitate
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
respectively.
     
 
Detailed
 
qualitative
 
guides
 
were
 
developed
 
to
 
facilitate
 
semi-structured
 
conversations
 
with
 
stakeholders
 
on
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
key

and
 
the
 
supporting
 
activities
 
such
 
as
 
monitoring,
 
evaluation,
 
assurance
 
and
 
supply
 
chain.
 
While
 
the
 
quantitative
 
tool
 
helped
 
get
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
awareness
 
and
 
adoption
 
of
 
better
 
cotton
 
practices
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
farmers,
 
the
 
qualitative
 
tools
 
captured
 
the
 
perceptions
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders
 
on
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
KPIs,
 
and
 
the
 
causal
 
relationships
 
underlying
 
their
 
perceptions.
 
Data
 
on
 
the

Data
 
Collection
 
and
 
Management
 
For
 
ﬁeld
 
data
 
collection
 
in
 
Telangana,
 
CMS
 
deployed
 
an
 
experienced
 
set
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
researchers
   
with
 
domain
 
experience
 
within
 
the
 
pool
 
of
 
trained
 
and
 
ethical
 
certiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
from
 
the
 
Community
 
Engagement
 
unit.
 
This
 
team
 
was
 
managed
 
by
 
ﬁeld
 
coordinators
 
and
 
the
 
Field
 
Manager
 
of
 
the
 
South
 
Zone.
 
A
 
total
 
of
 
6
 
enumerators
 
(male),
 
1
 
supervisor
 
(female)
 
and
 
2
 
moderators
 
were
 
employed
 
for
 
this
 
activity.
 
2
 
researchers
 
from
 
the
 
CMS
 
research
 
team
 
were
 
also
 
an
 
integral
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
team
 
and
 
were
 
present
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process,
 
closely
 
engaging
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions.
  
 
The
 
ﬁeld
 
teams
 
were
 
trained
 
on
 
the
 
survey
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
tools
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
translators
 
by
 
the
 
core
 
research
 
team
 
with
 
the
 
assistance
 
from
 
the
 
Field
 
Manager.
 
A
 
training
 
session
 
was
 
conducted
 
at
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
location
 
and
 
covered
 
the
 
following
 
topics:
 
background
 
of
 
the
 
project,
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study,
 
induction
 
to
 
SurveyCTO,
 
protocol
 
to
 
administer
 
the
 
questionnaire,
 
questionnaire
 
ﬂow
 
and
 
data
 
entry
 
dos
 
and
 
don'ts.
 
 
After
 
the
 
training,
 
we
 
conducted
 
pilot
 
surveys
 
at
 
a
 
couple
 
of
 
locations
 
with
 
active
 
assistance
 
from
 
the
 
core
 
research
 
team
 
to
 
identify
 
issues
 
if
 
any
 
and
 
incorporate
 
the
 
feedback
 
received
 
to
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
tool.
 
Utmost
 
care
 
was
 
taken
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
researchers
 
sensitized
 
to
 
conducting
 
interviews
 
with
 
female
 
respondents
 
while
 
leading
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
either
 
individual
 
or
 
group
 
of
 
female
 
respondents.
 
 
Both
 
the
 
KIIs
 
and
 
FGDs
 
were
 
conducted
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
and
 
place
 
convenient
 
for
 
the
 
respondents.
 
The
 
WWF
 
team,
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
PUM
 
and
 
FFs
 
assisted
 
CMS
 
in
 
planning
 
the
 
village
 
visits,
 
as
 
they
 
had
 
a
 
better
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
proximity
 
between
 
sampled
 
villages
 
and
 
respondent’s
 
time
 
preferences.
 
This
 
enabled
 
CMS
 
to
 
conduct
 
interviews
 
efﬁciently,
 
scheduling
 
them
 
back-to-back
 
and
 
minimizing
 
wastage
 
of
 
time.
 
Throughout
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
period,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
coordinated
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
to
 
understand
 
any
 
issues
 
faced
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
worked
 
to
 
resolve
 
them
 
shortly
 
after.

The
 
baseline

Challenges
 
faced
 
during
 
data
 
collection
 
Despite
 
the
 
support
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
WWF
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
in
 
planning
 
the
 
ﬁeldwork
 
and
 
mobilizing
 
the
 
respondents,
 
some
 
challenges
 
were
 
encountered
 
during
 
data
 
collection.
 
These
 
included
 
difﬁculties
 
in
 
ﬁnding
 
women
 
respondents
 
for
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
(as
 
per
 
the
 
sampling
 
requirements)
 
and
 
challenges
 
posed
 
due
 
to
 
language
 
constraints.
 
While
 
the
 
local
 
enumerators
 
recruited
 
by
 
CMS
 
were
 
well-versed
 
with
 
the
 
language
 
and
 
communicated
 
smoothly
 
with
 
the
 
respondents,
 
the
 
language
 
constraints
 
were
 
particularly
 
faced
 
by
 
CMS
 
researchers
 
who
 
do
 
not
 
understand
 
the
 
local
 
language.
 
However,
 
the
 
enumerators
 
took
 
care
 
to
 
translate
 
and
 
explain
 
the
 
points
 
being
 
discussed
 
in
 
the
 
interactions
 
to
 
the
 
researchers
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
the
 
interview.

The
 
overall
 
KPIs
 
of
 
the

can
 
broadly
 
be
 
divided
 
into
 
2
 
categories.
 
There
 
are
 
3

was
 
successful
 
in
 
achieving
 
its
 
speciﬁc
 
targets
 
and
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
scaled

for
 
collecting
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
crucial

had
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
reduce
 
environmental

help
 
farmers
 
strengthen
 
their
 
capacity,
 
which
 
also

the
 
farmers
 
on

principles
 
and
 
for
 
helping
 
them
 
bring
 
those

Although
 
both

are
 
ongoing
 
throughout
 
the

the
 
workload
 
for

ﬁnd
 
it
 
difﬁcult

with
 
doing
 
the
 
ground

data
 
collection
 
for
 
lists
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
farmers
 
list,
 
adoption
 
data
 
and
 
RIR.
 
Although
 
FFs
 
do
 
not
 
directly
 
input
 
data
 
into
 
the
 
RIR,
 
WWF
 
has
 
provided
 
them
 
with
 
simpliﬁed
 
data
 
collection
 
sheets.
 
These
 
sheets
 
make
 
it
 
easier
 
for
 
FFs
 
to
 
gather
 
accurate
 
information,
 
which
 
is
 
then
 
reviewed
 
by
 
the
 
PUM
 
and
 
digitized
 
for
 
ofﬁcial
 
use.
 
Apart
 
from
 
the
 
above
 
mentioned
 
lists,
 
the
 
FFs
 
are
 
also
 
maintaining
 
an
 
LG

Farmers
 
are
 
mandated
 
to
 
sign
 
the

Capacity
 
strengthening
 
of
 
Farmers
 
-
 
FFs,
 
on
 
an
 
everyday
 
basis,
 
conduct
 
CS
 
training
 
to
 
educate
 
the
 
farmers
 
on
 
an
 
array
 
of
 
topics
 
like
 
water
 
management,
 
biodiversity,
 
soil
 
health
 
management,
 
storage
 
of
 
cotton,
 
ways
 
to
 
increase
 
fertility
 
of
 
land,
 
reduction
 
in
 
water
 
pollution,
 
etc.
 
Nearly
 
20
 
to
 
30
 
farmers
 
typically
 
attend
 
these
 
training
 
sessions.
 
For
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
unable
 
to
 
participate,
 
the
 
FFs
 
make
 
personal
 
visits
 
to
 
their
 
homes
 
or
 
farms
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
are
 
informed
 
about
 
the
 
topics
 
covered.
 
Additionally,
 
FFs
 
follow
 
up
 
with
 
these
 
farmers
 
by
 
phone,
 
encouraging
 
them
 
to
 
attend
 
the
 
next
 
training
 
session.
 
For
 
these
 
trainings,
 
FFs
 
carry
 
communication
 
material
 
like
 
ﬂexes,
 
pamphlets,
 
stickers,
 
etc.
 
Out
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
material
 
aid,
 
FFs
 
believe
 
that
 
displaying
 
ﬂexes
 
is
 
very
 
impactful
 
and
 
helpful
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
to
 
understand
 
concepts
 
easily.

Community

activities
 
like
 
Rallies,

In
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
CS
 
training,
 
FFs
 
also
 
arrange
 
rallies,
 
demonstrations,
 
and
 
AV
 
shows
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
understand
 
the
 
Better

principles
 
better.
 
During
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
it
 
was
 
found
 
that
 
these

activities
 
have
 
a
 
huge
 
spillover

as
 
they
 
tend
 
to

often
 
leads
 
to
 
physical

detracts
 
the

task
 
they
 
ﬁnd

Facilitator

The
 
FFs
 
expressed
 
a
 
strong
 
preference
 
for
 
reducing
 
their
 
data
 
entry
 
workload
 
to
 
allocate
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
capacity-strengthening
 
activities,
 
such
 
as
 
training
 
farmers
 
on
 
sustainable
 
agricultural
 
practices.
 
Besides
 
aligning
 
to
 
their
 
personal
 
interests,
 
FFs
 
believe
 
that
 
these
 
interactions
 
provide
 
immediate
 
beneﬁts
 
to
 
farmers.
 
For
 
instance,
 
the
 
ﬁeld

unnecessary.
 
He
 
suggested
 
that
 
this
 
time
 
could
 
be
 
better
 
spent
 
training
 
farmers
 
who
 
cultivate
 
crops
 
like
 
maize,
 
paddy,
 
and
 
others
 
along
 
with
 
cotton.
 
Additionally,
 
he
 
also

collection
 
and
 
updation
 
is
 
a
 
time
 
consuming
 
process
 
which
 
takes
 
up
 
almost
 
15
 
days
 
annually
 
to
 
cover
 
all
 
the
 
villages
 
under
 
him.
 
 
 
FFs
 
recognize
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
data
 
in
 
monitoring
 
and
 
supporting
 
their
 
efforts,
 
understanding
 
that
 
it
 
plays
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
assessing
 
the
 
local
 
situation
 
and
 
tailoring
 
their
 
training
 
sessions
 
accordingly.
 
Despite
 
understanding
 
this,
 
FFs
 
are
 
eager
 
to
 
shift
 
the
 
balance,
 
by
 
spending
 
less
 
time
 
on
 
data
 
tasks
 
and
 
more
 
on
 
direct,
 
impactful
 
engagement
 
with
 
the
 
farming
 
communities.
 
 
Challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
FFs:
 
FFs
 
encounter
 
challenges
 
with
 
incorrect
 
data
 
and
 
delays
 
in
 
data
 
sharing,
 
often
 
requiring
 
time-consuming
 
follow-ups.
 
These
 
inaccuracies
 
can
 
compromise
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
related
 
data
 
sheets,
 
making
 
the
 
process
 
particularly
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
the
 
FFs
 
to
 
manage
 
effectively.
 
 
Suggestions
 
by
 
FF
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton:
 
FF
 
shared
 
that
 
they
 
rely
 
heavily
 
on
 
their
 
mobile
 
phone
 
for
 
nearly
 
every
 
task,
 
including
 
taking
 
photos
 
and
 
sending
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
PUM
 
daily.
 
This
 
constant
 
use
 
generates
 
a
 
large
 
amount
 
of
 
data,
 
which
 
often
 
causes
 
their
 
phone
 
to
 
lag
 
or
 
freeze.
 
They
 
suggested
 
19
 


 
that
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
beneﬁcial
 
if
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
could
 
provide
 
them
 
with
 
tablets
 
to
 
better
 
manage
 
these
 
tasks.
 
Additionally,
 
to
 
boost
 
female
 
participation,
 
FF
 
thinks
 
it
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
organize
 
additional,
 
separate
 
meetings
 
speciﬁcally
 
for
 
women
 
farmers,
 
addressing
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
encounter,
 
such
 
as
 
domestic
 
responsibilities
 
and
 
long
 
travel
 
distances.
 
Moreover,
 
incorporating
 
more
 
audiovisual
 
tools
 
into
 
training
 
sessions
 
can
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improve
 
farmers'
 
understanding
 
and
 
retention
 
of
 
the
 
material.
 
 
Producer
 
Unit
 
Managers
 
(PUM)
 
 
Each
 
PU
 
is
 
assigned
 
a
 
manager
 
(PUM)
 
who
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
overseeing
 
work
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
FFs
 
and
 
by
 
virtue
 
the
 
farmers
 
within
 
their
 
unit.
 
Every
 
PUM
 
has
 
an
 
assistant
 
PUM
 
(APUM)
 
who
 
helps
 
the
 
former
 
in
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
training,
 
documentation,
 
veriﬁcation
 
and
 
monitoring.
 
The
 
PUMs
 
are
 
primarily
 
tasked
 
with
 
managing
 
and
 
compiling
 
all
 
the
 
data
 
that
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
submitted
 
to
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
their
 
data
 
responsibilities,
 
PUMs
 
also
 
educate
 
FFs
 
on
 
various
 
topics
 
to
 
be
 
taught
 
to
 
farmers,
 
tailoring
 
the
 
content
 
to
 
the
 
local
 
context.
 
PUMs
 
daily
 
spend
 
half
 
an
 
hour
 
to
 
one
 
hour
 
with
 
the
 
FFs
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
challenges
 
they
 
are
 
facing
 
(if
 
any),
 
their
 
learnings,
 
etc.
 
PUMs
 
regularly
 
visit
 
the
 
ﬁelds
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
training
 
sessions
 
are
 
conducted
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
prescribed
 
format.
 
They
 
also
 
address
 
farmer
 
queries
 
and,
 
when
 
necessary,
 
visit
 
their
 
farms.
 
 
 
PUMs
 
handle
 
multiple
 
lists
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
and
 
have
 
to
 
strictly
 
adhere
 
to
 
the
 
timelines
 
speciﬁed
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
At
 
any
 
given
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
year,
 
PUMs
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
some
 
data.
 
As
 
the
 
deadline
 
for
 
any
 
data
 
list
 
approaches,
 
the
 
PUMs
 
often
 
ﬁnd
 
themselves
 
dedicating
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
to
 
completing
 
it,
 
sometimes
 
at
 
the
 
expense
 
of
 
conducting
 
farmer
 
training
 
sessions.
 
PUMs
 
mentioned
 
that
 
compiling
 
all
 
the
 
data
 
received
 
(from
 
the
 
FFs),
 
followed
 
by
 
cross
 
checking
 
and
 
correcting
 
duplicated
 
data,
 
is
 
a
 
laborious
 
and
 
complex
 
task
 
and
 
has
 
a
 
direct
 
effect
 
on
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
concentrate
 
on
 
farmer
 
training.
 
 
 
In
 
a
 
year,
 
PUMs
 
are
 
mandated
 
to
 
conduct
 
6
 
farmer
 
trainings
 
per
 
LG
 
and
 
conduct
 
around
 
3
 
to
 
4
 
special
 
activities
 
like
 
AVs,
 
demos,
 
etc.
 
PUMs
 
conduct
 
training
 
sessions
 
as
 
the
 
farmers
 
are
 
curious
 
to
 
know
 
about
 
new
 
methods
 
(like
 
PB
 
Knot,
 
Cremigel
 
etc.)
 
and
 
implement
 
it
 
in
 
their
 
ﬁeld.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
most
 
impactful
 
aspect
 
of
 
their
 
work,
 
PUMs
 
highlighted
 
their
 
preference
 
for
 
training
 
both
 
farmers
 
and
 
FFs.
 
They
 
emphasized
 
that
 
FFs
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
critical
 
link
 
between
 
the
 
farmers
 
and
 
the
 
ofﬁce
 
team,
 
making
 
their
 
education
 
essential
 
for
 
the
 
overall
 
success
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Apart
 
from
 
training
 
the
 
FFs
 
and
 
farmers,
 
PUMs
 
also
 
provide
 
special
 
training
 
to
 
anganwadi
 
workers,
 
ASHA
 
workers,
 
healthcare
 
workers,
 
pesticides
 
sprayers,
 
school
 
children
 
etc
 
on
 
the
 
relevant
 
principles
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
 
 
Apart
 
from
 
the
 
data
 
work
 
and
 
farmer
 
and
 
FF
 
training,
 
PUMs
 
also
 
do
 
some
 
level
 
of
 
administrative
 
work
 
like
 
recruiting
 
FFs.
 
Overall,
 
PUMs
 
allocate
 
5%
 
to
 
10%
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
to
 
administrative
 
tasks
 
and
 
30%
 
to
 
35%
 
to
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
activities.
 
However,
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
their
 
time,
 
around
 
50%-60%,
 
is
 
consumed
 
by
 
data-related
 
work.
 
While
 
FFs
 
collect
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
ﬁeld,
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
responsibility
 
of
 
the
 
PUMs
 
to
 
oversee
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process
 
and
 
check
 
the
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
reported
 
data.
 
At
 
least
 
20%
 
of
 
the
 
collected
 
data
 
is
 
veriﬁed
 
by
 
the
 
PUMs.
 
While
 
they
 
recognize
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
maintaining
 
accurate
 
data
 
records
 
as
 
proof
 
that
 
farmers
 
are
 
adhering
 
to
 
program
 
objectives,
 
they
 
expressed
 
a
 
preference
 
for
 
spending
 
more
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
They
 
believe
 
that
 
reducing
 
data
 
entry
 
tasks
 
would
 
not
 
only
 
increase
 
their
 
satisfaction
 
and
 
happiness
 
but
 
also
 
enhance
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
understand
 
and
 
address
 
the
 
challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
farmers.

At
 
the

level,
 
no
 
distinction
 
was
 
observed
 
between
 
the
 
work
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
FFs
 
and

and
 
raising
 
awareness
 
about
 
new
 
and
 
sustainable

practices.
 
 
 
Project
 
Coordinator
 
 
During
 
our
 
ﬁeld
 
visit,
 
we
 
spoke
 
to
 
Satish
 
Botla,
 
a
 
consultant
 
for
 
WWF
 
India
 
and
 
the
 
Project
 
Coordinator
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
in
 
the
 
Karimnagar
 
cluster.
 
He
 
handles
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of
 
responsibilities
 
including
 
both
 
administrative
 
and
 
technical
 
domains.
 
 
 
On
 
the
 
administrative
 
side,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
is
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
collection
 
and
 
organization
 
of
 
data
 
for
 
project
 
proposals
 
and
 
the
 
submission
 
of
 
annual
 
reports
 
to
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
He
 
regularly
 
conducts
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
typically
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
times
 
a
 
week,
 
to
 
monitor
 
project
 
activities,
 
review
 
progress,
 
and
 
ensure
 
compliance
 
with
 
project
 
goals.
 
His
 
administrative
 
duties
 
also
 
include
 
staff
 
recruitment
 
and
 
supervision,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
conducting
 
internal
 
reviews
 
where
 
he
 
discusses
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
with
 
PUMs.
 
Additionally,
 
he
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
cross-checking
 
documents
 
(like
 
adoption
 
data
 
and
 
RIR)
 
to
 
ensure
 
their
 
accuracy
 
and
 
completeness
 
before
 
they
 
are
 
submitted
 
to
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
or
 
other
 
stakeholders.
 
He
 
also
 
oversees
 
capacity-building
 
efforts,
 
planning
 
and
 
organizing
 
training
 
sessions
 
for
 
staff
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
skills
 
and
 
effectiveness.
 
 
On
 
the
 
technical
 
side,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
plays
 
a
 
key
 
role
 
in
 
planning
 
and
 
conducting
 
Training
 
of
 
Trainers
 
(TOT)
 
sessions
 
for
 
PUMs
 
and
 
FFs,
 
ensuring
 
they
 
are
 
well-equipped
 
to
 
educate
 
farmers.
 
He
 
does
 
not
 
deliver
 
any
 
direct
 
training
 
to
 
the
 
farmers.
 
He
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
developing
 
training
 
materials,
 
including
 
translating
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
principles
 
and
 
other
 
project-related
 
content
 
into
 
the
 
local
 
language
 
to
 
make
 
them
 
more
 
accessible.
 
Satish
 
also
 
plans
 
and
 
implements
 
training
 
programs
 
for
 
PUMs
 
and
 
FFs,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
content
 
is
 
contextually
 
relevant.
 
His
 
technical
 
responsibilities
 
extend
 
to
 
supporting
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
licensing
 
assessments,
 
where
 
he
 
ensures
 
that
 
WWF’s
 
implementation
 
aligns
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
He
 
also
 
develops
 
and
 
oversees
 
corrective
 
action
 
plans
 
as
 
needed,
 
reviews
 
project
 
activities,
 
analyzes
 
results,
 
and
 
establishes
 
detailed
 
monitoring
 
protocols
 
for
 
various
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
project,
 
such
 
as
 
FFBs
 
and
 
RIR.
 
 
In
 
his
 
role,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
allocates
 
approximately
 
20%
 
of
 
his
 
time
 
to
 
administrative
 
tasks.
 
Data
 
management,
 
which
 
includes
 
overseeing
 
the
 
Farmers
 
List,
 
Attendance,
 
Adoption,
 
RIR,
 
and
 
FFBs,
 
takes
 
up
 
25-30%
 
of
 
his
 
time.
 
Training
 
and
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
also
 
consume
 
35%
 
to
 
40%
 
of
 
his
 
time,
 
while
 
demonstrations
 
and
 
community-level
 
activities
 
account
 
for
 
5%
 
-
 
10%.
 
 
Greater
 
emphasis
 
should
 
be
 
placed
 
on
 
capacity
 
building.
 
We
 
have
 
an
 
overwhelming
 
amount
 
of
 
documentation
 
in
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
with
 
soft
 
copies
 
alone
 
ﬁlling
 
up
 
1
 
TB
 
of
 
storage.
  
For
 
years,
 
I
 
have
  
consistently
 
provided
 
feedback,
 
in
 
the
 
self-assessment
 
reports,
 
that
 
the
 
data
 
burden
 
on
 
PUMs
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
reduced,
 
allowing
 
them
 
to
 
focus
 
more
 
on
 
ﬁeldwork.&quot;

Project
 
Coordinator,
 
WWF
 
(Telangana)
 
Despite
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
portion
 
of
 
his
 
work
 
being
 
dedicated
 
to
 
data
 
and
 
capacity
 
strengthening,
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
believes
 
that
 
direct
 
engagement
 
with
 
ﬁeldwork
 
and
 
capacity
 
building
 
is
 
more
 
beneﬁcial
 
for
 
farmers
 
than
 
data
 
management
.
 
He
 
has
 
previously
 
discussed
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
the
 
21
 


 
excessive
 
level
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
required,
 
noting
 
that
 
the
 
data
 
burden
 
has
 
decreased
 
signiﬁcantly
 
compared
 
to
 
previous
 
years.
 
Now,
 
only
 
15%
 
of
 
farmers
 
in
 
a
 
PU
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
maintain
 
FFBs,
 
with
 
the
 
rest
 
participating
 
voluntarily.
 
Overall,
 
his
 
preference
 
is
 
to
 
devote
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
training
 
and
 
ﬁeldwork
 
rather
 
than
 
being
 
overwhelmed
 
by
 
data
 
tasks.
 
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
among
 
FFs,
 
PUM,
 
and
 
the
 
Project
 
Coordinator
 
to
 
allocate
 
more
 
time
 
to
 
impactful
 
work,
 
such
 
as
 
capacity
 
building,
 
rather
 
than
 
spending
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
their
 
time
 
on
 
data
 
entry
 
and
 
administrative
 
tasks.
 
By
 
focusing
 
more
 
on
 
these
 
meaningful
 
activities,
 
the
 
FFs
 
and
 
PUMs
 
can
 
engage
 
more
 
closely
 
with
 
farmers,
 
which
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
deepen
 
the
 
existing
 
relationships
 
but
 
also
 
attract
 
greater
 
interest
 
from
 
non-program
 
farmers,
 
encouraging
 
them,
 
especially
 
women,
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
Better

farmers
 
have

the

FFs
 
from
 
both
 
the
 
established
 
INTL01/02
 
and
 
the
 
newer
 
INTL23
 
provide
 
training
 
on
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
topics.
 
These
 
include
 
the
 
use
 
of

proper
 
handling
 
and
 
application
 
of
 
PPE

as

for

reported
 
following
 
the

Elaborating
 
on
 
the
 
program’s
 
reach
 
towards
 
women
 
program
 
farmers,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
women's
 
participation
 
as
 
program
 
farmers
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
is
 
extremely
 
low
 
at
 
present.
 
Although
 
a
 
typical
 
PU
 
includes
 
around
 
3000-3500
 
farmers,
 
~98%
 
are
 
men,
 
with
 
women
 
making
 
up
 
only
 
about
 
~2%-3%
 
of
 
the
 
cohort.
 
Field
 
observations
 
too
 
pointed
 
towards
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
women
 
participation
 
was
 
less
 
and
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
always
 
occupied
 
with
 
domestic
 
work
 
such
 
as
 
cooking,
 
cleaning
 
or
 
taking
 
care
 
of
 
children.
 
Interviews
 
revealed
 
that
 
women
 
struggle
 
to
 
balance
 
household
 
chores
 
with
 
farming
 
responsibilities,
 
with
 
them
 
naturally
 
opting
 
for
 
the
 
former.

The
 
primary
 
motivation
 
for
 
women
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
was
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
their
 
crops
 
and
 
ﬁnancially
 
support
 
their
 
households,
 
alleviating
 
the
 
ﬁnancial
 
burden
 
on
 
their
 
husbands.
 
Women
 
receive
 
full
 
support
 
from
 
their
 
family
 
to
 
do
 
farming
 
and
 
in
 
fact
 
even
 
take
 
some
 
farm
 
decisions.
 
It
 
was
 
observed
 
that
 
women
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
(old
 
and
 
new)
 
like
 
attending
 
training
 
as
 
the
 
sessions
 
are
 
engaging.
 
Women
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
follow
 
all
 
the
 
practices
 
that
 
are
 
taught
 
to
 
them.
 
Intercropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping
 
is
 
done
 
by
 
women
 
of
 
both
 
of
 
the
 
PUs
 
as
 
well.

When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
facilities
 
provided
 
during
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training,
 
the
 
women
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
provided
 
with
 
chairs,
 
water,
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
toilets.
 
Both
 
husbands
 
and
 
wives
 
could
 
speak
 
freely
 
in
 
the
 
meetings,
 
with
 
FFs
 
treating
 
everyone
 
equally
 
and
 
promptly
 
addressing
 
any
 
questions.
 
In
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
program
 
farmers'
 
FGDs
 
conducted,
 
the
 
women
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
INTL02
 
group
 
shared
 
that
 
they
 
pass
 
on
 
the
 
knowledge
 
gained
 
to
 
other
 
non-program
 
farmers,
 
which
 
has
 
helped
 
them
 
understand
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
using
 
organic
 
pesticides.
 
In
 
the
 
newer
 
INTL23,
 
women
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
share
 
or
 
discuss
 
any
 
information
 
learnt
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
with
 
other
 
non
 
program
 
farmers.
 
They
 
mentioned
 
that
 
when
 
they
 
try
 
to
 
share
 
their
 
knowledge
 
with
 
their
 
husbands,
 
they
 
are
 
often
 
dismissed
 
with
 
the
 
remark
 
that
 
the
 
husbands
 
already
 
know.
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
difference
 
observed
 
in
 
the
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
approach
 
of
 
INTL23
 
vis-a-vis
 
the
 
other
 
PUs.
  
Women
 
of
 
INTL23
 
seemed
 
less
 
motivated
 
and
 
not
 
inclined
 
to
 
adopt
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
prior
 
disappointing
 
experience
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
with
 
adoption
 
of
 
organic
 
practices.

Farmers

preference
 
for
 
their
 
children
 
not
 
to
 
pursue
 
agriculture,
 
citing
 
its
 
demanding
 
and
 
labor-intensive
 
nature.
 
 
 
However,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
clear
 
difference
 
between
 
the
 
old
 
and
 
new
 
PUs
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
personal
 
motivation
 
to

and

from

From
 
the
 
arguments
 
listed
 
below,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
concluded
 
that
 
women
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU,
 
INTL23
 
require
 
more
 
training
 
and
 
handholding
 
support
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
absorb
 
the
 
knowledge
 
shared
 
and
 
implement
 
those
 
practices
 
in
 
their
 
farms
 
thus
 
indicating
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff’s
 
efforts
 
towards
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
(especially
 
of
 
farmers
 
newly
 
joining
 
the
 
program)
 
are
 
necessary
 
and
 
required.
   
 
 
●
 
In
 
INTL02,
 
women
 
have
 
shifted
 
away
 
from
 
chemical
 
pesticides,
 
opting
 
instead
 
for
 
neem
 
oil,
 
vermicompost,
 
and
 
avoiding
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
chemical
 
cocktails
.
 
They
 
are
 
conscious
 
of
 
the
 
detrimental
 
effects
 
chemicals
 
have
 
on
 
both
 
soil
 
health
 
and
 
their
 
own
 
well-being.
 
Previously,
 
26
 


 
when
 
they
 
relied
 
on
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea,
 
DAP,
 
and
 
cocktails,
 
their
 
crops
 
suffered
 
damage.
 
However,
 
since
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
they
 
have
 
transitioned
 
to
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
leading
 
to
 
reduced
 
input
 
costs,
 
increased
 
yields,
 
and
 
consequently
 
higher
 
incomes.
 
●
 
Conversely,
 
while
 
farmers
 
in
 
INTL23
 
also
 
use
 
organic
 
fertilizers
 
such
 
as
 
neem
 
oil,
 
navdhanya,
 
and
 
biopesticides,
 
they
 
continue
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea
 
and
 
potassium,
 
including
 
cocktails.
 
Their
 
past
 
experiences
 
with
 
organic
 
methods
 
have
 
been
 
less
 
favorable,
 
resulting
 
in
 
low
 
trust
 
in
 
these
 
practices.
 
For
 
instance,
 
women
 
reported
 
trying
 
neem
 
oil
 
for
 
pest
 
control
 
but
 
did
 
not
 
achieve
 
the
 
desired
 
results.

Farmers
 
of

reported
 
that
 
soil

were

for
 
them
 
and
 
the
 
results,
 
which
 
came
 
after
 
15
 
days,
 
helped
 
them
 
decide
 
which
 
crops
 
to
 
grow.
 
Conversely,
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
reported
 
that
 
no
 
soil
 
testing
 
was
 
done
 
and
 
they
 
felt
 
clueless
 
about
 
what
 
to

and
 
which

to
 
use.

sessions
 
have
 
been

July
 
2024,
 
while
 
in
 
INTL02,
 
3
 
to
 
5
 
training
 
sessions
 
have
 
taken
 
place.
 
However,
 
in
 
INTL23,
 
no
 
demonstrations
 
or
 
rallies
 
have
 
been
 
organized
 
for
 
women,
 
whereas
 
men
 
have
 
attended
 
demonstrations
 
on
 
intercropping,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
navdhanya,
 
and
 
other
 
practices.
 
This
 
may
 
be
 
because
 
the
 
women
 
of
 
INTL23
 
are
 
only
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
evenings
 
or
 
at
 
night
 
when
 
their
 
household
 
chores
 
are
 
done.
 
In
 
fact,
 
they
 
have
 
suggested
 
scheduling
 
training
 
during
 
these
 
times
 
to
 
better
 
accommodate
 
their
 
availability.
 
 
●
 
Women
 
of
 
INTL02
 
reported
 
that
 
after
 
being
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
husbands
 
have
 
been
 
more
 
open
 
about
 
women
 
attending
 
training
 
sessions
 
or
 
venturing
 
outside
 
the
 
house
 
whereas
 
in
 
INTL23
 
women
 
saw
 
no
 
such
 
differences
 
in
 
agency.
 
●
 
When
 
program
 
farmers
 
were
 
asked
 
to
 
rate
 
the
 
extent
 
to
 
which
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
contributed
 
to
 
their
 
knowledge
 
and
 
awareness,
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL02
12
 
rated
 
it
 
as
 
‘Medium.’
 
They
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
enjoy
 
attending
 
the
 
trainings
 
and
 
appreciate
 
the
 
interactive
 
format,
 
which
 
keeps
 
them
 
engaged.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL23
 
rated
 
the
 
impact
 
as
 
‘Low,’
 
expressing
 
that
 
the
 
sessions
 
do
 
not
 
offer
 
any
 
new
 
or
 
signiﬁcant
 
information.
 
They
 
also
 
found
 
the
 
meetings
 
to
 
be
 
lengthy
 
and
 
time-consuming,
 
making
 
it
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
stay
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
duration
 
due
 
to
 
their
 
responsibilities
 
at
 
home
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁelds.
 
They
 
suggested
 
shortening
 
the
 
meetings
 
to
 
around
 
30
 
minutes.
 
 
 
Changes
 
in
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitude,
 
and
 
Practices
 
(KAP)
 
Related
 
to
 
Cotton
 
Farming
 
Farmers
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
have
 
experienced
 
changes
 
in
 
their
 
knowledge,
 
attitudes,
 
and
 
practices
 
related
 
to
 
cotton
 
farming.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL02,
 
have
 
greatly
 
reduced
 
their
 
use
 
of
 
heavy
 
chemicals,
 
recognizing
 
the
 
associated
 
health
 
risks.
 
This
 
awareness
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
both
 
yield
 
and
 
crop
 
quality,
 
with
 
market
 
rates
 
for
 
their
 
produce
 
rising
 
dramatically
 
from
 
Rs.
 
1,500
 
to
 
Rs.
 
1,800
 
per
 
quintal
 
before
 
the
 
program
 
to
 
Rs.
 
7,500
 
per
 
quintal
 
after
 
joining.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23,
 
too,
 
use
 
only
 
‘green
 
color
13
’
 
marked
 
pesticides.
 
 
 
The
 
adoption
 
of
 
intercropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping,
 
such
 
as
 
planting
 
yellow
 
gram,
 
has
 
become
 
common
 
practice
 
among
 
farmers,
 
optimizing
 
land
 
use
 
and
 
improving
 
crop
 
diversity.
 
Additionally,
 
13
Pesticides
 
are
 
classiﬁed
 
by
 
toxicity
 
level
 
using
 
a
 
color
 
code,
  
Red:
 
Extremely
 
toxic,
 
Yellow:
 
Highly
 
toxic,
  
Blue:
 
Moderately
 
toxic,
 
Green:
 
Less
 
toxic.
 
 
12
Farmers
 
were
 
chosen
 
either
 
from
 
INTL01
 
or
 
02
 
for
 
this
 
KPI.
 
Program
 
female
 
farmers
 
from
 
Bheempelli
 
village
 
of
 
INTL02
  
were
 
randomly
 
selected
 
for
 
this
 
discussion.
 
Respondents
 
from
 
INTL01
 
were
 
not
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
sample.
 
 
27
 


 
they
 
have
 
started
 
growing
 
two
 
crops
 
annually—cotton
 
and
 
vegetables—allowing
 
them
 
to
 
supplement
 
their
 
household
 
diet
 
and
 
reduce
 
expenses.
 
 
A
 
notable
 
shift
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
increased
 
adoption
 
of
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
reﬂecting
 
a
 
growing
 
emphasis
 
on
 
health
 
and
 
safety,
 
in
 
both
 
the
 
PUs.
 
This
 
improved
 
awareness
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
occupational
 
safety
 
and
 
health
 
(OSH)
 
along
 
with
 
an
 
increased
 
yield
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
adopting
 
the
 
program
 
promoted
 
approaches,
 
have
 
contributed
 
to
 
higher
 
ﬁnancial
 
returns
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
leading
 
to
 
an
 
enhancement
 
in
 
their
 
standard
 
of
 
living.
 
Many
 
women
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
purchase
 
items
 
like
 
TVs,
 
refrigerators,
 
bikes,
 
and
 
even
 
tractors.
 
However,
 
this
 
improvement
 
in
 
lifestyle
 
was
 
reported
 
only
 
by
 
the
 
INTL02
 
women
 
farmers.

Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL02
 
are
 
now
 
making
 
a
 
proﬁt
 
of
 
Rs.
 
20,000
 
to
 
Rs.
 
30,000
 
per
 
acre
 
per
 
season,
 
with
 
overall
 
expenditures
 
decreasing.
 
Over
 
the
 
past
 
ﬁve
 
years,
 
they
 
have
 
transitioned
 
from
 
using
 
harmful
 
pesticides
 
like
 
urea,
 
DAP,
 
and
 
chemical
 
cocktails
 
to
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
which
 
has
 
increased
 
their
 
income
 
while
 
reducing
 
fertilizer
 
costs.
 
This
 
comprehensive
 
shift
 
in
 
farming
 
practices
 
demonstrates
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
on
 
their
 
lives.
 
Non-program
 
farmers
 
(female)
 
Out
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
non
 
program
 
farmers
 
FGD
 
that
 
were
 
conducted
 
-
 
women
 
from
 
INTL01
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
attended
 
any
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
While
 
on
 
the
 
other
 
hand
 
two
 
out
 
of
 
eight
 
women
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
attended
 
ﬁve
 
to
 
six
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
trainings
 
in
 
the
 
past.
 
Women
 
who
 
could
 
not
 
attend
 
cited
 
reasons
 
like
 
either
 
tending
 
to
 
household
 
chores
 
or
 
training
 
timings
 
clashing
 
with
 
farm
 
timings.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
unanimously
 
agreed
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
provided
 
the
 
trainings
 
are
 
held
 
at
 
a
 
convenient
 
time.
 
Currently
 
the
 
trainings
 
are
 
not
 
held
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
when
 
they
 
are
 
available
 
and
 
therefore
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
attend
 
or
 
show
 
any
 
interest.
 
In
 
addition,
 
the
 
women
 
spoke
 
of
 
their
 
preference
 
for
 
separate
 
women-only
 
meetings
 
rather
 
than
 
mixed
 
meetings.
 
They
 
cited
 
uneasiness
 
and
 
uncomfort
 
with
 
male
 
participants
 
who
 
are
 
usually
 
intoxicated
 
by
 
the
 
evening.
 
 
28
 


 
Women
 
from
 
both
 
PUs
 
(old
 
and
 
new)
 
were
 
aware
 
of
 
important
 
practices,
 
such
 
as
 
avoiding
 
child
 
labor,
 
using
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
adopting
 
organic
 
methods
 
like
 
applying
 
sheep
 
and
 
cow
 
dung,
 
practicing
 
intercropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping,
 
and
 
avoiding
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
'red
 
color'
 
coded
 
(i.e.
 
harmful)
 
pesticides.
 
However,
 
they
 
were
 
unaware
 
of
 
pheromone
 
traps
 
and
 
relied
 
heavily
 
on
 
chemicals
 
for
 
their
 
farms.
 
When
 
asked
 
what
 
they
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
they
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
keen
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
methods
 
of
 
growing
 
cotton
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
good
 
quality
 
crop.
  
 
 
However,
 
clear
 
differences
 
between
 
program
 
and
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
were
 
evident.
 
Non-program
 
farmers
 
admitted
 
to
 
using
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea,
 
DAP,
 
potassium,
 
and
 
chemical
 
cocktails,
 
while
 
program
 
farmers
 
demonstrated
 
awareness
 
of
 
the
 
environmental
 
harm
 
caused
 
by
 
such
 
pesticides.
 
Additionally,
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
were
 
less
 
familiar
 
with
 
practices
 
like
 
using
 
pheromone
 
traps.
 
A
 
signiﬁcant
 
difference
 
observed
 
from
 
a
 
gender
 
perspective
 
was
 
that
 
non-program
 
women
 
farmers
 
were
 
less
 
informed
 
about
 
farm
 
activities,
 
including
 
the
 
costs
 
of
 
pesticides,
 
and
 
indicated
 
that
 
decision-making
 
was
 
primarily
 
handled
 
by
 
their
 
husbands.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
women
 
who
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
demonstrated
 
greater
 
independence,
 
actively
 
participating
 
in
 
decision-making
 
and
 
being
 
more
 
involved
 
in
 
farm
 
management.
 
 
 
Overall,
 
non-program
 
women
 
farmers
 
explicitly
 
expressed
 
interest
 
in
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
program,
 
however
 
with
 
the
 
condition
 
that
 
the
 
meetings
 
take
 
place
 
at
 
a
 
convenient
 
time.
 
 
Co-farmers

of
 
the
 
program
 
farmer
 
(listed
 
in
 
the
 
Better

program)
 
are
 
called
 
Co-farmers.
 
At
 
present,
  
there
 
are
 
about
 
1691,
 
2327
 
and
 
3075
 
co-farmers
 
from
 
INTL01,
 
INTL02

INTL23
 
who
 
have
 
beneﬁted

about
 
1501,

that
 
they
 
enjoy
 
attending
 
the

as
 
it
 
adds
 
to
 
their
 
knowledge
 
plus
 
they
 
get
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
other
 
farmers.
 
A
 
group
 
of
 
co-farmers
 
informed
 
that
 
till
 
date,
 
they
 
have
 
learnt
 
about
 
safety
 
and
 
precautionary
 
measures
 
like
 
using
 
gloves,
 
mask
 
and
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
inter
 
cropping
 
and
 
border
 
cropping
 
in
 
the
 
training.
 
The
 
co-farmers
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
did
 
not
 
ﬁnd
 
any
 
difference
 
in
 
the
 
way
 
the
 
FFs
 
engaged
 
with
 
the
 
program
 
farmers
 
and
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
and
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
FFs
 
are
 
very
 
proactive
 
in
 
addressing
 
their
 
queries.
 
They
 
informed
 
that
 
farmers
 
are
 
provided
 
with
 
chairs,
 
and
 
water
 
during
 
the
 
training.
 
Typically,
 
both
 
husband
 
and
 
wife
 
attend
 
the
 
meetings,
 
with
 
time
 
and
 
travel
 
distance
 
being
 
the
 
key
 
factors
 
inﬂuencing
 
their
 
decision
 
to
 
attend
 
the
 
training.
 
Co-farmers
 
reported
 
that
 
whatever
 
they
 
learn
 
in
 
the
 
meetings
 
are
 
shared
 
with
 
other
 
non-program
 
farmers
14
.
 
The
 
co
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL02
 
also
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
enjoy
 
ﬁeld
 
visits
 
more
 
than

The
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
is
 
evident
 
in
 
several
 
key
 
changes
 
reported
 
by
 
the
 
women:
 
●
 
Before
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
they
 
were
 
unaware
 
of
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
wearing
 
gloves,
 
a
 
practice
 
they
 
have
 
since
 
adopted.
 
 
●
 
The
 
program
 
also
 
shifted
 
their
 
approach
 
to
 
farming,
 
moving
 
them
 
away
 
from
 
using
 
chemicals
 
like
 
urea
 
to
 
more
 
sustainable
 
alternatives
 
such
 
as
 
compost
 
and
 
neem
 
oil.
 
They
 
noted
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
used
 
chemical
 
cocktails
 
for
 
the
 
past
 
3-4
 
years,
 
reﬂecting
 
the
 
long-term
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
training
.
 
 
●
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
farmers
 
have
 
experienced
 
a
 
decrease
 
in
 
ﬁeld
 
investment
 
costs.
 
They
 
attribute
 
these
 
savings
 
to
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
a
 
practice
 
strongly
 
encouraged
 
by
 
the
 
FFs,
 
which
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
lower
 
overall
 
expenses
 
compared
 
to
 
their
 
practices
 
before
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
 
14
 
It
 
was
 
observed
 
that
 
generally
 
women
 
are
 
the
 
only
 
ones
 
who
 
tend
 
to
 
share
 
info
 
with
 
their
 
male
 
counterparts
 
or
 
other
 
female
 
farmers.
  
In
 
some
 
PUs
 
we
 
saw
 
the
 
active
 
participation
 
of
 
both
 
male
 
and
 
females
 
(especially
 
in
 
Bheempelli)
 
-
 
there
 
was
 
interaction
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
and
 
they
 
took
 
decisions
 
together.
 
30
 


 
Over
 
the
 
past
 
few
 
years,
 
there
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
noticeable
 
increase
 
in
 
women’s
 
participation
 
in
 
meetings.
 
Previously,
 
their
 
husbands
 
were
 
reluctant
 
to
 
listen
 
to
 
their
 
input,
 
but
 
the
 
training
 
has
 
given
 
these
 
women
 
a
 
stronger
 
voice
 
and
 
inﬂuence
 
in
 
decision-making.
 
As
 
their
 
knowledge
 
has
 
grown,
 
so
 
has
 
their
 
authority
 
and
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
expressing
 
their
 
opinions.
 
This
 
was
 
reported
 
by
 
the
 
farmers
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs.
 
 
Co-farmers
 
of
 
INTL02
 
reported
 
gaining
 
greater
 
ﬁnancial
 
independence;
 
they

for
 
monetary
 
assistance.
 
This
 
newfound
 
autonomy
 
has
 
resulted
 
from
 
an
 
increased
 
participation
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
in
 
various
 
programs
 
organized
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
in
 
self-help
 
groups
 
and
 
focused
 
attempts
 
by
 
the
 
FF’s
 
in
 
engaging
 
speciﬁcally
 
with
 
the
 
Co-farmers
 
towards
 
enhancing
 
their
 
knowledge
 
along
 
with
 
their
 
socio-economic
 
empowerment,
 
has
 
contributed
 
to
 
an
 
overall
 
sense
 
of
 
empowerment
 
among
 
the
 
women.
 
They
 
particularly
 
appreciated
 
learning
 
about
 
intercropping
 
and
 
organic
 
fertilizers,
 
further
 
reinforcing
 
their
 
active
 
role
 
in
 
farming
 
and
 
decision-making.
 
Co-farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
take
 
help
 
of
 
children
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
during
 
holidays
 
for
 
simple
 
ﬁeld
 
tasks
 
(not
 
any
 
hazardous
 
activity)
 
and
 
that
 
they
 
ensure
 
that
 
it
 
does
 
not
 
hinder
 
their
 
education.
 
 
 
Thus,
 
program
 
farmers
 
have
 
found
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training
 
sessions
 
highly
 
impactful,
 
actively
 
applying
 
what
 
they
 
learn
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
farming
 
practices,
 
with
 
women
 
particularly
 
valuing
 
the
 
interactive
 
and
 
engaging
 
nature
 
of
 
these
 
sessions.
 
Meanwhile,
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
and
 
co-farmers
 
have
 
shown
 
a
 
strong
 
desire
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
eager
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
methods
 
for
 
improving
 
their
 
crop
 
quality.
 
Many
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
expressed
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
training
 
sessions
 
if
 
they
 
were
 
held
 
at
 
more
 
convenient
 
times,
 
highlighting
 
their
 
enthusiasm
 
to
 
gain
 
new
 
knowledge
 
and
 
practices.
 
Co-farmers
 
have
 
also
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
enjoy
 
attending
 
these
 
sessions,
 
appreciating
 
both
 
the
 
knowledge
 
gained
 
and
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
other
 
farmers.

Quantitative

from
 
the

sessions
 
and
 
the
 
subsequent
 
change
 
in
 
knowledge,
 
attitude
 
and

of
 
the
 
farmers.
 
While
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
(INTL01
 
and
 
INTL02)
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
had

informed
 
that
 
they
 
had

3
 
such

in
 
the

When
 
the

39
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL01,
 
32

were
 
enquired
 
about
 
the
 
concepts
 
that
 
they
 
learned
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions,
 
the
 
majority
 
indicated
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
learned
 
about
 
crop
 
rotation,
 
application
 
of
 
organic
 
manures,
 
conducting
 
soil
 
tests
 
and
 
installing
 
traps
 
in
 
the
 
trainings
.
 
Having
 
been
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
for
 
a
 
longer
 
duration,
 
a
 
higher
 
percentage
 
of
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
producer
 
units
 
(INTL01
 
and
 
02)
 
mentioned
 
learning
 
about
 
more
 
topics
 
concerning
 
sustainable
 
cotton
 
production
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
new
 
PU
 
(INTL23).
 
 
 
The
 
extent
 
of
 
adoption
 
of

is
 
also
 
relatively
 
higher
 
in
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
as
 
compared

This

corroborates
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
a

like

the

even
 
though

-
 
the

is
 
higher
 
than

These

by
 
the

The

also
 
revealed
 
learning
 
about
 
topics
 
such
 
as
 
proper
 
fertilizer
 
usage,
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
wearing
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
and
 
avoiding
 
harmful
 
pesticides
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions.
 
Farmers
 
from
 
INTL01
 
unanimously
 
agreed
 
that
 
videos
 
are
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
medium
 
for
 
learning
 
new
 
farming
 
techniques
 
and
 
concepts.
 
They
 
also
 
appreciated
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
are
 
held
 
at
 
convenient
 
locations
 
and
 
times.
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL01
 
do
 
not
 
practice
 
child
 
labour
 
as
 
they
 
want
 
their
 
children
 
to

In
 
contrast
 
to
 
the
 
positive
 
attitudes
 
and
 
practices
 
of
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PU,
 
farmers
 
from
 
INTL23
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
wear
 
PPE
 
kits
 
regularly
 
leading
 
to
 
health
 
issues.
 
Program
 
farmers
 
in
 
INTL23
 
further
 
stated
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
the
 
primary
 
decision-makers
 
and
 
consider
 
the
 
input
 
of
 
only
 
those
 
women
 
they
 
believe
 
to
 
be
 
knowledgeable.
 
They
 
also
 
acknowledged
 
that
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
has
 
empowered
 
female
 
farmers,
 
enhancing
 
their
 
knowledge
 
and
 
thereby
 
increasing
 
their
 
inﬂuence
 
in
 
decision-making
 
processes.
 
 
Farmers
 
who
 
joined
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
 
later
 
shared
 
that
 
their
 
decision
 
was
 
inﬂuenced
 
by
 
observing
 
the
 
progress
 
of
 
existing
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
particularly
 
in
 
reducing
 
pesticide
 
use,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
by
 
the
 
impactful
 
rallies
 
and
 
videos.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
both
 
co-farmers
 
and
 
other
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
have
 
become
 
increasingly
 
interested
 
in
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
When
 
asked
 
why
 
some
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
remain
 
uninterested,
 
the
 
farmers
 
explained
 
that
 
they
 
tend
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
rigid
 
mindset
 
and
 
are
 
generally
 
resistant
 
to
 
joining
 
any
 
programs.
 
 
More
 
than
 
70%
 
of
 
the

PUs
 
mentioned
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
happy
 
with
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
sessions.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
that
 
they
 
like
 
the
 
most,
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs
 
told
 
of
 
getting
 
to
 
learn
 
new
 
topics
 
(94%),
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
teaching
 
approach
 
of
 
the

provided
 
in

(91%).
 
Responses
 
of
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
new

(INTL23)
 
are
 
about
 
10%

the
 
older
 
PU
 
farmers
 
when
 
enquired
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
aspects
 
of
 
training
 
that
 
they
 
like.
 
 
More
 
than
 
70%
 
farmers
 
from
 
all
 
3
 
PUs
 
indicated
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
such
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
training
 
program
 
that
 
they
 
dislike,
 
however
 
a
 
smaller
 
percentage
 
of
 
farmers
 
did
 
mention
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
sessions
 
and
 
strict
 
adherence
 
to
 
program
 
practices
 
being
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
an
 
issue.
 
Higher
 
yield
 
and
 
improved
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton
 
were
 
the
 
main
 
beneﬁts
 
that
 
about
 
86%
 
and
 
57%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the

PUs
 
reported
 
from
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
Better

program
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
50%
 
and
 
20%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU.
 
Further,
 
more
 
than
 
80%
 
farmers
 
from
 
all
 
the
 
3
 
PUs
 
said
 
that
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
learn
 
improved
 
farming
 
techniques,
 
potential
 
increase
 
in
 
income
 
and
 
improvement
 
in
 
soil
 
health
 
are
 
35
 


 
the
 
primary
 
reasons
 
that
 
motivated
 
them
 
to

About
 
25%
 
of
 
the

from
 
the
 
3
 
PUs
 
stated
 
that
 
lack
 
of

the

(due
 
to
 
domestic

is
 
a
 
major
 
challenge
 
that
 
they
 
face
 
in
 
regularly
 
attending
 
the

sessions.
 
Again,
 
more
 
than
 
85%
 
farmers
 
from
 
the

PUs
 
(INTL01

that
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to

the

that
 
the

When
 
questioned
 
on
 
the
 
spillover

farmers
 
from
 
the

spoke
 
of
 
better

thus
 
enhancement
 
of
 
self-belief
 
as
 
the
 
major
 
positive
 
outcomes
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
experienced.
 
Responses
 
to
 
all
 
these

are
 
slightly
 
on
 
the
 
lower
 
side
 
for
 
INTL23
 
respondents
 
(as
 
compared
 
to
 
INTL01
 
and
 
02),
 
clearly
 
indicating
 
a
 
higher
 
need
 
of
 
training
 
and
 
facilitation
 
support
 
required
 
by
 
the
 
participants
 
from
 
the
 
newer
 
PU.
  
 
 
Differences
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
PUs
 
were
 
observed
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
women
 
participation
 
in
 
training
 
and
 
interest
 
in
 
maintaining
 
FFBs.
 
 
 
●
 
In
 
INTL01,
 
women's
 
participation
 
is
 
notably
 
low.
 
Out
 
of
 
the
 
130
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
in
 
a
 
village,
 
only
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
are
 
women
 
with
 
them
 
primarily
 
joining
 
the
 
program
 
after
 
the
 
recent
 
passing
 
of
 
their
 
husbands.
 
Despite
 
this,
 
these
 
women
 
actively
 
engage
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
and
 
also
 
participate
 
in
 
rallies.
 
Participation
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
INTL23
 
is
 
also
 
low
 
but
 
they
 
rarely
 
attend
 
meetings
 
due
 
to
 
their
 
commitments
 
to
 
domestic
 
and
 
agricultural
 
work.
 
 
●
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL01
 
showed
 
a
 
liking
 
and
 
interest
 
towards
 
maintaining
 
FFBs.
 
They
 
ﬁll
 
it
 
diligently,
 
either
 
themselves
 
or
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
their
 
children,
 
and
 
feel
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
useful
 
to
 
36
 


 
document
 
their
 
expenses.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
majority
 
of
 
them
 
do
 
not
 
maintain
 
FFBs.
 
 
Changes
 
in
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitude,
 
and
 
Practices
 
(KAP)
 
Related
 
to
 
Cotton
 
Farming
 
●
 
Previously,
 
farmers
 
relied
 
heavily
 
on
 
Monocrotophos
 
and
 
a
 
cocktail
 
of
 
harmful
 
chemicals,
 
spending
 
substantial
 
amounts
 
on
 
pesticides
 
but
 
achieving
 
very
 
poor
 
crop
 
yields.
 
Through
 
the
 
guidance
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
staff,
 
they
 
learned
 
to
 
not
 
indulge
 
in
 
such
 
hazardous
 
practices.
 
●
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
their
 
costs
 
have
 
decreased,
 
and
 
crop
 
yields
 
have
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improved,
 
leading
 
to
 
better
 
prices
 
in
 
the
 
market
.
 
While
 
farmers
 
once
 
faced
 
losses,
 
the
 
regular
 
support
 
and
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
program
 
staff
 
Ms.
 
Damayanthi
 
and
 
Ms.
 
Sony
 
have
 
enabled
 
them
 
to
 
conduct
 
soil
 
tests.
 
●
 
They
 
have
 
also
 
started
 
planting
 
green
 
grams
 
and
 
black
 
grams
 
as
 
intercrops
 
using
 
organic
 
fertilizers
 
produced
 
domestically
,
 
such
 
as
 
those
 
made
 
from
 
neem
 
trees.
 
Previously,
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
guidance
 
on
 
these
 
practices.
 
Now,
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
visits
 
and
 
meetings,
 
farmers
 
are
 
using
 
fewer
 
pesticides,
 
cultivating
 
intercrops,
 
and
 
improving
 
overall
 
soil
 
and
 
plant
 
health.
 
●
 
Farmers
 
of
 
INTL01,
 
reported
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
farmers
 
has
 
improved
 
since
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program
—they
 
have
 
purchased
 
chairs
 
for
 
their
 
homes,
 
educated
 
their
 
children,
 
and
 
upgraded
 
their
 
homes
 
from
 
Kaccha
 
(non-durable)
 
to
 
Pakka
 
(durable)
 
houses.
 
●
 
The
 
use
 
of
 
machinery
 
has
 
also
 
increased,
 
reducing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
manual
 
labor.
 
This
 
includes
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
tractors,
 
harvesting
 
machines,
 
and
 
even
 
cotton-removing
 
machines.
 
Farmers
 
of
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
mentioned
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
free
 
or
 
subsidized
 
PPE
 
kits.
 
Farmers
 
from
 
INTL23
 
have
 
expressed
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
enhanced
 
audio-visual
 
training
 
tools
 
and
 
improved
 
safety
 
materials
.
 
While
 
there
 
is
 
overall
 
satisfaction
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
some
 
farmers
 
of
 
INTL23
 
noted
 
that
 
not
 
all
 
recommended
 
practices
 
are
 
consistently
 
followed,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
PPE
 
kits.
 
Perspectives
 
of
 
Lead
 
Farmers
 
The
 
lead
 
farmer
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
educating
 
fellow
 
farmers
 
on
 
various
 
sustainable
 
agricultural
 
practices.
 
This
 
includes
 
teaching
 
about
 
bio-pesticides
 
(green
 
and
 
blue),
 
stem
 
applications,
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
intercropping
 
(with
 
crops
 
like
 
red
 
gram
 
and
 
green
 
gram),
 
pest
 
management,
 
and
 
border
 
crops.
 
They
 
advise
 
against
 
harmful
 
pesticides
 
like
 
Monocrotophos
 
and
 
promote
 
safer
 
alternatives.
 
The
 
lead
 
farmer
 
also
 
provides
 
guidance
 
on
 
precautions
 
related
 
to
 
water
 
resources,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
bio-fertilizers,
 
and
 
efﬁcient
 
crop
 
watering
 
methods,
 
such
 
as
 
alternating
 
the
 
watering
 
of
 
plant
 
rows.
 
Additionally,
 
they
 
emphasize
 
safety
 
measures,
 
such
 
as
 
wearing
 
gloves
 
and
 
masks
 
during
 
pesticide
 
application,
 
and
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
pheromone
 
traps.
 
 
Both
 
the
 
lead
 
farmers
 
interviewed
 
shared
 
the
 
common
 
goal
 
of
 
wanting
 
to
 
educate
 
their
 
fellow
 
farmers
 
on
 
best
 
practices
 
and
 
ensuring
 
that
 
they
 
also
 
beneﬁt
 
from
 
lower
 
investment
 
costs
 
and
 
higher
 
proﬁts,
 
just
 
like
 
they
 
did.

the
 
most
 
signiﬁcant
 
impact
 
in
 
educating
 
farmers
 
of
 
sustainable
 
cotton
 
farming
 
practices.
 
In
 
contrast,
 
the
 
lead
 
farmer
 
from
 
INTL01
 
mentioned
 
that
 
demonstrations,
 
rallies,
 
and

have
 
not
 
yet
 
been
 
conducted,
 
but
 
there
 
are
 
plans
 
to
 
implement
 
these
 
activities
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
Farmers
 
from
 
both
 
the
 
PUs
 
expressed
 
a
 
liking
 
towards
 
maintaining
 
FFBs
 
as
 
it
 
helps
 
them
 
track
 
their
 
expenses
 
and
 
income.
 
Interest
 
of
 
non
 
program
 
farmers
 
in
 
trainings
 
 
Farmers
 
are
 
highly
 
receptive
 
to
 
their
 
lead
 
farmers’
 
guidance
 
and
 
consistently
 
follow
 
their
 
advice.
 
In
 
INTL23,
 
even
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
are
 
actively
 
participating
 
in
 
the
 
training
 
sessions
 
and
 
have
 
expressed
 
interest
 
in
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
demonstrating
 
its
 
wider
 
appeal
 
and
 
inﬂuence.
 
Both
 
lead
 
farmers
 
actively
 
engage
 
with
 
non-program
 
farmers,
 
encouraging
 
them
 
to
 
join,
 
while
 
farmers
 
themselves
 
often
 
discuss
 
the
 
beneﬁts
 
and
 
drawbacks
 
of
 
new
 
methods
 
they
 
have
 
learned.
 
However,
 
the
 
lead
 
farmer
 
from
 
INTL02
 
noted
 
that
 
some
 
farmers
 
are
 
hesitant
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
program
 
due
 
to
 
concerns
 
about
 
attending
 
numerous
 
training
 
sessions
 
and
 
dealing
 
with
 
extensive
 
documentation
 
requirements.
 
Participation

women
 
In
 
both
 
the
 
villages,
 
women
 
were
 
actively
 
involved
 
in
 
farming
 
activities
 
such
 
as

tasks
 
like

The
 
lead
 
farmer
 
of
 
INTL02
 
mentioned
 
that
 
on
 
his
 
farm,
 
there
 
are
 
around
 
20
 
farm
 
workers,
 
with
 
women
 
earning
 
Rs.
 
500
 
per
 
day
 
and
 
men
 
earning
 
Rs.
 
800
 
to
 
1,000
 
per
 
day
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
more
 
labor-intensive
 
nature
 
of
 
their
 
work.
 
He
 
stated
 
that
 
male
 
and
 
female
 
workers
 
are
 
hired
 
for
 
doing
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
activities
 
associated
 
with
 
cotton
 
farming.
 
Men
 
are
 
paid
 
higher
 
rates
 
than
 
women
 
simply
 
because
 
the
 
work
 
they
 
do
 
is
 
physically
 
demanding
 
or
 
hazardous
 
like
 
carrying
 
cotton
 
bags,
 
plowing
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
or
 
spraying
 
pesticides
 
while
 
women
 
are
 
generally
 
involved
 
in
 
weeding
 
and
 
cotton
 
plucking.
 
These
 
rates
 
increase
 
during
 
peak
 
seasons.
  
 
 
Following
 
are
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
challenges
 
mentioned
 
by
 
lead
 
farmer
 
of
 
INTL23:
 
 
●
 
The
 
biggest
 
challenge
 
they
 
face
 
is
 
the
 
pink
 
bollworm,
 
which
 
signiﬁcantly
 
impacts
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton.
 
While
 
using
 
pheromone
 
traps
 
has
 
helped
 
somewhat,
 
the
 
problem
 
persists
 
as
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
effective
 
pesticide
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
to
 
combat
 
bollworms.
 
●
 
The
 
ﬂuctuating
 
prices
 
of
 
cotton
 
remain
 
a
 
major
 
concern.
 
●
 
The
 
government
 
usually
 
provides
 
red
 
gram
 
and
 
green
 
gram
 
seeds
 
free
 
of
 
cost,
 
but
 
it
 
wasn’t
 
done
 
this
 
time.
 
Impact
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
 
Since
 
joining
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program,
 
farmers
 
(especially
 
from
 
the
 
older
 
PUs)
 
mentioned
 
that
 
their
 
yield
 
per
 
acre
 
has
 
increased
 
noticeably.
 
Previously,
 
farmers
 
focused
 
solely
 
on
 
growing
 
cotton
 
throughout
 
the
 
year,
 
but
 
now,
 
they
 
have
 
diversiﬁed
 
their
 
crops
 
to
 
include
 
maize
 
and
 
yellow
 
gram
 
as
 
border
 
crops
 
as
 
well.
 
This
 
diversiﬁcation
 
has
 
not
 
only
 
boosted
 
overall
 
yields
 
but
 
has
 
also
 
allowed

the

also
 
shows
 
an
 
increasing
 
trend
 
from

Since
 
the

is
 
decided
 
based
 
on
 
the

the

On
 
the
 
whole,
 
the
 
cotton
 
production
 
landscape
 
in
 
the
 
project
 
area
 
has
 
seen
 
signiﬁcant
 
changes
 
in
 
recent
 
years,
 
with
 
some
 
farmers
 
transitioning
 
to
 
paddy
 
cultivation.
 
This
 
shift
 
is
 
largely
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
growing
 
preference
 
for
 
mechanization,
 
as
 
cotton
 
farming
 
remains
 
labor-intensive
 
in
 
comparison.
 
Despite
 
challenges,
 
there
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
consistent
 
overall
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
area
 
under
 
cotton
 
cultivation,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
volumes
 
harvested
 
and
 
licensed,
 
with
 
the
 
exception
 
of
 
INTL01
 
during
 
the
 
2022-23
 
period.
 
This
 
temporary
 
decrease
 
in
 
INTL01
 
could
 
likely
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
external
 
factors.
   
 
However,
 
the
 
positive
 
trend
 
in
 
other
 
regions
 
highlights
 
the
 
resilience
 
and
 
adaptability
 
of
 
the
 
farming
 
communities,
 
along
 
with
 
an
 
increased
 
number
 
of
 
farmer
 
participation
 
in
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
program.
 
The
 
increase
 
in
 
licensed
 
cotton
 
volumes
 
over
 
the
 
years
 
is
 
a
 
testament
 
to
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
in
 
optimizing
 
resource
 
utilization
 
and
 
ensuring
 
sustainable
 
practices.
 
This
 
is
 
further
 
expected
 
to
 
rise
 
post-PU
 
Rescoping
 
as
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
Better

volume
 
shall
 
be
 
fully
 
accounted
 
as
 
against
 
the
 
current
 
scenario
 
wherein
 
some
 
Ginners
 
spoke
 
of
 
having
 
to
 
mix
 
the
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
variant
 
in
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
the
 
sufﬁcient
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
.
 
Owing
 
to
 
issues
 
with
 
ginner
 
registrations
 
and
 
data
 
entry,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
uptake
 
in
 
the
 
supply
 
chains
 
has
 
seen
 
a
 
drastic
 
decline
 
from
 
2021
 
to
 
2023
 
(with
 
uptake
 
being
 
nil
 
in
 
2022-23
 
and
 
2023-24).

of

issues
 
along
 
with
 
consideration
 
of
 
an
 
entire
 
geographic
 
area
 
as
 
Better

will
 
ensure
 
considerable
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
overall
 
quantity
 
that
 
ginners
 
can
 
easily
 
segregate

and
 
project
 
coordinator,
 
the
 
Assurance
 
Coordinator
 
at
 
Better

and
 
a
 
Third

Veriﬁer.
 
 
Assurance
 
is
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
process,
 
taking
 
place
 
once
 
every
 
3
 
years
 
for
 
each
 
PU,
 
aimed
 
at
 
verifying
 
if
 
PUs
 
are
 
complying
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards
 
of
 
cotton
 
production
.
 
It
 
encompasses
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
activities,
 
including
 
licensing,
 
assessments,
 
and
 
data
 
veriﬁcation,
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
PUs
 
adhere
 
to
 
the
 
established
 
principles
 
and
 
criteria.
 
Under
 
assurance
 
there
 
are
 
data
 
related
 
compliance
 
requirements
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
licensing
 
of
 
the
 
PUs.
 
These
 
activities
 
are
 
generally
 
time-bound
 
to
 
ensure
 
timely
 
compliance.
 
 
●
 
Deﬁned
 
Compliance
 
Requirements:
 
Within
 
the
 
assurance
 
process,
 
there
 
are
 
data
 
related
 
compliance
 
requirements,
 
for
 
the
 
various
 
lists
 
such
 
as
 
farmers
 
list,
 
adjusted
 
ﬁgures,
 
RIR,
 
Self

data
.
 
These
 
requirements
 
are
 
integral
 
to
 
maintaining
 
the
 
integrity
 
and
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
collected.
 
●
 
Licensing
:
 
Assurance
 
activities
 
differ
 
between
 
new
 
and
 
existing
 
PUs.
 
For
 
older
 
PUs,
 
an
 
assessment
 
visit
 
is
 
conducted
 
before
 
granting
 
a
 
license,
 
which
 
is
 
typically
 
valid
 
for
 
three
 
years.
 
Once
 
the
 
license
 
is
 
nearing
 
expiration,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
conducts
 
a
 
re-assessment
 
to
 
renew
 
it.
 
●
 
Surveillance
 
Assessment
:
 
This
 
is
 
conducted
 
for
 
PUs
 
with
 
an
 
active
 
license,
 
particularly
 
when
 
there
 
are
 
changes
 
in
 
farmer
 
participation
 
or
 
if
 
a
 
red
 
ﬂag
 
was
 
raised
 
during
 
previous
 
visits.
 
The
 
surveillance
 
assessment
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
PU
 
continues
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
The
 
data
 
received
 
by
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
team
 
is
 
checked
 
for
 
its
 
quality.
 
Each
 
ﬁle
 
is
 
reviewed
 
for
 
proper
 
formatting,
 
correct
 
units,
 
and
 
duplication.
 
For
 
different
 
data
 
sets,
 
they
 
have
 
tailored
 
data
 
cleaning
 
exercises.
 
For
 
instance,
 
the
 
RIR
 
data
 
is
 
thoroughly
 
checked
 
by
 
the
 
MEL
 
Global
 
team,
 
while
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
team
 
performs
 
an
 
initial
 
review
 
to
 
catch
 
any
 
basic
 
errors
 
before
 
their
 
deeper
 
analysis.
 
 
The
 
assurance
 
team
 
comprises
 
two
 
sets
 
of
 
assessors—one
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
from
 
third-party
 
veriﬁers
 
(3PVs).
 
Currently,
 
four
 
organizations
 
are
 
empaneled
 
as
 
3PVs,
 
with
 
assessors
 
like
 
Lalit
 
leading
 
a
 
team
 
of
 
4-5
 
people
 
to
 
conduct
 
these
 
assessments.
 
PUs
 
are
 
notiﬁed
 
one
 
week
 
in
 
advance
 
of
 
an
 
upcoming
 
assessment.
 
A
 
template
 
outlining
 
the
 
requirements
 
is
 
shared,
 
and
 
PUs
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
submit
 
certain
 
documents
 
within
 
three
 
days
 
before
 
the
 
assessment.
 
The
 
third-party
 
veriﬁers
 
are
 
external
 
entities
 
brought
 
in
 
to
 
ensure
 
impartiality
 
and
 
objectivity
 
in
 
the
 
veriﬁcation
 
process.
 
They
 
conduct
 
a
 
thorough
 
review
 
and
 
assessment
 
of
 
activities
 
on
 
the
 
ground
 
within
 
a
 
limited
 
sample
 
size,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
practices
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
align
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
They
 
mainly
 
conduct
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
audits
 
-
 
Licensing
 
audits
 
to
 
assess
 
whether
 
PUs
 
meet
 
the
 
criteria
 
for
 
licensing
 
and
 
Surveillance
 
audits
 
to
 
assess
 
risks
 
and
 
ensure
 
that
 
PUs
 
continue
 
to
 
comply
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards
 
over
 
time.

Reporting
 
○
 
After
 
the

a
 
report
 
is
 
compiled
 
and
 
submitted
 
to
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
Team
 
and
 
the
 
global
 
assurance
 
team.
 
Licensing
 
decisions
 
are
 
made
 
by
 
these
 
teams.
 
○
 
3PVs
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
submit
 
their
 
reports
 
to
 
the
 
India
 
Assurance
 
Team
 
as
 
well.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
staff
 
and
 
3PVs
 
conduct
 
assessments
 
separately,
 
with
 
a
 
60:40
 
ratio—60%
 
of
 
assessments
 
are
 
done
 
by
 
3PVs,
 
and
 
40%
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
staff.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
staff
 
do
 
not
 
accompany
 
the
 
veriﬁers
 
at
 
all
 
times,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
independence
 
of
 
the
 
third-party
 
veriﬁcation
 
process.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supports
 
veriﬁers
 
with
 
date
 
coordination,
 
Point
 
of
 
Contact
 
(PoC)
 
arrangements,
 
and
 
also
 
provides
 
training
 
(annually
 
7
 
trainings)
 
-
 
both
 
online
 
and
 
ofﬂine
 
-
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
assessments.
 
 
There
 
are
 
64
 
indicators
 
which
 
the
 
PU
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
compliant
 
with,
 
and
 
non-compliance
 
with
 
even
 
one
 
of
 
these
 
indicators
 
results
 
in
 
the
 
loss
 
of
 
the
 
license.
  
It
 
was
 
understood
 
that
 
the
 
license
 
of
 
INTL23
 
is
 
pending
 
while
 
INTL01
 
and
 
INTL02
 
have
 
received
 
their
 
licenses
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
two
 
years.
 
Sampling
 
Methodology
 
and
 
Challenges
17
 
Sampling
 
is
 
primarily
 
used
 
during
 
Surveillance
 
Assessments
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
a
 
representative
 
portion
 
of
 
Producer
 
Units
 
(PUs)
 
is
 
evaluated
 
each
 
year.
 
The
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
conﬁrm
 
ongoing
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Principles
 
and
 
Criteria
 
(P&amp;C)
 
and
 
to
 
verify
 
that
 
any
 
previous
 
non-conformities
 
have
 
been
 
resolved.
 
Factors
 
considered
 
for
 
calculating
 
the
 
Sample
 
are:
 
●
 
New
 
Farmers:
 
PUs
 
with
 
over
 
33%
 
new
 
farmers
 
automatically
 
receive
 
a
 
mandatory
 
surveillance
 
assessment.
 
●
 
Non-Conformities:
 
PUs
 
that
 
had
 
a
 
high
 
rate
 
of
 
non-conformities
 
in
 
previous
 
assessments
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
selected
 
for
 
surveillance.
 
●
 
Regional
 
Balance:
 
The
 
sample
 
aims
 
to
 
achieve
 
a
 
balanced
 
distribution
 
across
 
different
 
Programme
 
Partners,
 
Local
 
Partners,
 
and
 
regions.
 
●
 
Risk
 
Factors:
 
Information
 
on
 
speciﬁc
 
risk
 
factors,
 
such
 
as
 
known
 
sustainability
 
issues
 
or
 
labor
 
violations
 
in
 
a
 
region,
 
inﬂuences
 
the
 
sampling
 
process.
 
●
 
Size
 
of
 
the
 
Sample:
 
The
 
total
 
sample
 
size
 
for
 
surveillance
 
assessments
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
cover
 
around
 
5%
 
of
 
licensed
 
Producers
 
globally
 
each
 
year,
 
although
 
this
 
may
 
vary
 
based
 
on
 
identiﬁed
 
risks.
 
Given
 
the
 
limited
 
three-day
 
timeframe
 
for
 
assessments,
 
interviewing
 
of
 
15
 
farmers
 
is
 
considered
 
a
 
fair
 
sample
 
size.
 
To
 
ensure
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
their
 
ﬁndings,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
also
 
conduct
 
Focus
 
Group
 
Discussions
 
(FGDs)
 
and
 
engage
 
with
 
local
 
resources,
 
such
 
as
 
pesticide
 
shop
 
owners
 
and
 
village
 
leaders
 
(sarpanch),
 
to
 
cross-check
 
information.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
assessors
 
claim
 
that
 
combination
 
of
 
15
 
farmers,
 
FGDs,
 
and
 
input
 
from
 
local
 
resources
 
provides
 
a
 
comprehensive

representative
 
sample.
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
the
 
3PVs,
  
Better
 
Cotton
 
provides
 
them
 
with
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
farmers,
 
out
 
of
 
which
 
they
 
select
 
15
 
farmers
 
using
 
purposive
 
sampling
 
based
 
on
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
gender
 
representation
 
and
 
geography,
 
irrigation
 
levels,
 
etc
 
to
 
be
 
surveyed
 
for
 
assurance
 
purposes.
  
 
The
 
assurance
 
team
 
is
 
experienced
 
in
 
communicating
 
with
 
farmers
 
and
 
familiar
 
with
 
the
 
local
 
geography,
 
which
 
facilitates
 
the
 
assessment
 
process.
 
The
 
selection
 
of
 
LGs
 
is
 
done
 
independently
 
by
 
the
 
assessors,
 
considering
 
factors
 
such
 
as
 
rain-fed
 
farming
 
practices,
 
landholdings,
 
gender,
 
geographical
 
distribution,
 
and
 
the
 
response
 
of
 
FFs
  
during
 
the
 
opening
 
meeting.
 
This
 
approach
 
helps
 
prevent
 
selection
 
bias,
 
while
 
their
 
objective
 
interviewing
 
techniques
 
mitigate
 
respondent
 
bias.
 
The
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
assessment,
 
including
 
its
 
duration
 
and
 
sample
 
size,
 
does
 
impose
 
some
 
limitations
 
on
 
the
 
assessors'
 
ability
 
to
 
cover
 
all
 
aspects
 
thoroughly.
 
However,
 
if
 
they
 
ﬁnd
 
that
 
three
 
LGs
 
are
 
insufﬁcient
 
or
 
if
 
results
 
are
 
inconclusive,
 
they
 
have
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
to
 
expand
 
the
 
sample
 
to
 
include
 
four
 
or
 
ﬁve
 
LGs.
 
The
 
3PVs
 
encounter
 
challenges
 
when
 
local
 
partners
 
fail
 
to
 
effectively
 
execute
 
their
 
responsibilities
 
and
 
provide
 
adequate
 
support,
 
resulting
 
in
 
delays
 
and
 
time
 
constraints
.
 
This
 
issue
 
is
 
particularly
 
pronounced
 
when
 
the
 
sample
 
includes
 
distant
 
locations,
 
such
 
as
 
villages
 
more
 
than
 
100
 
km
 
apart,
 
making
 
it
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
thoroughly
 
cross-check
 
farmers'
 
lists
 
and
 
other
 
data.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
3PVs
 
also
 
ﬁnd
 
three
 
days
 
insufﬁcient
 
to
 
conduct
 
in-depth
 
interviews.
 
The
 
3PV
 
further
 
added
 
that
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
helpful
 
if
 
data
 
pertaining
 
to
 
PUs
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
one
 
they
 
are
 
visiting
 
is
 
also
 
shared
 
with
 
them
 
so
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
holistic
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
they
 
are
 
visiting.
 
Currently,
 
the
 
narrow
 
scope
 
of
 
data
 
(shared
 
for
 
only
 
the
 
PU
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
visiting)
 
makes
 
cross-checking
 
difﬁcult
 
is
 
what
 
he
 
said.
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
there
 
have
 
been
 
instances
 
where
 
disqualiﬁed
 
PUs
 
or
 
LGs
 
simply
 
rebranded
 
themselves
 
while
 
retaining
 
the
 
same
 
farmers,
 
complicating
 
the
 
veriﬁcation
 
process
 
more.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
means
 
of
 
veriﬁcation
 
used,
 
the
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
Lalit
 
stated
 
that
 
the
 
FGDs
 
and
 
information
 
from
 
local
 
resources
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
validate
 
and
 
triangulate
 
their
 
ﬁndings.
 
Expectations
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
from
 
assessors
 
and
 
support
 
provided
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
team
 
expects
 
assessors
 
to
 
clearly
 
communicate
 
all
 
requirements
 
to
 
partners,
 
ensuring
 
they
 
fully
 
understand
 
what
 
is
 
expected
 
of
 
them.
 
Activities
 
should
 
be
 
planned
 
proactively,
 
providing
 
partners
 
with
 
sufﬁcient
 
notice
 
to
 
prepare
 
and
 
submit
 
the
 
necessary
 
information
 
on
 
time.
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
places
 
a
 
strong
 
emphasis
 
on
 
maintaining
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
data,
 
with
 
thorough
 
investigations
 
conducted
 
to
 
ensure
 
its
 
accuracy
 
and
 
reliability.
 
To
 
ensure
 
smoothness
 
in
 
the
 
assurance
 
processes,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
team
 
has
 
a
 
dedicated
 
Relationship
 
Management
 
team.
 
While
 
the
 
team
 
has
 
many
 
more
 
responsibilities,
 
the
 
one
 
relevant
 
to
 
this
 
project
 
include
 
maintaining
  
close
 
communication
 
with
 
WWF
 
(Telangana),
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
partners
 
receive
 
the
 
standard
 
protocols
 
necessary
 
for
 
compliance.
 
While
 
partners
 
are
 
given
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
to
 
design
 
their
 
own
 
meetings
 
and
 
training
 
calendars,
 
they
 
must
 
adhere
 
to
 
the
 
established
 
principles.
 
 
Risks
 
Considered
 
During
 
Assessments
 
To
 
mitigate
 
risks,
 
the
 
assurance
 
team
 
requests
 
partners
 
to
 
provide
 
them
 
with
 
suitable
 
dates
 
for
 
assessments,
 
as
 
they
 
previously
 
encountered
 
scheduling
 
conﬂicts
 
with
 
local
 
festivals.
 
Recently,
 
one
 
PU
 
informed
 
them
 
of
 
stafﬁng
 
issues,
 
where
 
all
 
had
 
been
 
terminated,
 
leading
 
them
 
to
 
request
 
an
 
extension.
 
In
 
such
 
cases,
 
they
 
evaluate
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
key
 
staff
 
members.
 
If
 
a
 
particular
 
staff
 
member
 
is
 
not
 
crucial
 
to
 
the
 
assessment,
 
they
 
proceed
 
as
 
planned.
 
Additionally,
 
weather
 
conditions
 
46
 


 
can
 
affect
 
the
 
process,
 
as
 
farmers
 
are
 
often
 
less
 
willing
 
to
 
engage
 
during
 
unfavorable
 
weather.
 
These
 
factors
 
are
 
carefully
 
considered
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
the
 
assessments.
 
Before
 
the
 
assessment,
 
3PVs
 
do
 
a
 
risk
 
proﬁling,
 
wherein
 
they
 
conduct
 
interviews
 
with
 
three
 
independent
 
stakeholders
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
directly
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
PU
 
(e.g.,
 
KVK,
 
Sarpanch,
 
school
 
teachers)
 
without
 
informing
 
the
 
PU.
 
These
 
interviews
 
provide
 
valuable
 
insights
 
into
 
potential
 
risks
 
and
 
issues,
 
such
 
as
 
child
 
labor,
 
farmer
 
suicides,
 
and
 
other
 
sector-speciﬁc
 
challenges,
 
which
 
helps
 
them
 
be
 
better
 
prepared
 
for
 
the
 
assessment
.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
3PVs
 
conduct
 
daily
 
cross-checks
 
and
 
data
 
triangulation
 
using
 
secondary
 
sources
 
and
 
historical
 
data
 
throughout
 
the
 
assessment
 
process.
 
This
 
approach
 
allows
 
them
 
to
 
address
 
and
 
clarify
 
any
 
discrepancies
 
in
 
real-time
 
during
 
the
 
assessment.
 
Factors
 
Contributing
 
to
 
Non-Compliance
 
Among
 
Farmers
 
The
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
mentioned
 
non-compliance
 
was
 
observed
 
amongst
 
few
 
farmers
 
of
 
the
 
PUs.
 
He
 
stated
 
that
 
several
 
factors
 
contribute
 
to
 
non-compliance
 
among
 
farmers.
 
One
 
signiﬁcant
 
issue
 
is
 
the
 
adoption
 
of
 
PPE
 
kits,
 
which
 
they
 
encourage
 
for
 
safety,
 
but
 
farmers
 
often
 
avoid
 
using
 
them
 
because
 
they
 
feel
 
uncomfortable
 
using
 
them
 
in
 
unfavorable
 
weather
 
conditions.
 
Additionally,
 
extension
 
agents
 
or
 
pesticide
 
vendors
 
sometimes
 
advise
 
farmers
 
to
 
mix
 
chemicals,
 
leading
 
to
 
practices
 
that
 
go
 
against
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
guidelines.
 
Another
 
challenge
 
is
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
certain
 
chemicals
 
banned
 
by
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
like
 
monocrotophos,
 
which
 
farmers
 
continue
 
to
 
use
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
inexpensive
 
and
 
readily
 
available.
 
To
 
combat
 
these
 
issues,
 
the
 
assurance
 
team
 
have
 
launched
 
campaigns
18
 
aimed
 
at
 
discouraging
 
such
 
non-compliant
 
behaviors
 
and
 
promoting
 
safer,
 
compliant
 
practices.
 
 
Level
 
of
 
Conﬁdence
 
in
 
Assurance
 
Results
 
 
While
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
assurance
 
process
 
beyond
 
the
 
risks
 
previously
 
mentioned,
 
the
 
remote
 
locations
 
of
 
some
 
LGs
 
can
 
make
 
travel
 
between
 
farmer
 
households
 
time-consuming
 
and
 
logistically
 
challenging,
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
3PVs
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
team.
 
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
how
 
the
 
existing
 
assurance
 
systems
 
and
 
processes
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
mitigate
 
the
 
risks
 
associated
 
with
 
free
 
riders
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
Lalit
 
mentioned
 
that
 
given
 
the
 
resource
 
constraints,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
feasible
 
to
 
have
 
comprehensive
 
details
 
on
 
all
 
farmers.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
free
 
riders
 
cannot
 
be
 
entirely
 
eliminated,
 
even
 
within
 
the
 
PURE
 
framework.
 
Although
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
PURE
 
is
 
not
 
to
 
completely
 
eliminate
 
free
 
riders
 
but
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
risk—keeping
 
it
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
level
 
or
 
reducing
 
it
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
approach—the
 
process
 
requires
 
ongoing
 
monitoring
 
and
 
adaptive
 
strategies
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
framework
 
remains
 
effective
 
in
 
curbing
 
free
 
rider
 
behavior
 
without
 
compromising
 
the
 
overall
 
goals
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
Despite
 
these
 
limitations,
 
he
 
stated
 
that
 
their
 
assurance
 
mechanisms
 
strive
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
such
 
risks
 
by
 
implementing
 
rigorous
 
checks
 
and
 
balances,
 
though
 
the
 
challenge
 
of
 
fully
 
eliminating
 
non-compliance
 
persists.
 
 
To
 
summarize,
 
the
 
assurance
 
coordinator
 
has
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
processes
 
related
 
to
 
assurance
,
 
as
 
seen
 
from
 
the
 
table
 
below.

Once
 
the

is
 
collected
 
from
 
the

it
 
is
 
the

of
 
the

to
 
check
 
and

it
 
before

While
 
speaking
 
to
 
the
 
PUMs,
 
it
 
was
 
understood
 
that
 
under
 
MEL
 
processes,
 
cross-checking
 
is
 
a
 
critical
 
component
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
responsible
 
for.
 
For
 
each
 
document,
 
a
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
is
 
reviewed
 
to
 
ensure
 
accuracy.
 
Typically,
 
10%
 
to
 
20%
 
of
 
data
 
from
 
each
 
FF
 
is
 
considered.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
an
 
FF
 
oversees
 
four
 
villages,
 
10%
 
of
 
data
 
from
 
each
 
village
 
is
 
sampled
 
and
 
cross-checked
 
by
 
the
 
PUM.
 
The
 
percentage
 
of
 
cross-checked
 
data
 
varies:
 
10%-20%
 
for
 
larger
 
populations
 
and
 
5%-10%
 
for
 
smaller
 
ones,
 
a
 
standard
 
set
 
decided
 
internally
 
by
 
WWF.
 
Typically,
 
the
 
APUM
 
checks
 
40%
 
to
 
50%
 
of
 
data,
 
the
 
PUM
 
checks
 
10%,
 
and
 
the
 
project
 
coordinator
 
checks

The

here
 
is

by
 
the
 
PUM
 
for

activities,
 
even
 
though
 
it

As
 
per
 
the
 
PUMs,
 
this
 
rigorous

is
 
reliable,
 
as
 
any
 
identiﬁed
 
issues
 
are
 
further
 
cross-checked
 
by
 
the
 
FF
 
to
 
ensure
 
accuracy.
 
The
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
MEL
 
activities,
 
for
 
PUMs,
 
varies
 
with
 
the
 
season.
 
Currently,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
PUM
 
is
 
focusing
 
on
 
preparing
 
farmers'
 
lists,
 
which
 
takes
 
about
 
1-2
 
weeks.
 
Her
 
workload
 
will
 
shift

while
 
the

faces
 
no

PUM
 
of
 
INTL23
 
mentioned
 
that
 
meeting
 
strict
 
deadlines
 
is
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenge,
 
especially
 
when
 
farmers
 
delay
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
necessary
 
data.
 
This
 
delay
 
also
 
makes
 
it
 
difﬁcult
 
for
 
FFs
 
to
 
collect
 
data
 
on
 
time.
 
However,
 
these
 
challenges
 
do
 
not
 
impact
 
the

the

mentioned
 
that
 
it

instead
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
practice
 
of
 
checking
 
only
 
10%.
 
However,
 
she
 
later
 
added
 
that
 
since
 
PUMs
 
are
 
burdened
 
with
 
data
 
work,
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
cross-checks
 
is
 
kept

Overview
 
of
 
work
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
Senior
 
Coordinator,
 
Global
 
MEL,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
MEL
 
along
 
with
 
another
 
coordinator
 
is
 
essentially
 
responsible
 
for
 
looking
 
after
 
two
 
data
 
sets
 
-
 
the
 
Reach
 
Data
 
(covering
 
area,
 
number
 
of
 
farmers,
 
and
 
production)
 
and
 
the
 
Result
 
Indicators
 
Report
 
(RIR)
 
data
,
 
which
 
involves
 
collecting
 
data
 
from
 
sampled
 
farmers
 
to
 
assess
 
factors
 
like
 
water
 
and
 
pesticide
 
usage
 
(organic
 
versus
 
chemical
 
etc).
  
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
receives
 
the
 
RIR
 
data
 
12
 
weeks
 
after
 
harvest,
 
after
 
which
 
she
 
conducts
 
a
 
gap
 
analysis
 
to
 
ensure
 
completeness
 
and
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
data,
 
checking
 
for
 
inconsistencies
 
such
 
as
 
irrigated
 
area
 
exceeding
 
cultivated
 
area
 
or
 
missing
 
pesticide
 
details.
 
If
 
issues
 
arise,
 
partners
 
are
 
contacted
 
for
 
clariﬁcation.
 
Data
 
is
 
recorded
 
in
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
format,
 
moving
 
from
 
FFB
 
to
 
the
 
RIR,
 
with
 
potential
 
issues
 
ﬂagged
 
during
 
gap
 
analysis.
 
Following
 
the
 
gap
 
analysis,
 
an
 
outlier
 
check
 
is
 
done
 
to
 
identify
 
data
 
points
 
that
 
are
 
signiﬁcantly
 
different
 
from
 
the
 
average
 
values,
 
for
 
instance,
 
the
 
average
 
cotton
 
yield
 
of
 
each
 
PU
 
is
 
compared
 
to
 
individual
 
farm
 
yields.
 
Signiﬁcant
 
discrepancies,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
PU
 
cotton
 
yield
 
of
 
135
 
kg/ha
 
versus
 
a
 
farm
 
yield
 
of
 
1000
 
kg/ha,
 
prompt
 
further
 
investigation,
 
which
 
may
 
reveal
 
either
 
data
 
errors
 
or
 
genuine
 
issues.
 
This
 
process
 
involves
 
extensive
 
coordination
 
between
 
country
 
MEL,
 
global
 
MEL,
 
and
 
the
 
partners.
 
It
 
was
 
also
 
mentioned
 
that
 
the
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
handles
 
-
 
Cotton
 
Cloud,
 
a
 
power
 
BI
 
dashboard
 
that
 
is
 
developed
 
in-house
 
to
 
keep
 
a

of
 
the
 
how
 
much
 
chemicals/pesticides
 
PUs
 
have
 
used,
 
income
 
variation
 
across
 
seasons,
 
etc.
 
The
 
data
 
ﬂow
 
from
 
farmers
 
to
 
the
 
RIR
 
involves
 
changing
 
hands
 
multiple
 
times:
 
FFBs
 
managed
 
by
 
FFs,
 
oversight
 
by
 
PUMs
 
and
 
MEL
 
personnel
 
at
 
the
 
partner
 
level,
 
and
 
ﬁnal
 
aggregation
 
by
 
partners
 
in
 
internal
 
Excel
 
sheets
 
before
 
being
 
entered
 
into
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
mandated
 
RIR
 
excel
 
sheet.
 
PUMs
 
typically
 
complete
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
entry
 
for
 
RIR
 
with
 
assistance
 
from

Contextual
 
Information:
 
Introduced
 
three
 
years
 
ago,
 
it
 
includes
 
questions
 
at
 
the
 
PU
 
level,
 
such
 
as
 
whether
 
water
 
levels
 
or
 
costs
 
were
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
previous
 
year.
 
This
 
contextual
 
data
 
helps
 
explain
 
anomalies
 
or
 
outliers
 
in
 
the
 
other
 
reports.
 
These
 
reports
 
are
 
essential
 
for
 
tracking
 
the
 
progress
 
and
 
compliance
 
of
 
PUs
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
standards.
 
Timeliness
 
of
 
Data
 
Reporting
 
Generally,
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
signiﬁcant
 
delays
 
from
 
the
 
partner
 
WWF,
 
as
 
the
 
reporting
 
deadline
 
is
 
three
 
months
 
after
 
the
 
harvest.
 
WWF
 
typically
 
reports
 
diligently
 
and
 
on
 
time.
 
However,
 
when
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
requests
 
clariﬁcations,
 
it
 
often
 
takes
 
time
 
for
 
partners
 
to
 
respond.
 
Despite
 
this,
 
the
 
actual
 
sharing
 
of
 
the
 
RIR
 
(Result
 
Indicators
 
Report)
 
typically
 
meets
 
deadlines.
 
Rectifying
 
Data
 
Collection
 
and
 
Entry
 
Errors
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
also
 
mentioned
 
a
 
common
 
issue
 
that
 
many
 
farmers
 
within
 
a
 
PU
 
face
 
-
 
they
 
report
 
the
 
same
 
yield,
 
which
 
raises
 
concerns
 
about
 
accuracy.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
due
 
to
 
guesstimating,
 
but
 
in
 
some
 
cases,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
genuine,
 
as
 
nearby
 
farmers
 
experience
 
the
 
same
 
climatic
 
conditions
 
and
 
pest
 
attacks.
 
There’s
 
also
 
the
 
challenge
 
of
 
units
 
of
 
land
 
size
 
conversion.
 
Farmers
 
often
 
know
 
their
 
land
 
size
 
in
 
bigha,
 
but
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
requires
 
data
 
in
 
hectares
 
(ha),
 
leading
 
to
 
potential
 
inaccuracies
 
during
 
conversion.
 
Similarly,
 
fertilizers
 
are
 
sometimes
 
reported
 
in
 
milliliters
 
(ML)
 
rather
 
than
 
kilograms,
 
causing
 
further
 
complications.
 
Another
 
issue
 
that
 
is
 
reported
 
is
 
that
 
small
 
farmers
 
not
 
having
 
weighing
 
machines,
 
do
 
not
 
always
 
know
 
how
 
much
 
cotton
 
they
 
have
 
produced
 
and
 
sold.
 
It
 
is
 
then
 
recommended
 
that
 
FFs
 
check
 
sale
 
receipts
 
to
 
ensure
 
accurate
 
reporting.
 
Sampling
 
Methodology
 
&amp;
 
its
 
representativeness
 
 
Prior
 
to
 
COVID-19,
 
the
 
sampling
 
methodology
 
for
 
selecting
 
farmers
 
included
 
two
 
types:
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
and
 
Lead
 
farmers,
 
with
 
every
 
LG
 
having
 
one
 
Lead
 
farmer.
 
The
 
sampling
 
approach
 
involved
 
using
 
a
 
95%
 
conﬁdence
 
interval
 
and
 
a
 
5%
 
margin
 
of
 
error.
 
For
 
a
 
PU
 
with
 
around
 
3,500
 
farmers,
 
this
 
meant
 
selecting
 
500
 
to
 
600
 
farmers,
 
including
 
all
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
(100
 
to
 
125)
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers.
 
The
 
methodology
 
involved
 
randomly
 
selecting
 
10
 
LGs
 
out
 
of
 
100
 
for
 
any
 
given
 
PU,
 
and
 
then
 
choosing
 
all
 
farmers
 
within
 
those
 
selected
 
LGs,
 
amounting
 
to
 
about
 
350
 
farmers.
 
The
 
remaining
 
90
 
LGs
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
select
 
Lead
 
farmers.
 
The
 
senior
 
coordinator
 
informed
 
that
 
this
 
sampling
 
approach,
 
while
 
focused
 
on
 
ensuring
 
a
 
representative
 
analysis
 
of
 
LGs,
 
had
 
its
 
ﬂaws.
 
The
 
unit
 
of
 
analysis
 
was
 
the
 
PU,
 
and
 
while
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
were
 
randomly
 
selected,
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
were
 
not.
 
This
 
created
 
a
 
methodological
 
ﬂaw,
 
as
 
comparisons
 
between
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
between
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
within
 
the
 
same
 
PU
 
were
 
made
.
 
Despite
 
these
 
issues,
 
only
 
comparisons
 
between
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
were
 
reported
 
externally,
 
as
 
the
 
sampling
 
of
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
was
 
not
 
random.
 
Post
 
COVID-19,
 
the
 
sampling
 
methodology
 
was
 
adjusted.
 
From
 
2020
 
to
 
2023,
 
the
 
sampling
 
methodology
 
mandated
 
that
 
the
 
conﬁdence
 
interval
 
remain
 
at
 
95%,
 
but
 
the
 
margin
 
of
 
error
 
be
 
increased
 
to
 
10%,
 
reducing
 
the
 
effective
 
sample
 
size
 
to
 
200
 
farmers
 
per
 
PU
 
-
 
100
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
and
 
100
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
.
 
The
 
new
 
methodology
 
involved
 
randomly
 
selecting
 
10
 
LGs,
 
from
 
which
 
9
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
were
 
randomly
 
chosen,
 
plus
 
1
 
Lead
 
farmer
 
from
 
the
 
remaining
 
LGs,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
200
 
farmers.
 
 
52
 


 
While
 
50%
 
of
 
the
 
PUs
 
continued
 
with
 
this
 
same
 
approach,
 
for
 
the
 
remaining
 
50%
 
another
 
pilot
 
was
 
launched
 
in
 
2023-24,
 
which
 
aimed
 
at
 
reducing
 
the
 
workload
 
burden
 
from
 
FFs
 
which
 
meant
 
reducing
 
the
 
FFB
 
distribution
 
and
 
monitoring
 
support
 
to
 
only
 
5
 
farmers
 
each
 
LG
 
based
 
on
 
feedback
 
that
 
too
 
much
 
time
 
was
 
spent
 
on
 
this
 
task.
 
The
 
adjustments
 
made
 
post
 
COVID-19
 
have
 
increased
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
methodology,
 
making
 
it
 
more
 
representative.
 
However,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
suggestion
 
that
 
the
 
selection
 
of
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
should
 
have
 
been
 
scrapped
 
altogether
 
to
 
further
 
improve
 
the
 
MEL
 
process.
 
Lead
 
farmers
 
were
 
not
 
randomly
 
selected,
 
unlike
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
which
 
introduces
 
bias
 
in
 
the
 
comparisons
 
between
 
Lead
 
farmers,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers,
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers.
 
This
 
non-random
 
selection
 
undermines
 
the
 
representativeness
 
and
 
reliability
 
of
 
the
 
sampling
 
process.
 
 
Overall,
 
she
 
could
 
only
 
rate
 
her
 
conﬁdence
 
in
 
the
 
MEL
 
approach
 
for
 
the
 
RIR
 
data,
 
as
 
that
 
is
 
her
 
primary
 
area
 
of
 
responsibility.
 
The
 
‘level

is
 
on
 
a

with

being

Strengthening
 
the
 
Supply
 
Chain
 
and
 
Marketing
 
Dynamics
 
The
 
marketing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
traditionally
 
relied
 
on
 
a
 
strong
 
and
 
grounded
 
supply
 
chain
 
connection
 
directly
 
between
 
farmers
 
and
 
the
 
ginners,
 
most
 
of
 
whom
 
are
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
registered.
 
Although
 
some
 
disruptions
 
have
 
been
 
noted,
 
particularly
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
that
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
have
 
in
 
choosing
 
where
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
(depending
 
on
 
price
 
or
 
already
 
established
 
connections
 
with
 
local
 
traders),
 
the
 
overall
 
volumes
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
eligible
 
for
 
licensing
 
have
 
continued
 
to
 
rise.

Over
 
the
 
years,
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
witnessed
 
a
 
steady
 
and
 
positive
 
uptake
 
across
 
various
 
regions,
 
reﬂecting
 
stability
 
and
 
growth
 
in
 
cotton
 
production.
 
This
 
progress
 
has
 
been
 
bolstered
 
by
 
the
 
expansion
 
of
 
cotton
 
ginning
 
industries,
 
particularly
 
in
 
areas
 
like
 
Jammikunta.
 
According
 
to
 
Mukka
 
Narayana,
 
a
 
seasoned
 
ginner
 
from
 
Jammikunta,
 
who
 
has
 
been
 
in
 
the
 
cotton
 
sector
 
since
 
1997,
 
the
 
launch
 
of
 
the
 
Technology
 
Mission
 
on
 
Cotton
 
in
 
2000
 
and
 
its
 
subsequent
 
popularization
 
in
 
2008,
 
mechanized
 
operations
 
have
 
become
 
more
 
prevalent,
 
signiﬁcantly
 
enhancing
 
processing
 
capacity
 
and
 
stabilizing
 
cotton
 
prices
 
over
 
time.
 
These
 
advancements
 
have
 
collectively
 
contributed
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
resilient
 
and
 
efﬁcient
 
cotton
 
supply
 
chain.
 
Financial
 
and
 
Operational
 
Constraints
 
on
 
Ginners
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
coordinator
 
Robin,
 
ginners
 
face
 
signiﬁcant
 
ﬁnancial
 
and
 
operational
 
constraints
 
that
 
impede
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
fully
 
comply
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
requirements
 
to
 
segregate
 
and
 
process
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
The
 
cost-intensive
 
nature
 
of
 
maintaining
 
separate
 
facilities
 
and
 
processes
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
combined
 
with
 
ﬂuctuating
 
cotton
 
prices,
 
presents
 
a
 
considerable
 
challenge
.
 
Ginners
 
have
 
highlighted
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
ﬁnancial
 
support
 
or
 
subsidies
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
or
 
other
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
help
 
mitigate
 
these
 
costs
.
 
Without
 
such
 
support,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
risk
 
that
 
ginners
 
may
 
deprioritize
 
the
 
separation
 
and
 
processing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
potentially
 
compromising
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
This
 
risk
 
is
 
however
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
mitigated
 
after
 
the
 
PU
 
Rescoping
 
which
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
ginners
 
to
 
bulk
 
the
 
cotton
 
from
 
a
 
geography
 
as
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
Marketing
 
and
 
Distribution
 
Complexities
 
Farmers
 
typically
 
market
 
their
 
cotton
 
through
 
two
 
primary
 
channels:
 
the
 
Government
 
Market
 
Yard,
 
which
 
operates
 
from
 
6
 
AM
 
to
 
9
 
AM,
 
or
 
by
 
directly
 
transporting
 
their
 
produce
 
to
 
preferred
 
ginning
 
mills.
 
In
 
both
 
scenarios,
 
the
 
transportation
 
cost
 
is
 
borne
 
by
 
the
 
farmer,
 
a
 
factor
 
that
 
sometimes
 
prompts
 
them
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
to
 
private
 
parties.
 
However,
 
transactions
 
with
 
private
 
parties
 
are
 
fraught
 
with
 
risks,
 
as
 
payments
 
are
 
often
 
made
 
on
 
credit,
 
with
 
only
 
partial
 
payments
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
sale.
 
This
 
arrangement
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
fraudulent
 
activities,
 
putting
 
the
 
farmers
 
at
 
a
 
disadvantage.
 
Despite
 
the
 
regulated
 
environment
 
of
 
the
 
government
 
marketplace,
 
where
 
transactions
 
involve
 
approved
 
agents,
 
and
 
the
 
direct
 
transport
 
to
 
ginners,
 
where
 
negotiations
 
occur
 
directly
 
in
 
between
 
the
 
farmer
 
and
 
the
 
ginner,
 
challenges
 
persist.
 
The
 
decentralized
 
and
 
dispersed
 
distribution
 
network
 
complicates
 
the
 
accumulation
 
of
 
sufﬁcient
 
quantities
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
within
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
timeframe.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
ginners
 
often
 
mix
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
which
 
undermines
 
the
 
traceability
 
and
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
Inﬂuence
 
of
 
Local
 
Market
 
Dynamics
 
Local
 
market
 
dynamics,
 
including
 
competition
 
from
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
buyers
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
government
 
policies
 
on
 
cotton
 
pricing,
 
play
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
shaping
 
the
 
decisions
 
of
 
both
 
farmers
 
and
 
ginners.
 
In
 
many
 
cases,
 
these
 
dynamics
 
lead
 
ginners
 
to
 
prioritize
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
due
 
to
 
better
 
immediate
 
returns.
 
This
 
prioritization
 
can
 
undermine
 
the
 
separation
 
and
 
traceability
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
affecting
 
the
 
overall
 
integrity
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.

emphasis
 
on
 
sustainable
 
farming
 
practices
 
has
 
helped
 
mitigate
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
impacts.
 
Farmers
 
have
 
been
 
equipped
 
with
 
techniques
 
to
 
better
 
manage
 
water
 
resources,
 
and
 
have
 
been
 
trained
 
on
 
border
 
croppings
 
and
 
inter
 
croppings,
 
leading
 
to
 
more
 
stable
 
yields
 
despite
 
adverse
 
weather
 
conditions.
 
However,
 
there
 
have
 
been
 
multiple
 
suggestions
 
from
 
farmers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
Field
 
Facilitators
 
for
 
an
 
improved
 
intervention
 
on
 
irrigation
 
facilities
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
providing
 
the
 
necessary
 
equipment
 
and
 
tools,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
guidance
 
for
 
water
 
management.
 
2.
 
Shift
 
Towards
 
Mechanized
 
Farming:
 
The
 
labor-intensive
 
nature
 
of
 
cotton
 
farming
 
has
 
driven
 
some
 
farmers
 
to
 
explore
 
alternatives,
 
such
 
as
 
paddy
 
cultivation.
 
With
 
paddy
 
cultivation
 
becoming
 
extremely
 
machine
 
driven,
 
the
 
farmers
 
get
 
ample
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
for
 
other
 
activities
 
as
 
well.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
hand,
 
cotton
 
being
 
primarily
 
labor
 
driven
 
increases
 
the
 
cost
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
effort.
 
3.
 
Disease
 
and
 
Pest
 
Infestations:
 
Pest-related
 
challenges,
 
such
 
as
 
locust
 
infestations,
 
have
 
been
 
a
 
signiﬁcant
 
concern.
 
However,
 
the
 
program’s
 
focus
 
on
 
integrated
 
pest
 
management
 
and
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
resistant
 
cotton
 
varieties
 
have
 
played
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
reducing
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
these
 
threats,
 
thereby
 
supporting
 
the
 
overall
 
increase
 
in
 
licensed
 
cotton
 
volumes.
 
The
 
3rd
 
party
 
veriﬁers
 
spoke
 
of
 
the
 
expected
 
improvement
 
in
 
this
 
aspect
 
with
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
Rescoping,
 
allowing
 
the
 
interventions
 
to
 
be
 
conducted
 
on
 
a
 
geographical
 
area
 
rather
 
than
 
on
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
alone.
 
 
 
Challenges
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Certiﬁcation
 
and
 
Compliance
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
has
 
established
 
connections
 
with
 
approximately
 
250-270
 
ginners
 
across
 
the
 
country,
 
who
 
are
 
certiﬁed
 
annually
 
after
 
participating
 
in
 
a
 
mandatory
 
one-day
 
training
 
session.
 
These
 
ginners
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
separate
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
from
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
during
 
processing.
 
However,
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
policy
 
of
 
allowing
 
farmers
 
the
 
ﬂexibility
 
to
 
choose
 
when
 
and
 
where
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
a
 
dispersed
 
distribution
 
network.
 
This
 
situation
 
creates
 
challenges
 
for
 
ginners,
 
who
 
struggle
 
to
 
accumulate
 
sufﬁcient
 
quantities
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
variant
 
at
 
any
 
given
 
time,
 
often
 
resulting
 
in
 
the
 
unintended
 
mixing
 
of
 
conventional
 
and
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
Additionally,
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
cotton
 
ends
 
up
 
with
 
ginners
 
who
 
are
 
not
 
registered
 
with
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
leading
 
to
 
gaps
 
in
 
traceability
 
and
 
difﬁculties
 
in
 
accurately
 
reporting
 
the
 
volumes
 
collected.
 
The
 
dispersed
 
nature
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supply
 
further
 
complicates
 
the
 
ginners'
 
ability
 
to
 
process
 
it
 
separately,
 
leading
 
to
 
logistical
 
constraints
 
and
 
a
 
lack
 
of
 
motivation
 
among
 
ginners
 
to
 
maintain
 
their
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
licenses.
 
Without
 
any
 
additional
 
incentives
 
or
 
support
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton,
 
many
 
ginners
 
express
 
reluctance
 
in
 
continuing
 
with
 
the
 
program,
 
further
 
jeopardizing
 
the
 
integrity
 
of
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supply
 
chain.
 
The
 
timing
 
of
 
cotton
 
sales
 
is
 
often
 
dictated
 
by
 
the
 
farmers'
 
immediate
 
ﬁnancial
 
needs
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
scientiﬁc
 
consideration
 
of
 
storage.
 
Farmers
 
usually
 
sell
 
their
 
cotton
 
according
 
to
 
convenience,
 
sometimes
 
storing
 
it
 
for
 
6-8
 
months,
 
which
 
can
 
degrade
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
cotton.
 
This
 
lack
 
of
 
55
 


 
adherence
 
to
 
scientiﬁc
 
storage
 
practices
 
further
 
complicates
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
and
 
reduces
 
the
 
overall
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
reaching
 
the
 
market.
 
Ginners
 
also
 
face
 
signiﬁcant
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
system
 
to
 
differentiate
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
from
 
conventional
 
cotton
.
 
Since
 
there
 
is
 
practically
 
no
 
major
 
outward
 
difference
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
varieties,
 
ginners
 
can
 
only
 
crosscheck
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
Farmers
 
List
 
as
 
an
 
evidence
 
for
 
the
 
produced
 
cotton
 
to
 
be
 
considered
 
as
 
Better
 
Cotton.
 
Practically
 
hence,
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmer
 
can
 
only
 
put
 
forth
 
his
 
certiﬁcation
 
as
 
a
 
negotiating
 
tool
 
with
 
the
 
ginner;
 
instances
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
farmers
 
demanding
 
high
 
price
 
have
 
also
 
been
 
reported
 
from
 
the
 
ginners
 
which
 
the
 
ginner
 
is
 
reluctant
 
to
 
pay.
 
 
Added
 
to
 
these,
 
some
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
growers
 
remain
 
resistant
 
to
 
adopting
 
Better
 
Cotton’s
 
recommended
 
practices.
 
Many
 
of
 
these
 
growers
 
do
 
not
 
perceive
 
signiﬁcant
 
value
 
in
 
altering
 
their
 
established
 
methods
 
which
 
they
 
have
 
been
 
practicing
 
for
 
years,
 
speciﬁcally
 
as
 
they
 
already
 
achieve
 
satisfactory
 
quality
 
and
 
yields
 
with
 
their
 
current
 
practices.
 
This
 
resistance
 
to
 
change
 
poses
 
additional
 
challenges
 
in
 
expanding
 
the
 
uptake
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
within
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.

manages
 
audits,
 
reviews
 
reports,
 
and
 
builds
 
capacity,
 
particularly
 
within
 
the
 
ginning
 
segment.
 
This
 
role
 
involves
 
overseeing
 
capacity-building
 
programs
 
for
 
ginners,
 
ensuring
 
compliance
 
with
 
CoC
 
standards
 
throughout
 
the
 
supply
 
chain,
 
from
 
ginners
 
to
 
end
 
manufacturers.
 
These
 
programs
 
are
 
typically
 
held
 
in
 
August
 
and
 
September.
 
Monitoring
 
and
 
audits
 
are
 
central
 
to
 
the
 
role,
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
addressing
 
ginners’
 
queries
 
and
 
providing
 
technical
 
assistance
 
on
 
the
 
Better
 
56
 


 
Cotton
 
platform.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
process
 
includes
 
onboarding
 
ginners
 
located
 
within
 
a
 
50
 
to
 
100
 
km
 
radius
 
of
 
PUs
 
to
 
ensure
 
proximity
 
to
 
farmers.
 
Each
 
ginner
 
is
 
assigned
 
a
 
unique
 
code,
 
and
 
participation
 
is
 
free.
 
However,
 
the
 
credibility
 
of
 
the
 
system
 
is
 
challenged
 
by
 
the
 
potential
 
mixing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
during
 
transportation
 
and
 
processing.
 
To
 
mitigate
 
this,
 
regular
 
visits
 
to
 
ginners
 
are
 
conducted
 
during
 
the
 
active
 
season
 
from
 
September
 
to
 
March
 
to
 
enforce
 
segregation
 
standards.
 
 
Traceability
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
the
 
role,
 
requiring
 
ginners
 
to
 
maintain
 
detailed
 
records
 
at
 
the
 
farmer
 
level,
 
including
 
transportation
 
methods,
 
quantities
 
purchased,
 
and
 
the
 
source
 
of
 
the
 
cotton—whether
 
directly
 
from
 
farmers
 
or
 
through
 
middlemen.
 
Supporting
 
documents,
 
such
 
as
 
purchase
 
slips,
 
quantity
 
slips,
 
and
 
transportation
 
records,
 
must
 
be
 
meticulously
 
kept.
 
A
 
key
 
challenge
 
arises
 
when
 
ginners
 
cannot
 
dispatch
 
separate
 
vehicles
 
for
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton,
 
heightening
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
mixing.
 
To
 
address
 
this,
 
segregation
 
practices
 
are
 
emphasized
 
during
 
training
 
sessions,
 
and
 
vehicle
 
records
 
are
 
scrutinized
 
during
 
assessments
 
to
 
mitigate
 
this
 
risk.
 
The
 
supply
 
chain
 
is
 
complex,
 
involving
 
multiple
 
stages
 
from
 
ginners
 
to
 
traders,
 
spinners,
 
yarn
 
producers,
 
fabric
 
manufacturers,
 
and
 
ﬁnally,
 
brands.
 
The
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
platform
 
records
 
the
 
quantity
 
of
 
cotton
 
purchased
 
but
 
does
 
not
 
track
 
pricing,
 
which
 
is
 
negotiated
 
between
 
buyers
 
and
 
sellers.
 
Once
 
cotton
 
is
 
recorded
 
on
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
platform,
 
it
 
enters
 
the
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
supply
 
chain,
 
though
 
not
 
all
 
Better
 
Cotton-produced
 
cotton
 
may
 
end
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
if
 
sold
 
elsewhere,
 
posing
 
a
 
challenge
 
to
 
system
 
credibility.
 
Gaps
 
between
 
ginners
 
and
 
farmers,
 
especially
 
in
 
regions
 
like
 
Tamil
 
Nadu,
 
where
 
ginners
 
have
 
limited
 
information
 
about
 
farmers,
 
further
 
complicate
 
credibility.
 
The
 
uptake
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
often
 
falls
 
short
 
of
 
the
 
expected
 
AAV
 
for
 
each
 
PU,
 
leading
 
to
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
reported
 
volumes.
 
While
 
ginners
 
maintain
 
physical
 
traceability,
 
limitations
 
arise
 
as
 
cotton
 
moves
 
further
 
along
 
the
 
supply
 
chain.
 
The
 
system
 
employs
 
two
 
models
 
for
 
CoC:
 
physical
 
traceability
 
and
 
mass
 
balance
 
(MB).
 
The
 
physical
 
model
 
requires
 
strict
 
separation
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
non-Better
 
Cotton
 
at
 
every
 
stage,
 
though
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
mixing
 
remains.
 
The
 
MB
 
model
 
is
 
more
 
ﬂexible,
 
using
 
BCCUs
 
(Better
 
Cotton
 
claim
 
units)
 
to
 
represent
 
the
 
quantity
 
of
 
lint
 
cotton
 
sold.
 
However,
 
audits
 
are
 
conducted
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
these
 
points
 
are
 
only
 
transferred
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
an
 
actual
 
physical
 
transaction,
 
preserving
 
the
 
system’s
 
credibility.
 
Ginners’
 
Perspectives
 
and
 
Future
 
Outlook
 
Ginners
 
have
 
expressed
 
optimism
 
about
 
the
 
potential
 
beneﬁts
 
of
 
a
 
geographic
 
rescoping
 
approach,
 
which
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
facilitate
 
better
 
collectivization
 
and
 
easier
 
categorization
 
of
 
cotton
 
varieties.
 
Such
 
a
 
system
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
by
 
doing
 
away
 
with
 
having
 
to
 
process
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
and
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
separately,
 
thus
 
addressing
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
major
 
challenges
 
faced
 
by
 
ginners
 
at
 
present.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
case
 
for
 
adopting
 
a
 
more
 
scientiﬁc
 
approach
 
to
 
post-harvest
 
management.
 
Given
 
that
 
farmers
 
often
 
sell
 
their
 
produce
 
based
 
on
 
convenience
 
rather
 
than
 
scientiﬁc
 
storage
 
timings,
 
promoting
 
better
 
storage
 
practices
 
and
 
speciﬁc
 
duration
 
for
 
sales
 
could
 
signiﬁcantly
 
improve
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
cotton
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
efﬁciency
 
of
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
.
 
Ginners
 
suggest
 
that
 
post-harvest
 
marketing
 
of
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
should
 
be
 
collectivized,
 
with
 
assistance
 
from
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
to
 
enhance
 
both
 
the
 
farmers'
 
negotiating
 
power
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
convenience
 
for
 
ginners
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
Additionally,
 
extending
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
incentives
 
to
 
non-program
 
farmers
 
could
 
motivate
 
more
 
growers
 
to
 
gradually
 
adopt
 
Better
 
Cotton
 
practices,
 
thereby
 
strengthening
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
and
 
improving
 
57
 


 
traceability.
 
This
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
better
 
addressed
 
with
 
the
 
rescoping
 
approach
 
owing
 
to
 
the
 
new
 
approach’
 
focus
 
on
 
expanding
 
its
 
reach
 
to
 
all
 
farmers
 
within
 
a
 
geography.

Limitations
 
Certain
 
limitations
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
of
 
the
 
PU
 
rescoping
 
intervention
 
are
 
given
 
below
 
-
 
 
a)
 
While
 
care
 
has
 
been
 
taken
 
to
 
clearly
 
outline
 
and
 
quantify
 
wherever
 
possible
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
stakeholders,
 
the
 
contextual
 
and
 
subjective
 
nature
 
of
 
ﬁndings
 
associated
 
with
 
qualitative
 
outcomes
 
could
 
limit
 
the
 
effective
 
comparison
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
ﬁndings
 
with
 
the
 
endline.
 
 
b)
 
Perspectives
 
of
 
women
 
farmers
 
(though
 
obtained
 
qualitatively)
 
could
 
not
 
be
 
gathered
 
from
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
extremely
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
locate
 
women
 
program
 
farmers,
 
given
 
the
 
low
 
reach
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
towards
 
women
 
farmers
 
at
 
present.
 
 
c)
 
Given
 
the
 
context-speciﬁc
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
intervention,
 
it
 
could
 
prove
 
challenging
 
to
 
prove
 
the
 
external
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
necessary
 
for
 
scaling
 
of
 
the

Baseline Evaluation of Better Cotton: 
Producer Unit Rescoping Pilot 
Key Findings 
Catalyst Management Services 
Cotton Farms in Chityalapally, Telangana  

Efforts in Data Collection Program Effectiveness 
Better Cotton Harvest Supply Chain Credibility ● Field staff spend 30-45% of time on data 
collection, 20-30% on administration, and 
25-50% on farmer capacity-building. 
● Manual data collection and veriﬁcation are 
time-consuming, prompting a need for 
efﬁcient systems to allow more focus on 
farmer engagement. ● Only 2-3% of program farmers are women, 
with them struggling to balance household 
chores with farming responsibilities. 
● There is strong interest from female 
co-farmers  and non-program farmers, 
indicating the need for increased 
capacity-building efforts for women, 
especially in newer PUs. ● Older PUs (INTL01/02) show higher 
adoption of practices and satisfaction 
with training, while newer PUs (INTL 23) 
lag due to previous negative 
experiences. 
● Major reasons for continued program 
participation include learning new 
topics, facilitator support, and exposure 
visits. 
● Low procurement volumes make it challenging to 
segregate Better Cotton from conventional cotton, 
risking mixing during transportation and processing. 
● Regular visits to ginners during peak season help 
enforce segregation standards. Women Participation 
● Are under production, cotton volumes harvested and 
licensed showing overall positive trends over the years. 
● On average, volume of licensed cotton has increased by 
8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, 02 and 23 from 
2021 to 2023 respectively. 
Key Findings of baseline evaluation 

Background of PURE Project  
3 The ' Producer Unit Rescoping' (PURE) pilot  aims to test a new, geographic 
approach  to implementing the Better Cotton Standard System to improve 
efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability  of the program by supporting more 
holistic, community-based approaches by rescoping 3PUs into 1 larger PU in 
Karimnagar and Warangal districts of T elangana .
Better Cotton’s Producer Unit rescoping intervention has been designed 
with the 3-fold aim of 
(i) Enhancing capacity strengthening through community-based approaches 
focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender 
equality, and sustainable livelihoods. 
(ii) Improving efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, 
implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit 
scale. 
(iii) Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need 
for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms.

with Rescoping 
Ginners are optimistic that geographic 
rescoping will improve the efﬁciency of 
segregation and help them process 
Better Cotton more effectively 
Farmers sell cotton to private parties on 
credit in a decentralized distribution 
network, complicating the accumulation of 
sufﬁcient Better Cotton. 
Increase in demand of farmers for 
higher market rates for Better 
Cotton. Market Complexities 
Credibility Issues 
Some Better Cotton ends up with non-registered 
ginners, leading to gaps in reporting and traceability. 
Suggestions for

grouping of cotton as per 
quality. KPI 7 - Uptake and credibility issues within the Supply Chain . 


Recommendations to Program Design 
22 Organize farmer 
meetings speciﬁcally for 
women Expand reach of 
demonstrations. Use more audiovisual tools Simplify data collection 
for PUMs to free up time 
for Capacity 
Strengthening activities • For FFs, PUMs and PC  
• Male and Female Program farmers, Lead farmers, Non-program and Co-farmers 
Farmers demand 
high-quality seeds, PPE 
kits, storage bags Season-wise trainings at a 
convenient time Organize women-speciﬁc 
farmer meetings at 
convenient timings 


Recommendations to Program Design 
23 Broader chunk of 
information to be shared 
before assessments • Third party veriﬁers, Assurance coordinator  • MEL coordinator 
Need to exercise caution 
in sampling of lead 
farmers 
• Better Cotton - registered ginner  
Aggregation and sale of Better 
Cotton in large quantities by the 
farmers will help in ensuring 
separate processing and higher 
uptake of Better Cotton • Evaluation T eam  
Recommend using RCEEIS 
evaluation criteria at the 
endline to gauge attainment 
of project outcomes &amp; 
strategies to scale up

Baseline Evaluation of Better Cotton: 
Producer Unit Rescoping Pilot 
Key Findings 
Catalyst Management Services 
Cotton Farms in Chityalapally, Telangana  

Efforts in Data Collection Program Effectiveness 
Better Cotton Harvest Supply Chain Credibility ● Field staff spend 30-45% of time on data 
collection, 20-30% on administration, and 
25-50% on farmer capacity-building. 
● Manual data collection and veriﬁcation are 
time-consuming, prompting a need for 
efﬁcient systems to allow more focus on 
farmer engagement. ● Only 2-3% of program farmers are women, 
with them struggling to balance household 
chores with farming responsibilities. 
● There is strong interest from female 
co-farmers  and non-program farmers, 
indicating the need for increased 
capacity-building efforts for women, 
especially in newer PUs. ● Older PUs (INTL01/02) show higher 
adoption of practices and satisfaction 
with training, while newer PUs (INTL 23) 
lag due to previous negative 
experiences. 
● Major reasons for continued program 
participation include learning new 
topics, facilitator support, and exposure 
visits. 
● Low procurement volumes make it challenging to 
segregate Better Cotton from conventional cotton, 
risking mixing during transportation and processing. 
● Regular visits to ginners during peak season help 
enforce segregation standards. Women Participation 
● Are under production, cotton volumes harvested and 
licensed showing overall positive trends over the years. 
● On average, volume of licensed cotton has increased by 
8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, 02 and 23 from 
2021 to 2023 respectively. 
Key Findings of baseline evaluation 

Background of PURE Project  
3 The ' Producer Unit Rescoping' (PURE) pilot  aims to test a new, geographic 
approach  to implementing the Better Cotton Standard System to improve 
efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability  of the program by supporting more 
holistic, community-based approaches by rescoping 3PUs into 1 larger PU in 
Karimnagar and Warangal districts of T elangana .
Better Cotton’s Producer Unit rescoping intervention has been designed 
with the 3-fold aim of 
(i) Enhancing capacity strengthening through community-based approaches 
focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender 
equality, and sustainable livelihoods. 
(ii) Improving efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, 
implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit 
scale. 
(iii) Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need 
for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms.

● FFB not maintained/updated by the farmers regularly 
● Female farmers rarely attend meetings due to household 
chores &amp; decision making  authority lies majorly with the 
male member. 
● Would be helpful if duration of meetings is reduced to 45 
minutes. 
● Farmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training 
tools and better safety materials. KPI 6 - Change in number of farmers reached through

Year-wise area under licensed Better Cotton 
production (Ha) by PU 
Y ear-wise cotton harvested (MT) by PU 
On average, from 2021 to 2023, the area under cotton production has increased by 13.5% for INTL01, 7.5% for INTL02 and 
16.5% for INTL23 and cotton production has increased by 6.65%, 8.15% and 14.58% for INTL01, 02 and 23 respectively. 

 On average, the volume of licensed cotton has increased by 8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23 from 2021 
to 2023 respectively. Of the volumes licensed in 2021-22, about 86%, 75% and 97% from INTL01, 02 and 23 was actually absorbed 
in the supply chain.  No Better Cotton could be pushed into the supply chain in the years 2022-23 and 2023-24 as the program 
team has been encountering challenges with ginner registrations and had to deal with high administrative workloads for uploading 
uptake data in their dedicated portal. KPI 3 - Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing

● Assurance coordinator 
indicates high level of 
conﬁdence in the assurance 
system. 
● Robust sampling methods, 
random LG selection, and 
consistent data triangulation Conﬁdence 
● Extensive data 
veriﬁcation and 
assessments across 
PUs once every 3 years 
● Conduct licensing 
audits and surveillance 
audits to assess 
compliance. 
Comprehensive 
● Around 60% of the assessments are 
done by 3PVs, ensuring objectivity and 
independence 
● 3PVs perform risk proﬁling before 
assessments, interviewing independent 
stakeholders to identify potential issues 3 PV ● Logistical challenges in reaching 
remote locations for assessments. 
● Time constraints due to a short 
three-day assessment period. 
● Issues with disqualiﬁed LGs 
rebranding themselves, 
complicating the veriﬁcation 
process. Challenges 
KPI 4 -  Change in level of conﬁdence in the assurance results 


KPI 5 -  Change in level of conﬁdence in MEL data 
● Data on farmer lists/ seasonal 
estimates, adoption data, RIR, soil 
health, water resources, PRA, 
disadvantaged individuals and 
degraded lands collected from ﬁeld. Data collection on ﬁeld 
● Reach, RIR, training data and 
contextual information required for 
tracking progress of PUs. 
● Data reported within deadlines 
however, seeking clariﬁcations 
from ﬁeld may be time-consuming. Reporting requirements of 
Better Cotton ● MEL coordinator indicates 
medium to high level of 
conﬁdence in MEL processes. 
● APUM checks 40% to 50% of 
data, the PUM checks 10%, 
and the project coordinator 
veriﬁes 3 to 5% data. Conﬁdence 
● Rectifying data collection, entry errors 
and issues with sampling of large 
farmers. 
● Reporting of same yield by many 
farmers, issues with units of 
conversion raises concerns of 
accuracy. Challenges 

 
Financial and Operational 
Constraints 
Ginners face ﬁnancial and operational 
difﬁculties in segregating Better Cotton from 
conventional cotton Positive Outlook 
with Rescoping 
Ginners are optimistic that geographic 
rescoping will improve the efﬁciency of 
segregation and help them process 
Better Cotton more effectively 
Farmers sell cotton to private parties on 
credit in a decentralized distribution 
network, complicating the accumulation of 
sufﬁcient Better Cotton. 
Increase in demand of farmers for 
higher market rates for Better 
Cotton. Market Complexities 
Credibility Issues 
Some Better Cotton ends up with non-registered 
ginners, leading to gaps in reporting and traceability. 
Suggestions for 
Improvement 
Better collectivization and 
grouping of cotton as per 
quality. KPI 7 - Uptake and credibility issues within the Supply Chain . 


Recommendations to Program Design 
22 Organize farmer 
meetings speciﬁcally for 
women Expand reach of 
demonstrations. Use more audiovisual tools Simplify data collection 
for PUMs to free up time 
for Capacity 
Strengthening activities • For FFs, PUMs and PC  
• Male and Female Program farmers, Lead farmers, Non-program and Co-farmers 
Farmers demand 
high-quality seeds, PPE 
kits, storage bags Season-wise trainings at a 
convenient time Organize women-speciﬁc 
farmer meetings at 
convenient timings 


Recommendations to Program Design 
23 Broader chunk of 
information to be shared 
before assessments • Third party veriﬁers, Assurance coordinator  • MEL coordinator 
Need to exercise caution 
in sampling of lead 
farmers 
• Better Cotton - registered ginner  
Aggregation and sale of Better 
Cotton in large quantities by the 
farmers will help in ensuring 
separate processing and higher 
uptake of Better Cotton • Evaluation T eam  
Recommend using RCEEIS 
evaluation criteria at the 
endline to gauge attainment 
of project outcomes &amp; 
strategies to scale up

The survey worksheet
This worksheet specifies all of the groups, questions, and other fields in your survey form, each in its own row. Aside from overall settings and lists of multiple-choice options, everything about your survey form is specified in this worksheet.
Learn more about form definitions and field types
type	name	label	label:languagename	hint	hint:languagename	default	appearance	constraint	constraint message	constraint message:languagename	relevance	disabled	required	required message	required message:languagename	read only	calculation	repeat_count	media:image	media:audio	media:video	media:image:languagename	media:audio:languagename	media:video:languagename	choice_filter	note	response_note	publishable	minimum_seconds
This column specifies the type of the field or group. It has to follow a pre-specified format, and Excel's conditional formatting has been used to auto-highlight rows that appear to have a valid type column -- so, if you are using Excel and your row is not automatically highlighted, re-check that you have entered the type properly. 

See below for an exhaustive list of brief examples.	This column specifies the name of the field or group. Field names must be unique, and they cannot include any spaces or punctuation. 

Example: age	For those field types that present a user interface, this column is where you put the primary text for the question or field. You can include line-breaks in your label text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac.	Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language.

View the help topic below for more details.	Text in this column, if any, will appear italicized beneath the field's label. You can include line-breaks in your hint text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac.	Any hint:languagename column (e.g., hint:tamil) may be added in order to provide hints in an alternative language.

View the help topic below for more details.	If you want to default the user's entry or selection for a given field, you can specify a number or some text in this column. 

Alternatively, you can specify an expression for dynamically calculating the field's default entry or selection, in the &quot;calculation&quot; column. View the help topic below for more details.

View the help topic below for more details.	For field types that allow multiple appearances, you can specify the appearance style in this column (e.g., quick or minimal for select_one fields). 

See the individual examples below.	Enter an expression into this column to validate entered or selected values. The user will only be allowed to proceed to the next question when the expression evaluates to true. Use the constraint builder to build new constraint expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) 

Example: . &lt; 130

View the help topic below for more details.	If the user tries to move forward but the constraint expression is false, a generic &quot;That entry is invalid&quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column.

View the help topic below for more details.	Any constraint message:languagename column (e.g., constraint message:tamil) may be added in order to provide constraint messages in an alternative language.	Enter an expression into this column to control when a field or group displays to the user (i.e., to control when it is &quot;relevant&quot;). The field or group will only show up to users when the expression in this column evaluates to true; otherwise, it will remain hidden. Use the relevance builder to build new relevance expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) 

Example: ${age} &lt; 18

View the help topic below for more details.	Enter yes into this column to temporarily disable a field. (Rarely used.)

View the help topic below for more details.	Enter yes into this column to require that users enter or select a value before continuing.

View the help topic below for more details.	If the user tries to move forward without entering or selecting a value for a required field, a generic &quot;Sorry, this response is required&quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column.

View the help topic below for more details.	Any required message:languagename column (e.g., required message:tamil) may be added in order to provide required messages in an alternative language.	Enter yes into this column to make it read-only (a user can see the field, but cannot enter or select a value). (Rarely used, because note fields, which are by nature read-only, are automatically read-only regardless of what is specified here.)	This column specifies the expression to use for a calculate field, or the expression to use for calculating the default entry or selection for a visible form field. Use the calculation builder to build new calculation expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.)

View the help topic below for more details.	For a begin repeat row, this column can specify the number of times to repeat the group of questions. (Can be a fixed count like 3 or a reference to an earlier field like ${numhh_members}.)

View the help topic below for more details.	To include an image to display for a field (in addition to or in lieu of its label), its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. 

Example: paddy.png

View the help topic below for more details.	To include a sound clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. 

Example: explanation.3gpp

View the help topic below for more details.	To include a video clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. 

Example: demonstration.mp4

View the help topic below for more details.	Any media:image:languagename column (e.g., media:image:tamil) may be added in order to provide images for an alternative language.

View the help topic below for more details.	Any media:audio:languagename column (e.g., media:audio:tamil) may be added in order to provide audio clips for an alternative language.

View the help topic below for more details.	Any media:video:languagename column (e.g., media:video:tamil) may be added in order to provide video clips for an alternative language.

View the help topic below for more details.	When filtering lists of multiple-choice options, this column specifies, for each field, which prior field should be used when filtering the list of options. 

Example: filter=${survey_region}

View the help topic below for more details.	This column can specify an optional note to appear with the field in printable versions of the survey form, in order to explain when groups or fields will appear (i.e., when they are relevant), what restrictions there are on user entries (i.e., what constraints apply), etc.	This column can specify optional text or symbols to appear in the response area to the right of questions in printable versions of the survey form. For a text field, for example, you might put something like |___|___| if you are looking for two letters or numbers; or, for a checkbox, you might put a hollow square like □ (this is a special HTML character: enter &quot;&amp;#9633;&quot;, without quotes, into this column); finally, for a radio button, you might simply enter a capital O.	Enter yes into this column to indicate that a field in an encrypted form should be left unencrypted so that it can be published to one or more datasets. Use only for non-sensitive fields that can be left unencrypted without compromising data security. (This field is ignored for unencrypted forms.)

View the help topic below for more details.	Enter a number of seconds that represents the minimum time enumerators should spend the first time they view the field. This represents a &quot;speed limit&quot; that can be enforced by SurveyCTO Collect for Android (with the Enforce minimum times for fields option within Collect's Admin Settings); alternatively, you can track violations with the following field types: &quot;speed violations count&quot;, &quot;speed violations list&quot;, and &quot;speed violations audit&quot; (see examples for these field types below).

The choices worksheet
This worksheet is for the configuration of multiple-choice response options. These are stored in choice lists which are used with select_one and select_multiple type fields.
Read about the select_one field type for more information
Read about the select_multiple field type for more information
Read about dynamically loading choice lists from external pre-loaded data
list_name	value	label	label:languagename	image	image:languagename	filter
This column specifies the name of a multiple-choice question type (without any spaces or punctuation). A given list of options will involve multiple rows, each with the same list_name. Example: yesno	This column specifies the internal value stored for a given choice. (It should really be called &quot;value&quot; rather than &quot;name&quot;.) Example: 1

If dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load option values.	This column specifies the label to use for a given choice, in the form's default language. Example: Yes

If dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name -- or comma-separated list of column names -- from which to load option labels for the default language.	Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language.

View the help topic below for more details.	To include an image to display for an option, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. Example: paddy.png

If dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load image filenames.

View the help topic below for more details.	Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide images in an alternative language.	To filter the list of options displayed, a filter value can be specified here, along with a filter expression in the choice_filter column of the survey worksheet. For example, you might have filter values like LAC and a choice_filter like filter=${survey_region}. For more details, see the following help topic: How can I filter the list of multiple-choice options presented to users?

--- Sheet: help-settings ---
The settings worksheet
This worksheet contains overall settings for your form, all specified in the second row of the worksheet. When you download a form template from your SurveyCTO server, these settings will be pre-filled for you.
form_title	form_id	version	public_key	submission_url	default_language
This is the title of your form. Enumerators will use the title to tell different forms apart. You will be able to revise the title of the form through subsequent form updates.

If you begin this title with TEST - (as in &quot;TEST - Household listing survey&quot;), it will not appear by default to users. View the help topic below for more details.	This is the unique ID that will identify the form. The form ID must not contain spaces and must remain fixed for the life of the form. The form ID must also begin with a letter, and it can only include letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (no other punctuation or special characters).

Example: hhlisting_round1	This is the version number of the form, which you must increase each time you modify an existing form. If you started with a form template or with one of the sample forms, then this is automatic: the version is set to a formula that automatically increments every minute. (Otherwise, you need to increment the version number yourself, taking care to keep the number of digits fixed; the version has to be a single whole number, and its number of digits has to stay the same from one version to the next. The convention is to always use a ten-digit number that represents the current date and time, e.g., 1401130917 for 9:17AM on January 13, 2014. Alternatively, you can use 10-digit numbers like 0000000001 and 0000000024 or 3-digit numbers like 001 and 024.)
