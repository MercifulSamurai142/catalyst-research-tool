Steps in applying Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) and obtaining the sample 
list
 
1. Calculate the sample size for each strata.  
Strata: Panchkula; Yamunanagar; Gurugram; Sample size = 30 
2. Separate population data into strata. The following steps will have to be applied for each strata.  

3. List the primary sampling units (Schools) and their population sizes (Number of schools). Each School 
has
 
its
 
own
 
Cluster
 
Population
 
Size.
 
 
Primary sampling units (Schools): Panchkula; Yamuna nagar; Gurugram 
Population Size (Total Number of Schools): Panchkula = 113; Yamuna Nagar = 276; Gurugram = 183 
4. Calculate the cumulative sum of the population sizes. The Total Population will be the cumulative sum 
of
 
the
 
enrollment.
 
 
Total Population Size (Cumulative number of enrollment): Panchkula = 18345; Yamuna Nagar = 26600; 
Gurugram
 
=
 
40061
 
 
5. Determine the Number of Clusters that will be sampled.  
Number of clusters = 30 
6. Determine the Number of Individuals to be sampled from each school. In order to ensure that all 
individuals
 
in
 
the
 
population
 
have
 
the
 
same
 
probability
 
of
 
selection
 
irrespective
 
of
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
their
 
cluster,
 
the
 
same
 
number
 
of
 
individuals
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
sampled
 
from
 
each
 
school.
 
 
Number of Individuals to be sampled from each school = 40 
7. Divide the total population by the number of clusters to be sampled, to get the Sampling Interval (SI).  
Sampling Interval (SI): Panchkula = 18345/30; Yamuna Nagar = 26600/30; Gurugram = 40061/30 
8. Choose a random number between 1 and the SI. This is the Random Start (RS). The first cluster to be 
sampled
 
contains
 
this
 
cumulative
 
population.
 
[Excel
 
command
 
=rand()*SI]
 
 
Random Start (RS): Panchkula = 429; Yamuna Nagar = 570; Gurugram = 616

necessary
 
skills
 
to

holistic
 
development
 
of
 
adolescents,
 
enhancing
 
their
 
resilience,
 
self-efﬁcacy,
 
and
 
agency
 
skills.
 
Recognizing
 
the
 
pressing
 
need
 
for
 
such
 
a
 
program,

signiﬁcant
 
portion
 
of
 
Indian
 
adolescents
 
lack
 
essential
 
life
 
skills
 
required
 
for
 
employment
 
or
 
managing
 
daily
 
life
 
activities.
 
The
 
initiative
 
not
 
only
 
supports
 
adolescents
 
in
 
continuing
 
their
 
education
 
and
 
setting
 
career
 
goals
 
but
 
also
 
aligns
 
with
 
the
 
new
 
National
 
Education
 
Policy
 
commitments.

from
 
this
 
perspective
 
are
 
essentially
 
those
 
abilities
 
which
 
help
 
to

in
 
young

revolves
 
around
 
instructing
 
individuals
 
in
 
essential
 
skills
 
that
 
are
 
applicable
 
to
 
their
 
everyday
 
lives.
 
Life
 
skills,
 
when
 
taught
 
as
 
generic
 
skills
 
for
 
life,
 
are
 
taught
 
in
 
the

Life

an

and

(Desai,

These
 
skills
 
play
 
a
 
vital
 
role
 
in
 
helping
 
young
 
individuals
 
effectively
 
navigate
 
and

they
 
encounter
 
while
 
striving
 
to

of

The
 
purpose
 
of
 
life

is
 
to
 
facilitate
 
the

of
 
skills
 
that
 
have
 
a
 
direct
 
impact
 
on
 
health
 
and
 
behaviour
 
within
 
the
 
social
 
environment.
 
Today's
 
Indian
 
adolescents
 
have
 
more
 
information
 
and
 
cultural
 
alternatives
 
than
 
before,
 
but
 
economic
 
dependence
 
on
 
parents
 
limits
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
make
 
choices.
 
To
 
succeed
 
globally
 
and
 
become
 
independent
 
adults,
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
psychosocial
 
competencies
 
through
 
life
 
skills
 
training.
 
This
 
training
 
equips
 
them
 
with
 
the
 
necessary
 
skills
 
to
 
navigate
 
a
 
competitive
 
and
 
rapidly
 
changing
 
world
 
(Narasimha

India,
 
with
 
its
 
vast
 
population,
 
faces
 
numerous
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
education
 
and
 
skill
 
development
 
sector,
 
particularly
 
for
 
adolescents.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
observed
 
that
 
while
 
nearly
 
all
 
children
 
are
 
enrolled
 
in
 
primary
 
schools,
 
the
 
transition
 
to
 
higher
 
education
 
remains
 
low,
 
with
 
only
 
33%
 
progressing
 
to
 
Grade
 
11
 
and
 
a
 
mere
 
10%
 
pursuing
 
higher
 
education.
 
Furthermore,
 
workforce
 
participation
 
rates
 
are
 
declining
 
in
 
rural
 
areas,
 
and
 
gender
 
disparities
 
in
 
salaried
 
employment
 
persist,
 
posing
 
signiﬁcant
 
barriers
 
to
 
economic
 
empowerment
 
and
 
social
 
progress.
 
Recognizing
 
the
 
critical
 
need
 
to
 
address
 
these
 
challenges,
 
the
 
Magic
 
Bus
 
India
 
Foundation
 
(MBIF)
 
has
 
initiated
 
the
 
&quot;Government
 
Partnership
 
Programme
 
in
 
Haryana.&quot;
 
This
 
program
 
aims
 
to
 
provide
 
life
 
skills
 
education
 
to
 
adolescents
 
from
 
underserved
 
backgrounds,
 
empowering
 
them
 
with
 
the
 
necessary
 
tools
 
to
 
navigate
 
their
 
journey
 
from
 
childhood
 
to
 
livelihood.
 
By
 
focusing
 
on
 
skill
 
development
 
and
 
fostering
 
a
 
supportive
 
environment,
 
the
 
program
 
seeks
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
required
 
skills
 
and
 
available
 
opportunities,
 
ultimately
 
enabling
 
adolescents
 
to
 
make
 
informed
 
decisions
 
about
 
their
 
futures.
 
The
 
Government
 
Partnership
 
Programme
 
in
 
Haryana
 
is
 
being
 
implemented
 
in
 
collaboration
 
with
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Education,
 
Haryana,
 
and
 
Samagra
 
Governance.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
three
 
districts:
 
Gurugram,
 
Panchkula,
 
and
 
Yamuna
 
Nagar.
 
The
 
program
 
targets
 
an
 
outreach
 
of
 
80,009
 
adolescents
 
and
 
1,358
 
teachers
 
across
 
679
 
schools
 
in
 
the
 
academic
 
year
 
2023-24.
 
The
 
curriculum
 
will
 
be
 
delivered
 
to
 
students
 
in
 
Classes
 
6
 
to
 
8
 
through
 
a
 
cohort-based
 
approach,
 
with
 
a
 
transition
 
to
 
higher
 
grades
 
in
 
subsequent
 
years.
 
 
The
 
program
 
adopts
 
an
 
innovative
 
teacher-led
 
model,
 
wherein
 
teachers
 
are
 
trained
 
to
 
deliver
 
life
 
skills
 
education
 
sessions
 
to
 
students.
 
Each
 
academic
 
year,
 
students
 
will
 
receive
 
48
 
hours
 
of
 
activity-based
 
experiential
 
learning
 
sessions,
 
focusing
 
on
 
knowledge,
 
skill,
 
and
 
attitude
 
development.
 
The
 
sessions
 
will
 
be
 
designed
 
to
 
encourage
 
student
 
participation,
 
reﬂection,
 
and
 
behaviour
 
change.
 
Magic

implementation
 
of
 
the

make
 
better
 
learners.
 
With
 
this
 
aim
 
in
 
mind,
 
the
 
Haryana
 
Education
 
Department
 
is
 
currently
 
developing
 
a
 
framework
 
to
 
introduce
 
activity-based
 
learning
 
in
 
government
 
schools.
 
Additionally,
 
Saturdays
 
are
 
now
 
designated
 
solely
 
for
 
extra-curricular
 
activities
 
in
 
schools
 
to
 
enhance
 
students'
 
skills.
 
 
A
 
change
 
in
 
pedagogy
 
is
 
being
 
implemented,
 
starting
 
with
 
the
 
primary
 
classes.
 
Instead
 
of
 
rote
 
learning,
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
activities
 
are
 
being
 
introduced.
 
Experts
 
from
 
the
 
ﬁelds
 
of
 
science
 
and
 
mathematics
 
are
 
called
 
upon
 
to
 
interact
 
with
 
students
 
and
 
assist
 
them
 
in
 
understanding
 
the
 
fundamental
 
concepts

of
 
Education
 
Haryana,
 
2016)
 
 
 
Skill
 
Passbook
 
Initiative
 
by
 
Haryana
 
Govt.
 
 
The
 
provision
 
of
 
Skill
 
Passbooks
 
and
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
Catch-up
 
Program
 
are
 
ongoing
 
for
 
the
 
current
 
academic
 
year.
 
During
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
week,
 
the
 
process
 
begins
 
with
 
a
 
skill
 
review
 
and
 
the
 
identiﬁcation
 
of
 
students.
 
Teachers
 
in
 
each
 
class
 
review
 
their
 
students'
 
skill
 
passbooks
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
accurately
 
reﬂect
 
the
 
students'
 
competency
 
levels
 
in
 
reading,
 
writing
 
in
 
languages,
 
and
 
numeracy
 
skills
 
from
 
the
 
previous
 
year.
 
 
Students
 
who
 
require
 
assistance
 
with
 
skill
 
enhancement
 
are
 
identiﬁed,
 
along
 
with
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
already
 
achieved
 
proﬁciency.
 
The
 
latter
 
group
 
will
 
support
 
their
 
peers
 
in
 
catching
 
up
 
on
 
what
 
they
 
missed
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
class,
 
acting
 
as
 
valuable
 
resource
 
persons
 
and

Welfare
 
schemes
 
Beside
 
the
 
above
 
schemes,
 
the
 
following
 
incentives
 
and
 
support
 
are
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
Government
 
to
 
the
 
students.
 
They
 
are
 
speciﬁc
 
to
 
certain
 
grades
 
but
 
provided
 
to
 
all
 
students
 
in
 
the
 
respective
 
classes.
 
They
 
will
 
augment
 
the
 
enrolment,
 
attendance,
 
reduce
 
drop
 
and
 
complete
 
education,
 
successfully.

The

used
 
for
 
analysing
 
various
 
tools
 
is
 
adapted
 
from
 
the
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitude,

(KAP)
 
Model.
  
The
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitudes,
 
and

(KAP)
 
model,
 
also
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
the
 
Knowledge,
 
Attitudes,
 
Belief,
 
and
 
Practices
 
(KABP)
 
survey,
 
is
 
a
 
methodological
 
instrument
 
that
 
was
 
ﬁrst
 
developed
 
as
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
understand
 
family
 
planning
 
practices
 
around
 
the
 
world
 
(Cleland,
 
1973;
 
Ratcliffe,
 
1976).
 
 
Originating
 
from
 
the
 
ﬁelds
 
of
 
family
 
planning
 
and
 
population
 
studies
 
in
 
the
 
1960s,
 
the
 
KAP
 
model
 
was
 
developed
 
and
 
recognized
 
as
 
a
 
popular
 
survey
 
instrument
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
of
 
social
 
research;
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
relationship
 
among
 
knowledge,
 
attitudes,
 
and
 
practices.
 
Scholars
 
have
 
utilised
 
the

Austrian

and

of
 
Education,
 
Culture
 
and

2021).
 
The
 
KAP
 
survey
 
framework
 
primarily
 
measures,
 
as
 
the
 
name
 
suggests,
 
three
 
aspects
 
of
 
Life
 
skill
 
behaviour
 
(1)
 
The
 
knowledge
 
that
 
individuals
 
have
 
regarding
 
life
 
skill
 
education,
 
mainly
 
referring
 
to
  
knowledge
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
life
 
skills
 
gained;
 
(2)
 
The
 
attitudes
 
that
 
individuals
 
hold
 
toward
 
perception
 
of
 
parents
 
and
 
students
 
towards
 
life
 
skill
 
education
 
and
 
(3)
 
The
 
practices
 
that
 
individuals
 
partake
 
in,
 
with
 
regards
 
to
 
addressing
 
an
 
issue.
 
Previous
 
studies
 
have
 
identiﬁed
 
many
 
interconnections
 
among
 
knowledge,
 
attitudes,
 
and
 
practices
 
(
 
Valente
 
et
 
al.,
 
1998
).
 
In
 
the
 
current
 
study
 
we
 
will
 
evaluate
 
the
 
Information
 
gathered
  
in
 
terms
 
of
 
knowledge,
 
attitude,
 
practises
 
relationship
 
and
 
explore
 
how
 
the
 
knowledge
 
of
 
issues
 
and
 
possession
 
of
 
skills
 
are
 
required
 
for
 
behavioural
 
change
 
which
 
would
 
lead
 
to
 
the
 
formation
 
of
 
behavioural
 
intention.
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
above
 
KAP
 
surveys
 
would
 
help
 
reveal
 
misconceptions
 
or
 
misunderstandings
 
that
 
may
 
represent
 
obstacles
 
to
 
the
 
activities
 
that
 
we
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
implement
 
and
 
potential
 
barriers
 
to
 
behaviour
 
change

Descriptive
 
statistics
 
such
 
as

will
 
be
 
widely
 
used
 
along
 
with

Inferential
 
Statistics
 
Inferential
 
statistics
 
have
 
two
 
main
 
uses:
 
making
 
estimates
 
about
 
populations,.
 
testing
 
hypotheses
 
to
 
draw
 
conclusions
 
about
 
populations.
  
There
 
are
 
two
 
main
 
types
 
of
 
inferential
 
statistics
 
-
 
hypothesis
 
testing
 
and
 
regression
 
analysis-Multiple-ANOVA/Multiple

and
 
the
 
applicable
 
ones.

co-relations
 
and

causal
 
relationships
 
are
 
almost
 
impossible.
 
Descriptive
 
Statistics
 
Descriptive
 
statistics
 
will
 
initially
 
be
 
done
 
with
 
frequency
 
tables
 
and
 
cross-tabulations.
 
Further
 
heterogeneity
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
to
 
further
 
unpack
 
the
 
impacts
 
at
 
various
 
sub-group
 
levels.
 
Heterogeneity
 
Analysis
 
Role
 
of
 
externalities:
 
CMS
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
directional
 
hypothesis
 
about
 
how
 
the
 
programme
 
will
 
differentially
 
affect
 
individuals
 
and
 
who
 
support
 
interventions
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
not.
 
It
 
is
 
possible
 
that
 
program
 
participants
 
might
 
beneﬁt
 
more
 
from
 
the
 
programme
 
as
 
they
 
already
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
credit
 
and
 
other
 
institutional
 
beneﬁts.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
household
 
assessment
 
will
 
be
 
facilitated
 
with
 
qualiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
through
 
a
 
CAPI
 
administered
 
tool.
 
The
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
will
 
help
 
to
 
understand
 
enabling
 
pathways
 
and
 
barriers
 
that
 
can
 
improve
 
the
 
implementation
 
model

systemic
 
process
 
documents
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
taken
 
as
 
evidence
 
for
 
scaling
 
up.
 
These
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
observations
 
would
 
provide
 
an
 
insight
 
into
 
the

Quality
 
Assurance
 
Ensuring
 
a
 
good
 
quality
 
assurance
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
survey
 
will
 
go
 
a
 
long
 
way
 
in
 
ensuring
 
high
 
quality
 
data.
 
The
 
quality
 
assurance
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
research
 
will
 
be
 
ensured
 
through
 
the
 
following
 
process:
 
●
 
Detailed
 
overall
 
planning
 
for
 
ﬁeld
 
work,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
monitored
 
closely,
 
every
 
day,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
survey
 
tasks
 
planned,
 
survey
 
tasks
 
achieved
 
and
 
variance.
 
●
 
Each
 
interview
 
will
 
be
 
tracked
 
via
 
GPS
 
location,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
automated
 
and
 
done
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
interviews.
 
●
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
Field
 
Manager
 
will
 
also
 
make
 
monitoring
 
visits
 
to
 
appraise
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
evaluation
 
and
 
monitoring
 
tasks
 
performed
 
by
 
the
 
on-ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
provide
 
feedback.
 
●
 
The
 
Field
 
Manager
 
will
 
maintain
 
a
 
spreadsheet
 
containing
 
the
 
details
 
of
 
the
 
enumerator-wise
 
number
 
of
 
completed
 
surveys
 
against
 
the
 
target.
 
This
 
document
 
will
 
be
 
shared
 
with
 
the
 
relevant
 
stakeholders
 
of
 
the
 
programme
 
team.
 
 
●
 
Monitoring
 
dashboards
 
will
 
be
 
prepared
 
by
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
progress
 
made
 
on
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
front
 
and
 
triangulate
 
it
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis
 
with
 
the
 
document
 
maintained
 
by
 
the
 
Field
 
Manager.
 
 
●
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
check
 
for
 
outliers
 
and
 
variations
 
in
 
real-time
 
and
 
give
 
feedback
 
to
 
the
 
on-ﬁeld
 
data
 
collection
 
team.
 
The
 
team
 
then
 
either
 
makes
 
corrections
 
or
 
retains
 
the
 
data
 
with
 
valid
 
reasoning,
 
thus
 
reducing
 
the
 
post-collection
 
cleaning
 
effort.
 
 
●
 
During
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
data
 
collection,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
and
 
ﬁeld

teamwork
 
in
 
tandem,
 
ensuring
 
to
 
close
 
loops
 
with
 
each
 
other
 
over
 
daily
 
calls
 
and
 
weekly/bi-monthly
 
calls
 
with
 
the
 
funding
 
organisations.
 
 
●
 
Online
 
support
 
and
 
monitoring
 
visits
 
will
 
ensure
 
the
 
veracity
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
and
 
the
 
thoroughness
 
of
 
qualitative
 
information.
 
Monitoring
 
visits
 
will
 
bring
 
in
 
the
 
qualitative
 
information
 
that
 
will
 
feed
 
into
 
the
 
monitoring
 
of
 
quantitative
 
data.
 
●
 
Spot-check
 
visits
 
–
 
Random
 
and
 
unannounced
 
visits
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
State
 
Coordinators
 
and
 
Supervisors
 
to
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
location
 
of
 
each
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
to
 
cross-check
 
the
 
accuracy
 
and
 
completeness
 
of
 
data.
 
This
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
following:
 
●
 
Check
 
if
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator
 
interviewed
 
the
 
correct,
 
desired
 
and
 
intended
 
respondents.
 
●
 
Obtain
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
household
 
members
 
on
 
whether
 
a
 
reported
 
visit
 
(by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator)
 
was
 
indeed
 
made.
 
●
 
Find
 
out
 
about
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator’s
 
conduct
 
during
 
visits.
 
●
 
Discuss
 
any
 
concerns
 
of
 
community
 
(Registered/
 
sample/target
 
population)
 
during
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
work
 
●
 
Verify
 
events
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
reported
 
by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator.
 
●
 
Back-Check
 
-
 
The
 
back-check
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
Supervisors.
 
The
 
interviewees
 
will
 
be
 
contacted
 
telephonically
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
5%
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
indicators
 
will
 
be
 
checked
 
for
 
their
 
authenticity
 
and
 
accuracy.
 
This
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
done
 
randomly
 
for
 
each
 
Field
 
Research
 
team.

Data
 
collection
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
component
 
of
 
evaluation
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
necessary
 
that
 
the
 
data
 
collected
 
be
 
accurate
 
and
 
of
 
optimum
 
quality.
 
The
 
process
 
for
 
collecting
 
this
 
data
 
should
 
also
 
be
 
efﬁcient
 
in
 
terms
 
of

can
 
be
 
divided
 
into
 
multiple

Anticipated
 
Risks
 
and
 
Mitigation
 
plan
 
The
 
risks
 
that
 
are
 
anticipated
 
at
 
this
 
stage
 
are
 
mentioned
 
below:
 
●
 
A
 
small
 
proportion
 
of
 
the
 
CAPI
 
devices
 
usually
 
face
 
technical
 
issues
 
(blanking
 
of
 
screen,
 
keyboard
 
issues,
 
etc.)
 
daily.
 
For
 
small
 
errors,
 
these
 
devices
 
will
 
be
 
rectiﬁed
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
from
 
the
 
supervisor
 
personnel,
 
who
 
will
 
provide
 
instructions
 
over
 
the
 
telephone
 
using
 
toll
 
free
 
numbers.
 
In
 
case
 
a
 
device
 
is
 
irreparable,
 
the
 
device
 
will
 
be
 
replaced.
 
 
●
 
CAPI
 
based
 
surveys
 
are
 
usually
 
not
 
conducted
 
in
 
areas
 
affected
 
by
 
political
 
unrest.
 
There
 
is
 
always
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
teams
 
being
 
kidnapped
 
and
 
the
 
devices
 
being
 
retained
 
or
 
conﬁscated
 
by
 
local
 
stakeholders.
 
Careful
 
planning
 
will
 
be
 
undertaken
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
MagicBus
 
Foundation
 
team
 
to
 
protect
 
the
 
teams
 
and
 
the
 
devices
 
while
 
survey
 
is
 
on-going
 
in
 
these
 
areas.
 
At
 
CMS
 
we
 
have
 
insurance
 
coverage
 
for
 
full
 
time
 
employees.
 
 
Networking
 
consultants
 
are
 
having
 
their
 
own
 
personal
 
insurance
 
plans
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
not
 
responsible
 
for
 
that.
 
However,
 
if
 
any
 
unforeseen
 
incidents
 
happen
 
during
 
ﬁeld
 
work,
 
organisations
 
support
 
the
 
network
 
consultants/part-time
 
employees.
 
●
 
Drop-out
 
of
 
trained
 
interviewers
 
–
 
especially
 
due
 
to
 
illness
 
–
 
is
 
always
 
a
 
risk.
 
Extra
 
enumerators
 
will
 
be
 
recruited
 
before
 
training
 
to
 
replace
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
dropouts.
 
The
 
COVID19
 
situation
 
may
 
exacerbate
 
the
 
situation,
 
but
 
we
 
will
 
recruit
 
additional
 
interviewers
 
for
 
this.
 
 
●
 
While
 
the
 
unlock
 
5
 
guidelines
 
say
 
that
 
no
 
restrictions
 
apply
 
on
 
any
 
economic
 
activity,
 
any
 
change
 
in
 
government
 
advisory
 
might
 
delay
 
the
 
timelines.
 
Also
 
travel
 
within
 
containment
 
zones
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
possible.
 
We
 
have
 
recruited
 
local
 
staff
 
to
 
avoid
 
intra-state,
 
intra-district
 
travel
 
but
 
if
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
villages/respondents
 
come
 
in
 
a
 
containment
 
zone,
 
it
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
delays
 
and
 
higher
 
non-response
 
could
 
be
 
anticipated.
 
We
 
will
 
need
 
additional
 
replacement
 
samples
 
as
 
a
 
mitigating
 
strategy.

It
 
is
 
important
 
that
 
all
 
preparatory

happen
 
in
 
a
 
planned

As
 
the
 
study
 
involves
 
physical
 
surveys
 
during
 
the
 
COVID-19

it
 
is
 
crucial
 
that
 
the

the
 
implementing
 
partner,
 
should
 
support
 
us
 
timely
 
in

on
 
behalf
 
of

India
 
Foundation
 
and
 
collecting
 
data
 
for
 
the

●
 
Introducing
 
CMS
 
to
 
local
 
partners.
 
With
 
the
 
support
 
of
 
a
 
local
 
client,
 
an
 
introductory
 
meet
 
or
 
call
 
will
 
be
 
set
 
up
 
between
 
the
 
research
 
agency
 
(CMS)
 
and
 
the
 
local
 
implementing
 
partner.
  
This
 
call
 
will
 
be
 
facilitated
 
by
 
the
 
programme
 
team
 
and
 
it
 
will
 
help
 
in
 
building
 
a
 
good
 
rapport
 
with
 
the
 
respondent.
  
The
 
introductory
 
call
 
will
 
provide
 
background
 
about
 
the
 
research
 
agency
 
(CMS);
 
who
 
we
 
are
 
(organisation
 
and
 
individual),
 
purpose
 
and
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
study;
 
and
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
expectations
 
from
 
them.
 
This
 
also
 
provides
 
local
 
context
 
and
 
exceptions
 
to
 
be
 
kept
 
in
 
mind
 
while
 
visiting
 
the
 
ﬁeld.
 
●

Supporting
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
in
 
identiﬁcation
 
of
 
control
 
villages
 
and
 
program
 
respondents
 
as
 
and
 
when
 
needed.
 
●
 
Any
 
other
 
information
 
and
 
support
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
crucial
 
to
 
ﬁeld
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
analysis.
 
●
 
For
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
to
 
conduct
 
data
 
collection
 
exercises
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
fashion,
 
the
 
programme
 
team
 
in
 
each
 
district/block
 
would
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
informed
 
about
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
plan
 
and
 
support
 
needed
 
from
 
them.
 
 
●
 
Lastly,
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
would
 
request
 
for
 
timely
 
feedback
 
on
 
progress
 
of
 
work
 
so
 
that
 
course
 
correction
 
can
 
be
 
implemented,
 
and
 
study
 
objectives
 
be
 
achieved
 
as
 
intended.

Introduction
 
1.1
 
Context
 
of
 
the
 
Study
 
 
Current
 
education
 
system
 
focuses
 
on
 
imparting
 
knowledge-based
 
concepts
 
rather
 
than
 
prioritising
 
skill
 
development,
 
fostering
 
positive
 
attitudes,
 
and
 
instilling
 
core
 
values.
 
Life
 
skills
 
are
 
deﬁned
 
as
 
&quot;abilities
 
for
 
adaptive
 
positive
 
behaviour
 
that
 
enable
 
individuals
 
to
 
deal
 
effectively
 
with
 
the
 
demands
 
and
 
challenges
 
of
 
everyday
 
life&quot;
 
(WHO.
 
1993)
1
.
 
Life
 
skills,
 
from
 
this
 
perspective
 
are
 
essentially
 
those
 
abilities
 
which
 
help
 
to
 
promote
 
mental
 
well-being
 
and
 
competence
 
in
 
young
 
people
 
as
 
they
 
face
 
the
 
realities
 
of
 
life.
 
Life
 
skills
 
education
 
revolves
 
around
 
instructing
 
individuals
 
in
 
essential
 
skills
 
that
 
are
 
applicable
 
to
 
their
 
everyday
 
lives.
 
Life
 
skills,
 
when
 
taught
 
as
 
generic
 
skills
 
for
 
life,
 
are
 
taught
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
holistic
 
health
 
and
 
social
 
issues,
 
such
 
as
 
relationships,
 
learning
 
about
 
social
 
inﬂuences
 
on
 
behaviour
 
and
 
learning
 
about
 
rights
 
and
 
responsibilities
 
(WHO,
 
1996
2
).
 
This
 
form
 
of
 
education
 
encompasses
 
the
 
development
 
and
 
application
 
of
  
skills,
 
particularly
 
in
 
addressing
 
signiﬁcant
 
health
 
and
 
social
 
concerns.
 
The
 
educational
 
approach
 
involves
 
actively
 
engaging
 
children
 
and
 
adolescents
 
in
 
a
 
dynamic
 
process
 
of
 
teaching
 
and
 
learning,
 
frequently
 
drawing
 
upon
 
the
 
principles
 
of
 
social
 
learning
 
theory
 
(Bandura,
 
1977).
  
Life
 
skills
 
has
 
been
 
identiﬁed
 
as
 
an
 
essential
 
resource
 
for
 
developing
 
psychosocial,
 
emotional,
 
cognitive,
 
behavioural
 
and
 
resilience
 
skills
 
to
 
negotiate
 
every
 
day
 
challenges
 
and
 
productive
 
involvement
 
in
 
the
 
community
 
(Desai,
 
2010
3
).
 
These
 
skills
 
play
 
a
 
vital
 
role
 
in
 
helping
 
young
 
individuals
 
effectively
 
navigate
 
and
 
resolve
 
the
 
difﬁculties
 
they
 
encounter
 
while
 
striving
 
to
 
become
 
active
 
and
 
valuable
 
members
 
of
 
society.
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
life
 
skills
 
training
 
is
 
to
 
facilitate
 
the
 
acquisition
 
of
 
skills
 
that
 
have
 
a
 
direct
 
impact
 
on
 
health
 
and
 
behaviour
 
within
 
the
 
social
 
environment.
 
Today's
 
Indian
 
adolescents
 
have
 
more
 
information
 
and
 
cultural
 
alternatives
 
than
 
before,
 
but
 
economic
 
dependence
 
on
 
parents
 
limits
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
make
 
choices.
 
To
 
succeed
 
globally
 
and
 
become
 
independent
 
adults,
 
they
 
need
 
to
 
enhance
 
their
 
psychosocial
 
competencies
 
through
 
life
 
skills
 
training.
 
This
 
training
 
equips
 
them
 
with
 
the
 
necessary
 
skills
 
to
 
navigate
 
a
 
competitive
 
and
 
rapidly
 
changing
 
world
 
(Narasimha
 
&amp;
 
Rao,
 
2011
4
).
 
 
India,
 
with
 
its
 
vast
 
population,
 
faces
 
numerous
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
education
 
and
 
skill
 
development
 
sector,
 
particularly
 
for
 
adolescents.
 
It
 
has
 
been
 
observed
 
that
 
while
 
nearly
 
all
 
children
 
are
 
enrolled
 
in
 
primary
 
schools,
 
the
 
transition
 
to
 
higher
 
education
 
remains
 
low,
 
with
 
only
 
33%
 
progressing
 
to
 
Grade
 
11
 
and
 
a
 
mere
 
10%
 
pursuing
 
higher
 
education.

Furthermore,
 
workforce
 
participation
 
rates
 
are
 
declining
 
in
 
rural
 
areas,
 
and
 
gender
 
disparities
 
in
 
salaried
 
employment
 
persist,
 
posing
 
signiﬁcant
 
barriers
 
to
 
economic
 
empowerment
 
and
 
social
 
progress.
 
Recognizing
 
the
 
critical
 
need
 
to
 
address
 
these
 
challenges,
 
the
 
Magic
 
Bus
 
India
 
Foundation
 
(MBIF)
 
has
 
initiated
 
the
 
&quot;Government
 
Partnership
 
Programme
 
in
 
Haryana.&quot;
 
This
 
program
 
aims
 
to
 
provide
 
life
 
skills
 
education
 
to
 
adolescents
 
from
 
underserved
 
backgrounds,
 
empowering
 
them
 
with
 
the
 
necessary
 
tools
 
to
 
navigate
 
their
 
journey
 
from
 
childhood
 
to
 
livelihood.
 
By
 
focusing
 
on
 
skill
 
development
 
and
 
fostering
 
a
 
supportive
 
environment,
 
the
 
program
 
seeks
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
required
 
skills
 
and
 
available
 
opportunities,
 
ultimately
 
enabling
 
adolescents
 
to
 
make
 
info
 
rmed
 
decisions
 
about
 
their
 
futures.
 
The
 
Government
 
Partnership
 
Programme
 
in
 
Haryana
 
is
 
being
 
implemented
 
in
 
collaboration
 
with
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Education,
 
Haryana,
 
and
 
Samagra
 
Governance.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
three
 
districts:
 
Gurugram,
 
Panchkula,
 
and
 
Yamuna
 
Nagar.
 
The
 
program
 
targets
 
an
 
outreach
 
of
 
80,009
 
adolescents
 
and
 
1,358
 
teachers
 
across
 
679
 
schools
 
in
 
the
 
academic
 
year
 
2023-24.
 
The
 
curriculum
 
will
 
be
 
delivered
 
to
 
students
 
in
 
Classes
 
6
 
to
 
8
 
through
 
a
 
cohort-based
 
approach,
 
with
 
a
 
transition
 
to
 
higher
 
grades
 
in
 
subsequent
 
years.
 
 
The
 
program
 
adopts
 
an
 
innovative
 
teacher-led
 
model,
 
wherein
 
teachers
 
are
 
trained
 
to
 
deliver
 
life
 
skills
 
education
 
sessions
 
to
 
students.
 
Each
 
academic
 
year,
 
students
 
will
 
receive
 
48
 
hours
 
of
 
activity-based
 
experiential
 
learning
 
sessions,
 
focusing
 
on
 
knowledge,
 
skill,
 
and
 
attitude
 
development.
 
The
 
sessions
 
will
 
be
 
designed
 
to
 
encourage
 
student
 
participation,
 
reﬂection,
 
and
 
behaviour
 
change.
 
Magic

Support
 
Ofﬁcers
 
(SSOs)
 
will
 
be
 
assigned
 
to
 
approximately
 
10-12

to
 
provide
 
training,
 
mentoring,
 
and
 
monitoring
 
support
 
to
 
teachers,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
effective
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
program.

Our
 
Understanding
 
of
 
the
 
ToR
 
The
 
evaluation
 
being
 
proposed
 
by
 
the
 
agency
 
encompasses
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
scope
 
of
 
work.
 
It
 
involves
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
an
 
evaluation
 
design
 
and
 
methodology
 
to
 
assess
 
students
 
from
 
Grade
 
6th
 
to
 
10th.
 
These
 
students
 
will
 
undergo
 
a
 
transformative
 
educational
 
experience,
 
as
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
equipped
 
with
 
essential
 
life
 
skills
 
(cognitive,
 
social
 
and
 
emotional)
 
consisting
 
of
 
11
 
skills
 
and
 
35
 
competencies
 
that
 
are
 
crucial
 
for
 
thriving
 
in
 
the
 
21st
 
century
.
 
These
 
skills
 
include
 
effective
 
communication,
 
critical
 
thinking
 
and
 
problem
 
solving,
 
collaborative
 
teamwork,
 
and
 
self-awareness,
 
among
 
others.
 
 
 
In
 
collaboration
 
with
 
the
 
Department
 
of
 
Education,
 
Haryana,
 
and
 
Samagra
 
Governance,
 
Magic
 
Bus
 
India
 
Foundation
 
(MBIF)
 
is
 
implementing
 
a
 
Life
 
Skills
 
Education
 
program
 
for
 
adolescents
 
in
 
Haryana.
 
The
 
program
 
is
 
made
 
possible
 
through
 
the
 
support
 
of
 
the
 
Michael
 
and
 
Susan
 
Dell
 
Foundation
 
(MSDF).
 
The
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
on
 
empowering
 
teachers
 
to
 
lead
 
and
 
deliver
 
effective
 
life
 
skills
 
education
 
to
 
adolescents
 
in
 
the
 
region.

for
 
conducting
 
reliable
 
research

district
 
and
 
30
 
students
 
of
 
class
 
6th
 
to
 
8th
 
will
 
be
 
selected,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
900
 
students
 
per
 
district
 
and
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
2700
 
students.
 
 
Third
 
stage
 
of
 
sampling:
 
Additionally,
 
10
 
students
 
from
  
class
 
9th
 
will
 
be
 
selected
 
from
 
each
 
school,

A
 
critical
 
review
 
of
 
the
 
Theory
 
of
 
Change
 
will
 
allow
 
us
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
Causal
 
Assumptions
 
and
 
Implementation
 
assumptions
.
 
To
 
understand
 
the
 
implementation
 
assumptions,
 
it
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
empathise
 
with
 
the
 
student’s
 
journey
 
from
 
primary
 
to
 
successful
 
completion
 
in
 
Life
 
skill
 
development.
 
This
 
will
 
be
 
critical
 
to
 
capture
 
key
 
aspects
 
that
 
would
 
challenge
 
the
 
program’s
 
success
 
and
 
failure.
 
3.2
 
A
 
timetable/implementation
 
plan
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
overall
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
planned
 
evaluations,
 
a
 
work
 
plan
 
is
 
developed.
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
be
 
rolled
 
out
 
in
 
six
 
stages:
 
Stage
 
1: 
 
Inception
 
Meeting
 
-
 
In
 
the
 
inception
 
meeting,
 
CMS
 
will
 
discuss
 
the
 
planned
 
evaluations
 
with
 
the
 
Magic
 
Bus
 
team.
 
Accordingly,
 
CMS’s
 
core
 
team
 
and
 
expert/knowledge
 
partners
 
would
 
conduct
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
desk
 
review
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
and
 
other
 
documents
 
and
 
develop
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
visit
 
plan,
 
overall
 
study
 
framework
 
and
 
methods.
 
This
 
stage
 
will
 
be
 
completed
 
within
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
week
 
from
 
the
 
date
 
of
 
signing
 
the
 
contract.
 
 
Stage
 
2:
 
Detailed
 
methodology,
 
Inception
 
report
 
and
 
Field
 
visit
 
plan
 
–
 
Planning
 
discussions
 
will
 
be
 
carried
 
out
 
with
 
the
 
Magic
 
Bus
 
team
 
regarding
 
logistics,
 
resource
 
availability
 
and
 
facilitation
 
for
 
the
 
planned
 
evaluations
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
visits.
 
Based
 
on
 
these,
 
an
 
inception
 
report
 
would
 
be
 
submitted
 
for
 
the
 
planned
 
evaluations
 
with
 
the
 
design
 
of
 
the
 
respective
 
evaluations/studies,
 
their
 
proposed
 
methodology
 
and
 
sampling
 
plans
 
and
 
a
 
detailed
 
plan
 
on
 
the
 
sequence
 
of
 
activities
 
(including
 
list
 
of
 
interviews,
 
focus
 
group
 
discussions,
 
etc.
 
and
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
visit
 
plan).
 
These
 
will
 
be
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
the
 
scope
 
of
 
work
 
and
 
the
 
prescribed
 
timelines.
 
Stage

–
 
Two
 
weeks
 
will
 
be
 
utilised
 
for
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
study
 
instruments,
 
questionnaire
 
design
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
induction
 
and
 
training.
 
Once
 
the
 
tools
 
have
 
been
 
designed,
 
the
 
ﬁnalisation
 
of
 
the
 
framework
 
and
 
survey
 
operations
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
with
 
the
 
Magic

team.
 
CMS
 
will
 
furnish
 
completed
 
tools
 
and
 
make
 
required
 
modiﬁcations
 
in
 
two
 
weeks
 
for
 
each
 
planned
 
evaluation.

Confidentiality
 
and
 
Ethical
 
Considerations
 
 
Ensuring
 
anonymity
 
and
 
protecting
 
respondent
 
identity
 
is
 
a
 
mandatory
 
requirement,
 
and
 
our
 
organisation
 
adheres
 
to
 
stringent
 
protocols
 
for
 
maintaining
 
the
 
highest
 
level
 
of
 
conﬁdentiality.
 
We
 
have
 
implemented
 
robust
 
measures
 
to
 
safeguard
 
data
 
security
 
and
 
privacy
 
across
 
our
 
digital
 
tools
 
and
 
platforms,
 
including
 
encryption
 
of
 
survey
 
forms
 
and
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
for
 
enumerators
 
on
 
data
 
sharing,
 
accompanied
 
by
 
conﬁdentiality
 
contracts.
 
Our
 
enumerators
 
undergo
 
comprehensive
 
training
 
to
 
remain
 
unbiased
 
and
 
refrain
 
from
 
sharing
 
any
 
personal
 
opinions,
 
claims,
 
or
 
identifying
 
information.
 
They
 
are
 
bound
 
by
 
a
 
conﬁdentiality
 
agreement
 
with
 
CMS,
 
committing
 
to
 
the
 
proper
 
use
 
of
 
conﬁdential
 
information
 
solely
 
for
 
the
 
designated
 
purposes
 
outlined
 
in
 
their
 
training,
 
and
 
not
 
disclosing
 
it
 
to
 
any
 
third
 
party.
 
Additionally,
 
our
 
enumerators
 
are
 
instructed
 
not
 
to
 
copy,
 
retain,
 
or
 
share
 
any
 
written
 
information
 
that
 
could
 
potentially
 
reveal
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
individuals,
 
and
 
all
 
conﬁdential
 
information,
 
such
 
as
 
questionnaires,
 
notes,
 
photographs,
 
and
 
memoranda,
 
is
 
handed
 
over
 
to
 
the
 
team
 
upon
 
the
 
conclusion
 
of
 
the
 
surveys.

Quality
 
Control
 
Mechanism
 
With
 
over
 
200
 
projects
 
and
 
an
 
in-house
 
portfolio
 
for
 
data
 
collection,
 
CMS
 
has
 
strong
 
expertise
 
in
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
This
 
becomes
 
especially
 
relevant
 
in
 
the
 
post
 
pandemic
 
scenario
 
wherein
 
the
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
following
 
stringent
 
guidelines
 
around
 
safety
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
following
 
international
 
standards.
 
 
After
 
the
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
ﬁnalised
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
MAGIC
 
BUS
 
FOUNDATION,
 
researchers
 
from
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
will
 
conduct
 
a
 
pilot
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
well
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
location,
 
project
 
context
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
cultural
 
point
 
of
 
view.
 
Once
 
the
 
post-pilot
 
changes
 
are
 
completed,
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
scripted
 
and
 
tested
 
in-house
 
(for
 
skips
 
and
 
validations)
 
by
 
researchers
 
and
 
tested
 
in
 
a
 
setting
 
similar
 
to
 
that
 
of
 
the
 
intended
 
sample.
 
Th
e
 
ﬁnal
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
translated
 
into
 
local
 
language
 
by
 
experienced
 
thematic
 
translators
 
to
 
retain
 
the
 
essence
 
and
 
yet
 
contextualise
 
for
 
the
 
local
 
language.

Monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Poor
 
quality
 
data
 
reduces
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
policy
 
intervention,
 
and
 
can
 
also
 
require
 
a
 
repeat
 
of
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring
 
enumerator
 
quality
 
controls
 
with
 
spot
 
checks,
 
back
 
checks
 
(on
 
major
 
topics,
 
time
 
taken,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
looping
 
mechanisms.
 
 
Data
 
management
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
yet
 
often
 
overlooked
 
aspect
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
MAGIC
 
BUS
 
FOUNDATION
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.
 
The
 
research
 
team
 
has
 
strong
 
experience
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
multiple
 
scripting
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Survey
 
CTO,
 
Commcare,
 
ODK,
 
etc.
 
and
 
experience
 
in
 
online

is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
data
 
cleaning.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
validation
 
exercise
 
is
 
completed
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
post-cleaning
 
efforts
 
including
 
id
 
variable
 
checking,
 
outlier
 
tagging,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
replacements,
 
illogical
 
value
 
assessment,
 
addressing
 
typos,
 
survey
 
codes,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
adding
 
labels.
 
Irregularities
 
and
 
corrections
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
documented,
 
but
 
changes
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
after
 
introspection
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
insights.

    <content>Baseline Assessment: MBIF - Government 
Partnership for Life Skills Education in Haryana 
Submitted by Catalyst 
Management Services 


Objective of the Assessment 
1. To set the baseline values on key indicators for the programme. 
2. To measure the outcomes and impact of the programme at the endline level. 
3. To assess change in perception of parents and other stakeholders towards life skill education 
4. To understand the parents’ perceptions and their observation towards changed behaviour and attitude 
amongst adolescents. 
5. To assess the benefit of programme on direct and indirect beneficiaries of the programme 


Scope of the Assessment 
The Study was conducted in three districts of Haryana viz. Panchkula, Gurugram and Yamunanagar 
The Overall Sample (Quantitative and Qualitative) agreed numbers Vs actuals are depicted below 
The Study Covered the Life Skills of the student across the ecosystem 
The Agreed Vs Actual for the Qualitative sample do not match due to 
unavailability of CYLs in Panchkula 
To get more clarity at the systemic level a Interview (KII) was also 
scheduled with State official

Presentations of 
Findings 

Research Limitation 
•The non-triangulated results might have biases as there is a chance of inaccurate information. 
•The study was conducted in Gurugram, Panchkula and Yamunanagar districts, Haryana. The study  
findings of cannot be generalized to another setting or populations 
•The Scoring methodology of student survey tool, developed externally, is unclear and limits the reliability 
of life skill assessments. 
•Snowball Sampling for parental observations faced challenges in mapping  of parents dataset with 
students dataset and couldn’t be done based on student SRN ID for all 1800 parents sample collected 
•In the village survey, inconsistent data arose due to the unavailability of multiple respondents. As a result 
analysis at the village level was relied on the Qualitative data and secondary research

Research Methodology 


Student Life Skill Assessment (Tool) 
● The Life Skill Assessment tool, synonymous with the term &quot;Future Readiness Tool,&quot; encompasses a holistic evaluation of essential 
skills for navigating the challenges of tomorrow 
● To provide a nuanced analysis, the overall life skill is categorized into three distinct domains: Thinking Skill, Relationship Skill, and 
Leadership &amp; Entrepreneurship Skill (EP) 
● Within each domain, a detailed exploration is conducted through further subdivision into specific sub-domains, as highlighted in

● Conducted a comprehensive assessment of 
life skills among 3600 students using a 
dedicated Student Life Skill Assessment Tool 
● Objective: Evaluate the proficiency levels of 
life skills among the student population to 
identify areas of potential enhancement 
● Ensured equitable representation by 
administering the assessment tool across a 
diverse sample of students in the study 
districts 
● Achieved a balanced gender distribution, 
with 56% male and 44% female students 
participating in the assessment 
● Implemented a grade-wise approach, 
distributing the assessment tool evenly 
across 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th grades, with 
each grade accounting for 25% of the total 
sample 


Student Life Skill Assessment (Life Skill Score) 
● The overall life skill score is higher 
for girls than boys across all the 
districts 
● Notably, the gender-based 
difference in life skill scores is the 
highest in Yamuna Nagar. 
● Grade-wise breakdown: 
○ 6th grade: 12.59 
○ 7th grade: 12.93 
○ 8th grade: 13.32 
○ 9th grade: 13.49 
● These insights shows that there are 
gender based variation in the life 
skill proficiency 


Student Life Skill Assessment (Mean Domain Score) 
● Within domain girls student have a 
higher score in thinking skill in 
comparison with boys 
● Similarly in the domain of Leadership 
&amp; Entrepreneurship, girls students 
score higher than boys 
● Within domains, Leadership &amp; 
Entrepreneurship skills outshine 
Thinking skills, revealing nuanced 
strengths and areas for targeted 
development 


Student Life Skill Assessment (Mean Subdomain Score) 
● The mean subdomain score of 
delayed gratification is the highest 
(2.1) of all subdomains 
● The mean subdomain score of 
creative thinking is the lowest (0.0) 
of all subdomains 
● Subdomain scores across districts 
closely mirror the overall mean 
subdomain score 
● Creative thinking skill consists of 
questions around situational 
descriptive response in the 
assessment tool 


Student Life Skill Score Distribution (Overall) 
● Majority of the students (68.26%) have 
a mean life skill score in the range 
(9.92 - 16.24) and the density function 
show that they are ~10% more likely to 
occur 
● 15.87% of the students have a mean 
life skill score in the range (3.6 - 9.92) 
● Similarly, 15.87% of the students have 
a mean life skill score in the range 
(16.24 - 22.56) 


Student Life Skill Score Distribution (By gender and district) 
● The distribution of Overall Life skill 
score  is normally distributed 
● The distribution of Overall Life skill 
score across gender &amp; district is 
normally distributed. 
● The estimated mean life skill score for 
both gender is ~13 and since the plot is 
normally distributed the estimated 
value closely similar to the population 
mean life skill score 
● The density function of the normal 
distributions shows girls are more 
likely to have the mean life skills score 
of 13 as compared to boys  
● The bell curve of the sample 
distribution implies that the sample 
characteristics can be reliably 
extrapolated to the larger population
