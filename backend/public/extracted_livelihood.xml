The survey worksheet
This worksheet specifies all of the groups, questions, and other fields in your survey form, each in its own row. Aside from overall settings and lists of multiple-choice options, everything about your survey form is specified in this worksheet.

For more help, see the following help topic: How do I design my form?

This column specifies the type of the field or group. It has to follow a pre-specified format, and Excel's conditional formatting has been used to auto-highlight rows that appear to have a valid type column -- so, if you are using Excel and your row is not automatically highlighted, re-check that you have entered the type properly. See below for an exhaustive list of brief examples.	This column specifies the name of the field or group. Field names must be unique, and they cannot include any spaces or punctuation. Example: age	For those field types that present a user interface, this column is where you put the primary text for the question or field. You can include line-breaks in your label text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac.	Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language.	Text in this column, if any, will appear italicized beneath the field's label. You can include line-breaks in your hint text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac.	Any hint:languagename column (e.g., hint:tamil) may be added in order to provide hints in an alternative language.	If you want to default the user's entry or selection for a given field, you can specify a number or some text in this column. 

Alternatively, you can specify an expression for dynamically calculating the field's default entry or selection, in the calculation column. See the following help topic for more details: How can I provide default entries or selections for users filling out my form? 	For field types that allow multiple appearances, you can specify the appearance style in this column (e.g., quick or minimal for select_one fields). See the individual examples below.	Enter an expression into this column to validate entered or selected values. The user will only be allowed to proceed to the next question when the expression evaluates to true. Use the constraint builder to build new constraint expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) Example: . &lt; 130	If the user tries to move forward but the constraint expression is false, a generic &quot;That entry is invalid&quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column.	Any constraint message:languagename column (e.g., constraint message:tamil) may be added in order to provide constraint messages in an alternative language.	Enter an expression into this column to control when a field or group displays to the user (i.e., to control when it is &quot;relevant&quot;). The field or group will only show up to users when the expression in this column evaluates to true; otherwise, it will remain hidden. Use the relevance builder to build new relevance expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) Example: ${age} &lt; 18	Enter yes into this column to temporarily disable a field. (Rarely used.)	Enter yes into this column to require that users enter or select a value before continuing.	If the user tries to move forward without entering or selecting a value for a required field, a generic &quot;Sorry, this response is required&quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column.	Any required message:languagename column (e.g., required message:tamil) may be added in order to provide required messages in an alternative language.	Enter yes into this column to make it read-only (a user can see the field, but cannot enter or select a value). (Rarely used, because note fields, which are by nature read-only, are automatically read-only regardless of what is specified here.)	This column specifies the expression to use for a calculate field, or the expression to use for calculating the default entry or selection for a visible form field. Use the calculation builder to build new calculation expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.)	For a begin repeat row, this column can specify the number of times to repeat the group of questions. (Can be a fixed count like 3 or a reference to an earlier field like ${numhh_members}.)	To include an image to display for a field (in addition to or in lieu of its label), its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. Example: paddy.png	To include a sound clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. Example: explanation.3gpp	To include a video clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. Example: demonstration.mp4	Any media:image:languagename column (e.g., media:image:tamil) may be added in order to provide images for an alternative language.	Any media:audio:languagename column (e.g., media:audio:tamil) may be added in order to provide audio clips for an alternative language.	Any media:video:languagename column (e.g., media:video:tamil) may be added in order to provide video clips for an alternative language.	When filtering lists of multiple-choice options, this column specifies, for each field, which prior field should be used when filtering the list of options. For more details, see the following help topic: How can I filter the list of multiple-choice options presented to users? Example: filter=${survey_region}	This column can specify an optional note to appear with the field in printable versions of the survey form, in order to explain when groups or fields will appear (i.e., when they are relevant), what restrictions there are on user entries (i.e., what constraints apply), etc.	This column can specify optional text or symbols to appear in the response area to the right of questions in printable versions of the survey form. For a text field, for example, you might put something like |___|___| if you are looking for two letters or numbers; or, for a checkbox, you might put a hollow square like □ (this is a special HTML character: enter &quot;&amp;#9633;&quot;, without quotes, into this column); finally, for a radio button, you might simply enter a capital O.	Enter yes into this column to indicate that a field in an encrypted form should be left unencrypted so that it can be published to one or more datasets. Use only for non-sensitive fields that can be left unencrypted without compromising data security. (This field is ignored for unencrypted forms.)	Enter a number of seconds that represents the minimum time enumerators should spend the first time they view the field. This represents a &quot;speed limit&quot; that can be enforced by Collect (with the Enforce minimum times for fields option within Collect's Admin Settings); alternatively, you can track violations with the following field types: &quot;speed violations count&quot;, &quot;speed violations list&quot;, and &quot;speed violations audit&quot; (see examples for these field types below).

The choices worksheet
This worksheet is for the configuration of option lists for your multiple-choice questions. For regular option lists, all possible options will be listed here, one option per row. For option lists that will be dynamically loaded from a pre-loaded .csv file, there will be a single row that indicates from which .csv columns to load the option values, labels, and images (see the following help topic: How do I dynamically load multiple-choice options from pre-loaded data?).
list_name	value	label	label:languagename	image	image:languagename	filter
This column specifies the name of a multiple-choice question type (without any spaces or punctuation). A given list of options will involve multiple rows, each with the same list_name. Example: yesno	This column specifies the internal value stored for a given choice. (It should really be called &quot;value&quot; rather than &quot;name&quot;.) Example: 1

If dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load option values.	This column specifies the label to use for a given choice, in the form's default language. Example: Yes

If dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name -- or comma-separated list of column names -- from which to load option labels for the default language.	Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language.	To include an image to display for an option, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. Example: paddy.png

If dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load image filenames.	Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide images in an alternative language.	To filter the list of options displayed, a filter value can be specified here, along with a filter expression in the choice_filter column of the survey worksheet. For example, you might have filter values like LAC and a choice_filter like filter=${survey_region}. For more details, see the following help topic: How can I filter the list of multiple-choice options presented to users?

--- Sheet: help-settings ---
The settings worksheet
This worksheet contains overall settings for your form, all specified in the second row of the worksheet. When you download a form template from your SurveyCTO server, these settings will be pre-filled for you.
form_title	form_id	version	public_key	submission_url	default_language
This is the title of your form. If you begin this title with TEST - (as in &quot;TEST - Household listing survey&quot;), it will not appear by default to users (see the following help topic: How can I prevent forms from appearing until after I am finished testing them?).	This is the unique ID that will identify the form. While the form title can have spaces and can be changed from time to time, the form ID must not contain spaces and must remain fixed for the life of the form. The form ID must also begin with a letter, and it can only include letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (no other punctuation or special characters). Example: hhlisting_round1	This is the version number of the form, which you must increase each time you modify an existing form. If you started with a form template or with one of the sample forms, then this is automatic: the version is set to a formula that automatically increments every minute. (Otherwise, you need to increment the version number yourself, taking care to keep the number of digits fixed; the version has to be a single whole number, and its number of digits has to stay the same from one version to the next. The convention is to always use a ten-digit number that represents the current date and time, e.g., 1401130917 for 9:17AM on January 13, 2014. Alternatively, you can use 10-digit numbers like 0000000001 and 0000000024 or 3-digit numbers like 001 and 024.)	This is the public key with which to encrypt all form submissions. See the following help topic for details: How do I encrypt my data?	This is the submission URL to use when submitting encrypted forms. See the following help topic for details: How do I encrypt my data?	This is the name of the language associated with labels, images, and other content when no other language is specified. For example, the label:french column is clearly in French, but the label column, which will display by default, is in an unknown language. Put the name of that default language here. See the following help topic for details: How do I translate my form into multiple languages?</content>

Introduction
 
1.1
 
Context
 
of
 
the
 
Study
 
Extreme
 
poor
 
or
 
ultra
 
poor
1
 
can
 
be
 
described
 
as
 
individuals
 
who
 
lack
 
necessary
 
assets,
 
are
 
food
 
insecure,
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
adequate
 
political
 
power
 
or
 
voice,
 
and
 
thereby,
 
enjoy
 
very
 
limited
 
access
 
to
 
utility
 
facilities,
 
ﬁnancial
 
services,
 
healthcare,
 
and,
 
in
 
general,
 
to
 
the
 
basic
 
needs
 
of
 
lives.
 
They
 
have
 
energy
 
and
 
nutritional
 
deﬁciency
 
even
 
though
 
they
 
use
 
a
 
major
 
share
 
of
 
their
 
income
 
for
 
these
 
purposes.
 
They
 
mostly
 
have
 
a
 
single
 
source
 
of
 
income
 
which
 
is
 
derived
 
majorly
 
from
 
selling
 
manual
 
labour
 
in
 
the
 
agriculture
 
sector.
 
 
Women,
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
population,
 
are
 
relatively
 
less
 
active
 
in
 
the
 
labour
 
force.
 
And
 
women
 
of
 
ultra
 
poor
 
households
 
are
 
forced
 
to
 
be
 
engaged
 
in
 
the
 
agricultural
 
sector
 
as
 
agricultural
 
day
 
labourers
 
receiving
 
a
 
discriminatory
 
wage
 
in
 
normal
 
and
 
lean
 
seasons
 
compared
 
to
 
male
 
labour.
 
[Location]
 
is
 
India’s
 
second
 
most
 
impoverished
 
state,
 
home
 
to
 
more
 
than
 
500,000
 
households
 
living
 
in
 
ultra-poverty.
 
The
 
challenges
 
of
 
these
 
families
 
go
 
beyond
 
ensuring
 
2
 
meals
 
a
 
day.
 
Not
 
only
 
are
 
they
 
food
 
insecure
 
but
 
also
 
not
 
have
 
productive
 
assets
 
like
 
land
 
or
 
livestock.
 
They
 
are
 
socially
 
excluded,
 
ﬁnancially
 
excluded,
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
predictable
 
labour
 
and
 
income,
 
nor
 
are
 
they
 
able
 
to
 
access
 
health,
 
government,
 
or
 
community
 
support
 
programs.
 
In
 
2017
 
[Client
 
Organization]
 
decided
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
such
 
ultra-poor
 
households
 
through
 
their
 
livelihood
 
project
 
titled
 
[Client’s
 
Program]
 
program
 
in
 
[Location].
 
The
 
End
 
Ultra-Poverty
 
program
 
aims
 
to
 
pull
 
1M
 
women
 
from
 
ultra-poor
 
households
 
out
 
of
 
ultra-poverty
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
5
 
years
 
by
 
improving
 
social,
 
economic,
 
and
 
gender-based
 
outcomes
 
through
 
the
 
evidence-based
 
graduation
 
approach.
 
The
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
works
 
with
 
ultra-poor
 
rural
 
households,
 
speciﬁcally
 
with
 
women
 
from
 
particularly
 
vulnerable
 
tribal
 
groups
 
living
 
in
 
the
 
interiors
 
of
 
[Location]
 
and
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
graduate
 
out
 
of
 
ultra
 
poverty.
 
 
The
 
core
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
is
 
to
 
pull
 
one
 
million
 
women
 
from
 
ultra-poor
 
households
 
and
 
alleviate
 
them
 
from
 
ultra-poverty
 
within
 
the
 
next
 
ﬁve
 
years
 
by
 
enhancing
 
social,
 
economic,
 
and
 
gender-speciﬁc
 
outcomes
 
through
 
the
 
evidence-backed
 
graduation
 
approach.
 
Achieving
 
its
 
objectives,
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
requires
 
addressing
 
several
 
constraints
 
and
 
barriers
 
that
 
ultra-poor
 
households
 
in
 
the
 
region
 
face,
 
both
 
internally,
 
within
 
the
 
household,
 
and
 
externally,
 
at
 
the
 
community
 
and
 
environmental
 
level
 
such
 
as
 
lack
 
of
 
assets,
 
skills
 
sets
 
and
 
basic
 
services,
 
and
 
low
 
levels
 
of
 
voice
 
and
 
empowerment
 
of
 
household
 
members,
 
lack
 
of
 
service
 
providers,
 
limited
 
markets,
 
restricted
 
livelihood
 
options.
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
achieve
 
its
 
objectives,
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
has
 
devised
 
a
 
sequenced
 
and
 
multifaceted
 
interventions
 
to
 
tackle
 
these
 
constraints
 
and
 
barriers.
 
These
 
interventions
 
enable
 
families
 
to
 
come
 
out
 
of
 
ultra-poverty
 
sustainably
 
in
 
a
 
deﬁned
 
time
 
period,
 
attempting
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
beneﬁciaries
 
are
 
not
 
excluded
 
either
 
socially
 
or
 
ﬁnancially
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
The
 
program
 
facilitates
 
regular
 
hand
 
holding
 
(i.e.,
 
practice
 
of
 
providing
 
consistent
 
and
 
supportive
 
guidance,
 
mentorship
 
that
 
the
 
program
 
offers
 
to
 
project
 
participants)
 
at
 
the
 
centre
 
of
 
its
 
success.
 
The
 
ultra-poor
 
are
 
highly
 
food
 
insecure
 
and
 
hence
 
the
 
program
 
starts
 
with
 
providing
 
'breathing
 
space'
 
by
 
ensuring
 
food

program
 
strategies,
 
particularly
 
those

has
 
a
 
nuanced
 
understanding
 
of
 
the

institutional
 
structure.
 
Our
 
close
 
collaboration
 
with
 
MORD

SRLMS,
 
including
 
JSLPS,
 
provides
 
a
 
solid
 
foundation
 
for
 
evaluating
 
gender-transformative
 
interventions
 
within
 
the
 
NRLM
 
ecosystem.
 
The

has
 
a
 
dedicated
 
base
 
of
 
local
 
ﬁeld
 
researchers
 
well-versed
 
with
 
the

experts,
 
persons
 
who
 
have
 
worked
 
on
 
evaluations

the
 
NRLM
 
and
 
gender
 
context,
 
bringing
 
a
 
gender
 
lens
 
to
 
the
 
evaluation
 
process,
 
recognizing
 
and
 
addressing
 
the
 
unique
 
challenges
 
and
 
opportunities
 
that
 
individuals
 
of
 
different
 
genders
 
face
 
within
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
policies
 
and
 
programs.
 
They
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
excellence
 
in
 
bridging
 
the
 
evaluation
 
gap,
 
speciﬁcally
 
focusing
 
on
 
the
 
inadequacies
 
in
 
producing
 
and
 
utilising

a
 
keen
 
eye
 
on
 
the
 
gender
 
dynamics
 
involved.
 
For
 
instance,
 
they
 
have
 
explored
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
community-based
 
producer
 
organisations,
 
appropriate
 
business
 
training,
 
information
 
sharing
 
about
 
markets,
 
and
 
asset
 
transfer/ﬁnancial
 
support
 
from
 
a
 
gender
 
lens.
 
 
Moreover,
 
our
 
advisors
 
boast
 
extensive
 
experience
 
in
 
qualitative
 
research,
 
and
 
their
 
domain
 
expertise
 
extends
 
to
 
the
 
nuanced
 
realm
 
of
 
women
 
livelihoods
 
and
 
empowerment.
 
They
 
bring
 
a
 
deep
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
challenges
 
and
 
opportunities
 
faced
 
by
 
women
 
in
 
livelihoods
 
(entrepreneurial/agriculture/labour)
 
endeavours,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
evaluation
 
process
 
is
 
attuned
 
to
 
the
 
speciﬁc
 
needs
 
and
 
contexts
 
of
 
programmes
 
targeted
 
towards
 
women.
 
This
 
inclusive
 
approach
 
enhances
 
the
 
robustness
 
and
 
relevance
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
ﬁndings,
 
providing
 
insights
 
that
 
are
 
sensitive
 
to

and
 
contributing

the
 
advancement
 
of

different
 
geographies
 
across

facilitated
 
by
 
our

by
 
ensuring
 
that
 
100%

are
 
local,
 
possessing
 
a
 
deep
 
understanding
 
of

customs,
 
and

fostering
 
a
 
stronger
 
connection
 
with

Ethical
 
considerations
 
are
 
central
 
to
 
CMS's
 
approach,
 
with
 
ﬁeld

certiﬁed
 
in
 
&quot;Research

guide
 
the
 
recruitment
 
of
 
ﬁeld

are
 
crucial
 
criteria,

of
 
our
 
research
 
experience
 
that
 
is
 
closely
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S

project.
 
Recently,
 
the
 
team
 
concluded
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
phase
 
of
 
evaluation
 
of
 
a
 
national
 
government
 
program
 
in
 
India,
 
the
 
National
 
Rural
 
Livelihood
 
Project
 
(NRLP)
 
working
 
on
 
women
 
empowerment
 
and
 
decision
 
making
 
within
 
the
 
household
 
through
 
access
 
to
 
credit.
  
Employing
 
a
 
gendered
 
lens,
 
the
 
study
 
utilised
 
rigorous
 
research
 
methodologies
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
Self-Help
 
Groups
 
(SHGs)
 
programs
 
and
 
institutional
 
support
 
for
 
women,
 
with
 
a
 
primary
 
goal
 
of
 
fostering
 
sustainable
 
livelihoods
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
inclusion.
 
The
 
study
 
employed
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
robust
 
methods
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
validity
 
and
 
reliability
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁndings,
 
and
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
program's
 
effectiveness.
 
A
 
central
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
was
 
on
 
studying
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
on
 
women's
 
empowerment,
 
aiming
 
to
 
uncover
 
nuanced
 
insights
 
into
 
how
 
access
 
to
 
credit
 
inﬂuences
 
gender
 
dynamics
 
within
 
households
 
and
 
contributes
 
to
 
the
 
broader
 
goal
 
of
 
empowering
 
women
 
economically
 
and
 
socially.
 
This
 
evaluation
 
will
 
provide
 
valuable
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
program's
 
effectiveness
 
from
 
a
 
gender
 
perspective,
 
contributing
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
inclusive
 
and
 
equitable
 
assessment
 
of
 
NRLP's
 
impact.
 
 
The
 
team
 
is
 
now
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
phase
 
of
 
evaluation
 
of
 
NRLP,
 
the
 
focus
 
is
 
speciﬁcally
 
directed
 
towards
 
assessing
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
women's
 
empowerment
 
within
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
livelihoods.
 
Employing
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
gender
 
lens,
 
the
 
evaluation
 
extends
 
beyond
 
examining
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
credit
 
and
 
ﬁnancial
 
inclusion,
 
delving
 
into
 
the
 
broader
 
spectrum
 
of

across
 
all

The
 
proposed
 
study,
 
implemented
 
by
 
[Client
 
Organization],
 
seeks
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
interventions
 
aimed
 
at
 
uplifting
 
the
 
ultra-poor
 
in
 
[Location],
 
under
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S

implemented
 
by
 
[Client
 
Organization]
 
seeks
 
to
 
improve
 
social,
 
economic,
 
and
 
gender-based
 
outcomes
 
of
 
the
 
“Ultra
 
Poor
 
Household''
 
through
 
the
 
evidence-based
 
graduation
 
approach.
 
[Client
 
Organization]
 
is
 
partnering
 
with
 
NRLM
 
and
 
respective
 
SRLMs
 
to
 
directly
 
implement
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
through
 
a
 
graduation
 
approach
 
in
 
the
 
states
 
of
 
[Location],
 
Rajasthan,
 
Assam,
 
and
 
Tripura.
 
However,
 
[Client
 
Organization]
 
wants
 
to
 
conduct
 
an
 
evaluation
 
of
 
outcomes
 
from
 
a
 
gender
 
lens
 
for
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
only
 
in
 
[Location].
 
The
 
outputs
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
blueprint
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
graduation
 
approach
 
more
 
gender
 
intentional.
 
The
 
Ultra-Poor
 
(UP)
 
households
 
can
 
be
 
characterised
 
through
 
the
 
Venn

The
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
program
 
design
 
and
 
delivery
 
from
 
a
 
lens
 
of
 
gender
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
identifying
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
on
 
gender
 
but
 
also
 
to
 
recommend
 
what
 
can
 
be
 
redesigned/incorporated
 
to
 
amplify
 
the
 
current
 
program
 
outcomes
 
and
 
improve
 
program
 
sustainability.
 
3.2
 
Our
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
Project
 
The
 
program
 
focuses
 
on
 
highly
 
vulnerable
 
and
 
marginalised
 
groups,
 
including
 
particularly
 
vulnerable
 
tribal
 
groups
 
(PVTGs),
 
scheduled
 
tribes
 
(ST),
 
and
 
scheduled
 
castes
 
(SC),
 
who
 
are
 
socially
 
and
 
geographically
 
excluded,
 
lacking
 
land
 
and
 
productive
 
assets.
 
It
 
employs
 
a
 
sequential,
 
multifaceted
 
intervention
 
approach
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
graduation
 
model.
 
This
 
involves
 
meeting
 
basic
 
needs
 
by
 
providing
 
consumption
 
allowances,
 
creating
 
diversiﬁed
 
livelihood
 
plans
 
for
 
households,
 
and
 
offering
 
grants
 
for
 
asset
 
creation
 
and
 
training
 
in
 
technical
 
skills.
 
Social
 
empowerment
 
is
 
fostered
 
through
 
ongoing
 
skill
 
development,
 
coaching,
 
and
 
support
 
for
 
micro-enterprises.
 
Financial
 
support
 
is
 
provided
 
through
 
the
 
formation
 
of
 
women-based
 
Self-Help
 
Groups
 
(SHGs)
 
to
 
encourage
 
savings
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
credit.
 
The
 
program
 
primarily
 
targets
 
women,
 
aiming
 
to
 
bring
 
positive
 
change
 
to
 
their
 
families.
 
The
 
programme
 
objectives
 
also
 
include
 
“
while
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
didis
 
are
 
neither
 
socially
 
nor
 
ﬁnancially
 
excluded
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
program”.
 
and
 
the
 
delivery
 
model
 
puts
 
women
 
at
 
the
 
centre.
  
Program
 
objectives
 
emphasise
 
identifying
 
and
 
addressing
 
gender
 
inequalities,
 
gender-based
 
constraints,
 
and
 
inequitable
 
norms

dynamics,
 
and
 
taking
 
steps
 
to
 
address
 
them.
 
To
 
enhance
 
gender
 
intentionality,
 
the
 
program
 
seeks
 
to
 
address
 
gender
 
inequalities
 
and
 
norms,
 
making
 
the
 
overall
 
approach
 
more
 
inclusive
 
and
 
equitable.
 
The
 
implementation
 
phase
 
involves
 
a
 
gender-focused
 
study
 
to
 
inform
 
a
 
gender-transformative
 
evaluation
 
design
 
for
 
the
 
program's
 
continuous
 
improvement.
 
Hence
 
a
 
gender-transformative
 
evaluation
 
design
 
is
 
needed
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
iterative
 
in
 
nature
 
&amp;
 
‘formative’
 
more
 
than
 
a
 
summative
 
evaluation.
 
 
In
 
order
 
to
 
carry
 
out
 
a
 
robust
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S

following
 
sets
 
of
 
assumptions
 
needs
 
to
 
hold
 
true.
 
 
 
Assumption
 
1:
 
A
 
detailed
 
sample
 
universe
 
for
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
in
 
[Location]
 
is
 
available,
 
allowing
 
for
 
a

Assumption
 
3:
 
A
 
detailed
 
program
 
timeline
 
for
 
the
 
implementation
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
is
 
established,
 
aligned

Assumption
 
4:
 
The
 
UPAJ
 
Project
 
is
 
considered
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
[Client’s

program,
 
indicating
 
continuity
 
in
 
geography
 
and
 
stakeholders
 
involved
 
in
 
[Location].
 
3.3
 
Technical
 
Approach
 
and
 
Methodology
 
3.3.1.
 
Study
 
Approach
 
This
 
evaluation
 
aims
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
programme's
 
design
 
and
 
implementation
 
on
 
gender-based
 
outcomes,
 
while
 
also
 
developing
 
recommendations
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
program's
 
effectiveness,
 
and
 
future
 
sustainability.
 
To
 
this
 
end,
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
both
 
formative
,
 
i.e.,
 
contribute
 
to
 
design
 
and
 
implementation
 
iterations
 
at
 
multiple
 
stages,
 
and
 
summative
,
 
i.e.,
 
evaluate
 
the
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
deﬁned
 
programme
 
outcomes
 
at
 
regular
 
intervals.
 
The
 
ultimate
 
goal
 
of
 
the
 
initiative
 
is
 
to
 
enable
 
households
 
to
 
come
 
out
 
of
 
ultra
 
poverty,
 
while
 
placing
 
women
 
right
 
at
 
the
 
centre
 
of
 
its
 
delivery
 
model.
 
Women
 
of
 
these
 
households
 
(
didis
)
 
are
 
the
 
intended
 
drivers
 
of
 
the
 
change,
 
fostered
 
through
 
a
 
multifaceted
 
action
 
strategy
 
built
 
upon
 
t
he
 
graduation
 
approach
.
 
However,
 
to
 
ensure
 
gender
 
equity
 
and
 
long-term
 
impact
 
sustainability,
 
it
 
is
 
crucial
 
that
 
these
 
Didi's
 
go
 
beyond
 
being
 
mere
 
instruments
 
of
 
change
 
for
 
their
 
families
 
and
 
are
 
empowered
 
to
 
cultivate
 
agency
 
and
 
strive
 
for
 
an
 
improved
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
themselves
 
as
 
well.
 
Therefore,
 
it
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
employ
 
a
 
gendered
 
lens
 
in
 
the
 
re-examination
 
of
 
the
 
programmatic
 
theory
 
of
 
change,
 
intervention
 
design,
 
delivery
 
models
 
and
 
overall
 
impact.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
design
 
should
 
be
 
rooted
 
in
 
feminist
 
principles
2
,
 
while
 
also
 
being
 
mindful
 
of
 
the
 
existing
 
intersectionality
 
as
 
the
 
program
 
speciﬁcally
 
focuses
 
on
 
families
 
from
 
economically,
 
socially,
 
and
 
geographically
 
marginalised
 
communities.
 
The
 
proposed
 
study
 
approach
 
will
 
follow
 
the
 
core
 
tenets
 
of
 
feminist
 
and
 
gender-based
 
evaluations
,
 
including
 
but
 
not
 
limited

●
 
honesty
 
and
 
integrity:
 
including
 
understanding
 
the
 
potential
 
harm
 
the
 
evaluation
 
may
 
cause,
 
or
 
any
 
conﬂict
 
of
 
interest
 
inherent
 
in
 
the
 
evaluation
 
process
 
or
 
context.
 
●
 
respect
 
for
 
people:
 
using
 
both
 
participatory
 
methods
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
people
 
who
 
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
evaluation
 
receive
 
feedback
 
about
 
it
 
and
 
beneﬁt
 
from
 
it
 
●
 
be
 
transformative:
 
with
 
opportunities
 
for
 
reﬂection

for
 
all
 
stakeholders
 
and
 
actors,
 
including
 
our

(evaluators)
 
●
 
be

by
 
ensuring
 
that

of
 
the
 
less
 
privileged
 
are
 
heard.
 
●
 
be
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
principle
 
of
 
mutuality:
  
not
 
‘extracting’
 
information,
 
but
 
also
 
‘giving
 
back’
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
sharing
 
-
 
analysis
 
and
 
insights.
 
●
 
use
 
mixed
 
methods:
  
while
 
using
 
subjective,
 
feminist,
 
and
 
qualitative
 
methodologies,
 
which
 
respect
 
‘women’s
 
ways
 
of
 
knowing’,
 
and
 
knowledge
 
based
 
on
 
experience
 
and
 
insights
 
from
 
implementation,
 
along
 
with
 
traditional
 
quantitative
 
methods
 
favoured
 
for
 
establishing
 
contribution/attribution
 
on
 
impact.
 
●
 
prioritise
 
the
 
assessment
 
of
 
changes
 
in
 
gender
 
power.
 
●
 
generate
 
broader

of,
 
for
 
example,
 
women’s
 
health,

justice
 
and
 
so
 
on.
 
We
 
intend
 
to
 
embed
 
these
 
principles
 
throughout
 
the
 
three-year
 
evaluation
 
process
 
and
 
aim
 
to

At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
stage,
 
we
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
more
 
thorough
 
understanding

the

behind

more

Logical
 
Fram ew ork
 
The
 
logical
 
framework
,
 
or
 
log
 
frame,
 
has
 
established
 
the
 
logical
 
linkages
 
connecting
 
the
 
[Client’s
 
Program]
 
programme’s 
 
means
 
(inputs
 
and
 
activities)
 
with
 
its
 
ends
 
(outputs
 
and
 
outcomes),
 
and
 
their
 
means
 
of
 
veriﬁcation
 
(tools
 
and
 
indicators).
 
It
 
details
 
short
 
term
 
outputs,
 
intermediate
 
and
 
long-term
 
outcomes,
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
indicative
 
metrics
 
/
 
indicators.
 
It
 
will
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
main
 
summary
 
of
 
the
 
project,
 
and
 
used
 
for
 
planning,
 
implementation,
 
and
 
subsequently
 
used
 
to
 
design
 
the
 
overall
 
monitoring
 
and
 
evaluation
 
framework.
 
To
 
facilitate
 
gender
 
transformative
 
implementation
 
and
 
evaluation,
 
it
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
engender
 
it
 
using
 
iterative
 
and
 
participatory
 
processes
 
(with
 
programme
 
team,
 
implementation
 
partners,
 
gender
 
experts,
 
community
 
leaders,
 
and
 
beneﬁciary
 
groups. 
 
 
The
 
engendering
 
process
 
seeks
 
to
 
recognise
 
and
 
address
 
gender
 
inequities
 
speciﬁc
 
to
 
Didis
,
 
both
 
within
 
and
 
outside
 
their
 
households.
 
This
 
involves
 
integrating
 
an
 
understanding
 
of
 
social
 
and
 
gender
 
relations
 
into
 
the
 
project
 
implementation.
 
By
 
adopting
 
a
 
gendered
 
perspective,
 
we
 
will
 
examine
 
the
 
socially
 
constructed
 
disparities,
 
such
 
as
 
norms
 
and
 
access
 
barriers,
 
between
 
Didis
 
and
 
their
 
male
 
household
 
members,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
among
 
Didis
 
from
 
various
 
communities.
 
These
 
distinctions
 
play
 
a
 
crucial
 
role
 
in
 
determining
 
the
 
extent
 
to
 
which
 
women
 
face
 
limitations
 
in
 
accessing
 
and
 
controlling
 
resources,
 
experience
 
varied
 
constraints
 
and
 
opportunities
 
in
 
society,
 
whether
 
at
 
the
 
household,
 
community,
 
or
 
state
 
level
 
-
 
ultimately
 
impacting
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
realise
 
the
 
beneﬁts
 
(outcomes)
 
through
 
participating
 
in
 
programme’s
 
activities.
 
 
As
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
step,
 
the
 
log
 
frame
 
will
 
be
 
engendered
 
by
 
reﬂecting
 
on
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
questions
 
across
 
each
 
element
 
of
 
its

-
 
long

be
 
to
 
deepen

listen
 
to
 
their
 
experiences
 
coming
 
from

also
 
allow
 
us
 
the
 
opportunity
 
for
 
clariﬁcations,

get
 
more

if
 
required.
 
These
 
ﬁeld

will
 
be
 
mainly
 
conducted
 
in
 
the

with
 
some

beneﬁciaries.
 
The
 
goal
 
will
 
be
 
to
 
engage

from
 
them
 
to
 
broadly
 
assess

the

on
 
their

well-being,
 
identify

-
 
and
 
draw
 
out

crucial
 
to
 
initiate
 
the

in-depth
 
interviews
 
(IDIs)

conducted
 
with
 
both

mixed
 
groups
 
(for

.
 
This
 
is

it
 
helps
 
us
 
gauge
 
comprehension,
 
cultural-gender

of
 
the
 
core

accompanied
 
by

all,
 
of
 
these
 
tools
 
will
 
be
 
participatory
 
in
 
nature.
 
We
 
intend
 
to
 
utilise
 
participatory
 
evaluation
 
tools
 
such
 
as
 
Economic
 
Ranking
 
of
 
Households,
 
Asset
 
Ownership
 
Mapping,
 
Decision

.
 
to
 
grasp
 
their
 
perception
 
of
 
economic
 
mobility,
 
ownership
 
of

and
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
make
 
decisions
 
related
 
to
 
livelihoods,
 
income,
 
and
 
expenditure.
 
These
 
insights
 
are
 
essential
 
for
 
a
 
comprehensive

Building
 
on
 
the
 
learnings
 
from
 
primary
 
and
 
secondary
 
review
 
conducted
 
in
 
the
 
preceding

we
 
will

the

of
 
the

The

will
 
be

by
 
researchers
 
trained
 
in

such
 
as
 
National
 
Rural

with
 
particular
 
focus
 
on

The
 
overall
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
of
 
the

will
 
draw
 
from
 
multiple
 
existing

bringing
 
together
 
constructs
 
most
 
relevant
 
to
 
assessing
 
various
 
lines
 
of
 
enquiry
 
emerging
 
from
 
key

We’ll
 
also
 
include
 
fundamental
 
gender
 
analysis
 
concepts
 
in
 
both
 
evaluation
 
and

such
 
as:
 
●
 
Gender

division
 
of
 
labour.
 
●
 
Gender
 
based
 
access,
 
ownership,
 
and
 
control
 
over

●
 
Gender

making;
 
&amp;
 
●
 
Empowerment
 
across

Through
 
these

We’ll
 
also
 
assess
 
the
 
programmatic
 
impact
 
using
 
the
 
revised
 
OECD-DAC
 
criteria
6
,
 
engendered
7
 
in
 
the
 
programme
 
context.
 
The
 
criteria
 
for
 
assessment
 
covers:
 
●
 
Relevance:
 
To
 
what
 
extent
 
are
 
the
 
intervention
 
objectives
 
and
 
design
 
responding
 
to
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
beneﬁciaries?
 
Do
 
they
 
also
 
recognise
 
&amp;
 
address
 
the
 
speciﬁc
 
needs
 
of
 
women
 
beneﬁciaries?
 
●
 
Effectiveness:
 
To
 
what
 
extent
 
has
 
the
 
intervention
 
achieved,
 
or
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
achieve,
 
its
 
objectives,
 
and
 
its
 
results,
 
including
 
any
 
differential
 
results
 
across
 
groups?
 
What
 
can
 
be
 
the
 
underlying
 
cause
 
for
 
differential
 
impact?
 
●
 
Efﬁciency:
 
To
 
what
 
extent
 
does
 
the
 
intervention
 
deliver,
 
or
 
is
 
likely
 
to
 
deliver,
 
results
 
in
 
an
 
economic
 
and
 
timely
 
way?
 
 
●
 
Impact:
 
To
 
what
 
extent
 
has
 
the
 
intervention
 
generated
 
or
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
generate
 
signiﬁcant
 
positive
 
or
 
negative,
 
intended,
 
or
 
unintended,
 
higher-level
 
effects?
  
Is
 
this
 
impact
 
equitable
 
across
 
gender
 
and
 
caste
 
groups
 
(and
 
their
 
intersectionality),
 
or
 
are
 
there
 
any
 
structural/design
 
gaps
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
same?
 
●
 
Sustainability:
 
To
 
what
 
extent
 
will
 
the
 
net
 
beneﬁts
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
continue,
 
or
 
are
 
likely
 
to
 
continue?
 
Are
 
the
 
programme
 
activities
 
contributing
 
to
 
shifts
 
in
 
gender
 
power
 
dynamics
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
change
 
sustainable
 
for
 
women?
 
●
 
Coherence:
 
How
 
well
 
does
 
the
 
intervention
 
ﬁt
 
with
 
other
 
interventions
 
in
 
the
 
country,
 
sector,
 
or
 
institution?
 
Is
 
there
 
internal
 
coherence
 
within
 
programme
 
interventions,
 
and
 
external
 
coherence
 
with
 
other
 
systemic
 
and
 
institutional
 
efforts
 
towards
 
gender
 
equity?

to
 
investigate
 
evaluation
 
questions
 
in
 
tandem
 
with
 
the

(month
 
6),
 
periodic

(month
 
12-30)
 
and
 
endline
 
evaluation
 
(month
 
34-35).
 
All
 
the
 
three
 
components
 
will
 
follow
 
a
 
non-experimental
 
mixed-method
 
design
 
collecting
 
longitudinal

along
 
with
 
the
 
comprehensive

other
 
quantitative

in
 
combination
 
with
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
review
 
of

documents
 
(annual
 
reports,
 
results
 
framework,
 
annual
 
reports,

will
 
give
 
us
 
a
 
strong
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
effectiveness,
 
efﬁciency,
 
and
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
The
 
survey
 
data
 
across
 
various
 
phases
 
of
 
evaluation
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
change
 
in

of
 
Ultra-Poor
 
HHs
 
in
 
the
 
areas:
 
income,
 
expenditures,

The
 
detailed
 
outcome
 
indicator
 
list
 
(as
 
per

for
 
3-year-long
 
carefully
 
sequenced
 
interventions
 
under
 
[CLIENT’S

attached
 
in
 
Annexure
 
1.
 
We
 
propose
 
a

for
 
the

while
 
not

We
 
also
 
propose
 
that

3.3.2
 
Evaluation
 
Design
 
&amp;
 
Sampling
 
To
 
assess
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
a
 
program
 
on
 
various
 
target
 
indicators,
 
such
 
as
 
output,
 
outcome,
 
and
 
impact
 
indicators,
 
two
 
identiﬁcation
 
strategies
 
can
 
be
 
employed
 
to
 
establish
 
causal
 
linkages.
 
Each
 
method
 
contributes
 
validity
 
to
 
the
 
results,
 
but
 
the
 
extent
 
varies
 
under
 
speciﬁc
 
circumstances.
 
The
 
most
 
rigorous
 
approach
 
for
 
evaluating
 
and
 
attributing
 
the
 
program's
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
elicited
 
outcome
 
is
 
through
 
Experimental
 
Design,
 
speciﬁcally
 
a
 
Randomized
 
Control
 
Trial
 
(RCT).
 
However,
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
assignment,
 
the
 
program
 
implementation
 
began
 
in
 
December
 
2023/January
 
2024,
 
with
 
the
 
purposeful
 
selection
 
of
 
intervention
 
districts,
 
blocks,
 
and
 
villages
 
based
 
on
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]'s
 
assessment
 
in
 
[Location].
 
This
 
precludes
 
any
 
opportunity
 
for
 
random
 
allocation
 
of
 
villages
 
or
 
women
 
to
 
the
 
intervention,
 
making
 
it
 
impractical
 
to
 
utilize
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
experimental
 
design
 
in
 
this
 
context.
 
The
 
constraints
 
arise
 
from
 
the
 
inability
 
to
 
implement
 
random
 
selection
 
and
 
assignment,
 
limiting
 
the
 
feasibility
 
of
 
employing
 
experimental
 
design
 
in
 
this
 
speciﬁc
 
scenario.
 
Consequently,
 
we
 
suggest
 
the
 
following
 
approaches,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
ﬁnalized
 
contingent
 
upon
 
data
 
availability
 
and
 
mutual
 
agreement.
 
The
 
methodologies
 
outlined
 
below
 
are
 
informed
 
by
 
our
 
interpretation
 
of
 
the
 
RFP,
 
the
 
information
 
currently
 
at
 
our
 
disposal,
 
and
 
initial
 
discussions
 
with
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
team.
 
As
 
for
 
the
 
budget,
 
we
 
have
 
assumed
 
that
 
sampling
 
can
 
be
 
executed
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
allowing
 
for
 
the
 
proposal
 
and
 
implementation
 
of
 
either
 
methodology
 
within
 
the
 
conﬁnes
 
of
 
the
 
existing
 
budget.
 
Quantitative
 
Approach
 
1:
 
Non-Experimental
 
Design
 
(Pre-Post
 
Tests)
 
The
 
feasibility
 
of
 
evaluating
 
the
 
program's
 
impact
 
hinges
 
on
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
existing
 
data
 
concerning
 
its
 
beneﬁciaries
 
and
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
construct
 
credible
 
counterfactual
 
control
 
groups
 
using
 
econometric
 
techniques.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
obtaining
 
suitable
 
comparison
 
groups
 
in
 
a
 
quasi-experimental
 
design
 
proves
 
challenging
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
intervention's
 
nature
 
and
 
program
 
focus.
 
In
 
light
 
of
 
these
 
considerations,
 
we
 
recommend
 
adopting
 
a
 
pre-test
 
post-test
 
non-experimental
 
design,
 
where
 
selected
 
participants
 
represent
 
the
 
population
 
across
 
different
 
criteria.
 
This
 
design
 
allows
 
for
 
measurement
 
before
 
and
 
after
 
treatment,
 
providing
 
insights
 
into
 
whether
 
beneﬁciaries
 
have
 
achieved
 
the
 
identiﬁed
 
outcomes.
 
However,
 
a
 
challenge
 
associated
 
with
 
this
 
approach
 
is
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
internal
 
validity,
 
given
 
the
 
observation
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
participants
 
over
 
time.
 
Drawing
 
on
 
our
 
experience,
 
a
 
thorough
 
examination
 
of
 
project
 
documents
 
(such
 
as
 
annual
 
reports,
 
results
 
frameworks,
 
Management
 
Information
 
System
 
(MIS)
 
data,
 
and
 
past
 
survey
 
data)
 
can
 
offer
 
a
 
robust
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
program's
 
effectiveness,
 
efﬁciency,
 
and
 
impact.
 
Combining
 
survey
 
data
 
with
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
review
 
of
 
quantitative
 
information
 
will
 
furnish
 
strong
 
evidence
 
and
 
insights
 
into
 
the
 
program's
 
effectiveness,
 
impact,
 
sustainability,
 
and
 
coherence
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
OECD-DAC
 
(REEISC)
 
framework.
 
The
 
team
 
will
 
employ
 
a
 
multi-phase
 
sampling
 
technique
 
while
 
selecting
 
the
 
districts,
 
blocks,
 
and
 
villages
 
in
 
[Location].
 
The
 
indicators
 
for
 
targeting
 
the
 
numbers
 
of
 
districts,
 
blocks,
 
and
 
villages
 
will
 
be
 
identiﬁed
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
T/NI
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
initial
 
ﬁeld
 
immersion
 
and
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
participants
 
by
 
CMS.
 
The
 
villages
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
selected
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
maturity/adoption

program
 
subject
 
to
 
availability
 
of
 
data
 
provided
 
by
 
T/NI.
 
The
 
identiﬁcation
 
of
 
targeted
 
districts,
 
blocks,
 
villages
 
will
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
sample
 
selected
 
at
 
various
 
phases
 
of
 
study
 
has
 
enough
 
variation
 
to
 
draw
 
insights
 
from
 
the
 
diversity
 
of
 
respondents.
 
 
The
 
tentative
 
sample
 
size
 
for
 
the
 
non-experimental
 
design
 
(ongoing
 
cohort)
 
is
 
approximately
 
600.
 
We
 
aim
 
to
 
track
 
all
 
program
 
participants
 
in
 
the
 
aforementioned
 
cohort
 
(9)
 
throughout
 
the
 
evaluation.
 
Considering,
 
the
 
cohort
 
size,
 
and
 
including
 
for
 
attrition
 
and
 
design
 
effects,
 
we
 
would
 
propose
 
to
 
sample
 
the
 
full
 
cohort
 
of
 
600
 
women.
 
Following
 
the
 
full
 
cohort
 
would
 
also
 
help
 
us
 
run
 
some
 
meaningful
 
advance
 
statistical
 
tests.
 
Quantitative
 
Approach
 
2:
 
Quasi
 
Experimental
 
(Difference-in-Difference
 
with
 
Matching)
 
This
 
approach
 
relies
 
on
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
a
 
control
 
group.
 
As
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
currently
 
underway
 
with
 
speciﬁc
 
cohort
 
(cohort
 
9),
 
this
 
cohort
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
in
 
our
 
approach.
 
Our
 
understanding
 
suggests
 
that
 
the
 
program
 
employs
 
selection
 
criteria
 
for
 
enrolment
 
or
 
planning
 
future
 
cohorts
 
within
 
the
 
same
 
state.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
team
 
intends
 
to
 
select
 
a
 
control
 
group
 
from
 
the
 
program
 
enrolment
 
data,
 
representing
 
individuals
 
who
 
would
 
have
 
been
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
cohort
 
sample
 
if
 
the
 
programme
 
participation
 
had
 
not
 
been
 
restricted.
 
This
 
would
 
also
 
include
 
the
 
variable
 
on
 
their
 
willingness
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
programme.
 
 
Alternatively,
 
if
 
plans
 
exist
 
for
 
future
 
cohorts,
 
the
 
control
 
group
 
will
 
be
 
selected
 
from
 
these.
 
The
 
control
 
group
 
of
 
target
 
women
 
will
 
be
 
matched
 
for
 
similar
 
socio-demographic
 
proﬁles,
 
age,
 
economic
 
conditions,
 
and
 
other
 
relevant
 
factors
 
to
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
 
 
Assuming
 
a
 
baseline
 
study
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
during
 
the
 
program
 
period,
 
we
 
propose
 
utilising
 
the
 
difference-in-differences
 
of
 
matched
 
pairs
 
to
 
assess
 
the
 
program's
 
impact
 
by
 
analysing
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
baseline
 
and
 
endline.
 
Matched
 
pairs
 
will
 
be
 
formed
 
based
 
on
 
pre-program
 
baseline
 
values
 
of
 
indicators
 
inﬂuencing
 
women's
 
participation,
 
such
 
as
 
education,
 
age,
 
family
 
size,
 
asset
 
holdings,
 
among
 
others.
 
Paired
 
women
 
from
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
groups
 
will
 
be
 
tracked
 
during
 
the
 
endline
 
and
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
valid
 
counterfactual
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
unit
 
undergoing
 
training
 
and
 
other
 
services
 
provided
 
by
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION].
 
The
 
difference-in-differences
 
method
 
leverages
 
two
 
levels
 
of
 
differences:
 
one
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
survey
 
time
 
(baseline
 
and
 
endline)
 
and
 
the
 
other
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
treatment
 
provided
 
by
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
team.
 
This
 
methodology
 
yields
 
program
 
effects
 
as
 
the
 
difference
 
in
 
outcomes
 
between
 
endline
 
and
 
baseline
 
surveys
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
group,
 
after
 
subtracting
 
the
 
same
 
difference
 
in
 
control
 
units.
 
The
 
counterfactual
 
or
 
control
 
group
 
for
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
will
 
be
 
formed
 
through
 
matching
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
random
 
treatment
 
allocation.
 
The
 
assumption
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
change
 
in
 
outcomes
 
in
 
treatment
 
units
 
would
 
have
 
been
 
identical
 
to
 
that
 
in
 
control
 
units
 
in
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
If
 
this
 
assumption
 
holds,
 
any
 
additional
 
change
 
in
 
outcomes
 
in
 
treatment
 
units
 
can
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
program.
 
The
 
baseline
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
program
 
team
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
match
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
groups
 
based
 
on
 
initial
 
outcome
 
variables
 
in
 
2024
 
(according
 
to
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
timeline)
 
and
 
variables
 
affecting
 
program
 
participation,
 
using
 
matching
 
algorithms.
 
However,
 
the
 
ﬁnal
 
methodology
 
will
 
be
 
developed
 
and
 
agreed
 
upon
 
based
 
on
 
available
 
information
 
and
 
discussions
 
with
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION].

In

Quantitative
 
Approach
 
3:
 
Case
 
control
 
Case
 
Control
 
is
 
a
 
retrospective
 
quantitative
 
methodology
 
which
 
ﬁrst
 
identiﬁes
 
cases
 
(groups)
 
with
 
different
 
levels
 
of
 
exposure,
 
and
 
then
 
studies
 
the
 
differences
 
in
 
contextual
 
factors
 
which
 
foster
 
or
 
inhibit
 
the
 
achievement
 
of
 
these
 
outcomes.
 
It
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
help
 
determine
 
if
 
an
 
exposure
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 
an
 
outcome.
 
 
 
The
 
goal
 
of
 
this
 
exercise
 
will
 
be
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
variability
 
and
 
variance
 
in
 
the
 
programme
 
exposure
 
and
 
intensity
 
and
 
investigate
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
programmatic
 
interventions
 
(asset
 
&amp;
 
cash
 
transfer;
 
hand
 
holding
 
&amp;
 
training;
 
creating
 
support
 
systems;
 
livelihood
 
planning;
 
facilitating
 
access)
 
have
 
on
 
the
 
long
 
term
 
goals
 
(improvement
 
in
 
nutrition
 
&amp;
 
health
 
outcomes,
 
improvements
 
in
 
income,
 
assets
 
and
 
savings;
 
improved
 
social
 
inclusion
 
and
 
protection-
 
particularly
 
for
 
Didis),
 
that
 
is,
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
odds
 
that
 
the
 
delivery
 
of
 
interventions
 
will
 
lead
 
to
 
graduation
 
(as
 
envisioned
 
in
 
the
 
programmatic
 
theory
 
of
 
change?).
 
 
 
To
 
this
 
end,
 
our
 
ﬁrst
 
step
 
would
 
be
 
identiﬁcation
 
and
 
creation
 
of
 
groups
 
with
 
different
 
levels
 
of
 
exposure
 
to
 
these
 
activities,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
both
 
intensity
 
and
 
ﬁdelity;
 
and
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
change
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
deﬁned
 
intermediate/long
 
term
 
outcomes.
 
These
 
categories
 
will
 
be
 
created
 
through
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
MIS
 
and
 
other
 
process
 
monitoring
 
data
 
to
 
investigate
 
the
 
differential
 
results
 
in
 
terms
 
of:
 
 
1.
 
Fidelity
:
 
How
 
well
 
did
 
the
 
implementation/delivery
 
follow
 
the
 
protocols,
 
timelines
 
and
 
workplan
 
across
 
beneﬁciaries?
 
2.
 
Intensity:
 
What
 
was
 
the
 
frequency,
 
duration,
 
and
 
engagement
 
in
 
these
 
programmatic
 
activities?
 
 
In
 
this
 
context,
 
exposure
 
to
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
programme
 
is
 
looked
 
at
 
from
 
the
 
lens
 
as
 
intensity
 
of
 
the
 
programme
 
delivery.
 
Case
 
refers
 
to
 
instances
 
where
 
the
 
outcome
 
was
 
observed
 
and
 
control
 
where
 
the
 
outcome
 
was
 
not.
 
The
 
below
 
matrix
 
is
 
prepared
 
to
 
represent
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
units
 
following
 
under
 
all
 
combinations
 
of
 
case/control
 
and
 
exposure/no
 
exposure. The
 
deﬁnition
 
of
 
exposure
 
and
 
beneﬁt
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
clearly
 
deﬁned
 
(it
 
could
 
also
 
be
 
a
 
composite
 
index).
 
 
 
Exposure

The

ratio
 
is
 
calculated
 
as
 
follows
 
(a*d
 
/
 
b*c)
 
which
 
shows
 
the
 
increase/decrease
 
in
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
reaching
 
the
 
outcomes.

Differential
 
intensity
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
will
 
be
 
crucial
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
develop
 
a
 
case
 
and
 
a
 
control
 
group.
 
Similarly,
 
realisation
 
of
 
beneﬁts
 
across
 
both
 
groups
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
bring
 
balance
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
control
 
matrix.
 
The
 
distribution
 
of
 
the
 
population
 
under
 
each
 
quadrant
 
of
 
the
 
case
 
control
 
matrix
 
should
 
be
 
well
 
balanced
 
to
 
derive
 
the
 
best
 
results
 
out
 
of
 
this
 
approach. However,
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
the
 
differential
 
outcomes
 
and
 
exposure
 
do
 
not
 
always
 
ensure
 
the
 
applicability
 
of
 
this
 
approach,
 
these
 
should
 
be
 
observable
 
and
 
measurable
 
by
 
research
 
for
 
this
 
method
 
to
 
be
 
employed.
 
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
collected
 
data
 
and
 
distribution
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
across
 
the
 
2*2
 
matrix
 
of
 
beneﬁt
 
and
 
exposure,
 
the
 
odds
 
ratio
 
is
 
calculated.
 
Odds
 
ratio
 
indicates
 
the
 
probability
 
of
 
realising
 
outcomes
 
given
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
exposed
 
to
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
programme.
 
 
Through
 
this
 
approach,
 
we
 
would
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
better
 
understand
 
the
 
differential
 
level
 
of
 
impact
 
and
 
variability
 
within
 
the
 
programme,
 
the
 
reasons
 
(causes)
 
behind
 
them,
 
and
 
determine
 
what
 
additional
 
support
 
can
 
be
 
added
 
to
 
the
 
programme
 
design
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
and
 
impact
 
of
 
its
 
activities.
 
 
We
 
would
 
propose
 
to
 
survey
 
the
 
full
 
cohort
 
of
 
600
 
for
 
the
 
case
 
control
 
method.
 
This
 
would
 
be
 
done
 
at
 
endline.
 
Qualitative
 
approach
 
Given
 
the
 
complex,
 
multidimensional
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
program
 
and
 
gender
 
sensitivities
 
involved,
 
a
 
qualitative
 
method
 
is
 
being
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
design
 
to
 
deepen
 
understanding
 
of
 
women’s
 
views
 
and
 
experiences,
 
their
 
relationship
 
to
 
the
 
program’s
 
theory
 
of
 
change
 
and
 
the
 
nuances
 
of
 
gender-transformative
 
changes.
  
 
 
Evaluations
 
combining
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
methodologies
 
are
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
‘mixed
 
methods.
 
From
 
the
 
multiple
 
schema
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
categorising
 
mixed
 
methods,
 
we
 
propose
 
adopting
 
a
 
‘Sequential
 
Connecting
 
Strategy’. 
 
This
 
approach
 
comprises
 
of
 
one
 
method
 
being
 
applied
 
sequentially
 
after
 
the
 
other,
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
from
 
each
 
method
 
connecting
 
to
 
the
 
next.
 
The
 
primary
 
(quantitative)
 
method
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
by
 
the
 
secondary
 
(qualitative)
 
method.
 
 
 
Sequential
 
models
 
are
 
preferred,
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
sufﬁcient
 
time
 
to
 
conduct
 
more
 
than
 
one
 
round
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
survey,
 
because
 
they
 
make
 
it
 
possible
 
for
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
one
 
method
 
to
 
inform
 
the
 
other.
 
In
 
this
 
evaluation
 
the
 
main
 
evaluation
 
questions
 
will
 
be
 
answered
 
by
 
the
 
quantitative
 
method
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
method
 
will
 
be
 
employed
 
for
 
complementarity
 
(elaboration,
 
enhancement,
 
illustration,
 
and
 
clariﬁcation
 
of
 
the
 
results
 
from
 
the
 
quantitative
 
method),
 
focusing
 
on
 
developing
 
insights
 
into
 
ﬁndings
 
that
 
need
 
greater
 
exploration.
 
 
 
While
 
the
 
quantitative
 
study
 
will
 
provide
 
data
 
and
 
analysis
 
related
 
to
 
the
 
extent
 
of
 
impact
 
and
 
its
 
attributability
 
(if
 
quasi
 
experimental
 
approach
 
is
 
followed),
 
the
 
qualitative
 
design
 
provides
 
‘in-depth’
 
information
 
on
 
‘why’
 
and
 
‘how’
 
of
 
the
 
changes.
 
 
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
development
 
purpose,
 
where
 
the
 
quantitative
 
method
 
ﬁndings
 
will
 
be

Overall,
 
20
 
FGDs
 
and
 
45
 
qualitative
 
interviews
 
in
 
total
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
at
 
baseline,
 
and
 
endline,
 
each.
 
The
 
details
 
of
 
stakeholder
 
wise
 
and
 
cohort
 
wise
 
break-up
 
can
 
be
 
decided
 
at
 
a
 
later
 
stage.
 
 
 
This
 
integrated
 
approach
 
(quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
analysis)
 
aligns
 
with
 
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
conducting
 
a
 
thorough
 
gender-sensitive
 
evaluation,
 
providing
 
actionable
 
recommendations
 
for
 
the
 
program's
 
reﬁnement
 
and
 
expansion/scale.
 
This
 
will
 
produce
 
a
 
credible,
 
evidence-based
 
narrative
 
of
 
contribution
 
to
 
the
 
intervention.
 
Further,
 
the
 
proposed
 
evaluations
 
prioritise
 
a
 
shift
 
from
 
attributing
 
roles
 
based
 
on
 
gender
 
to
 
valuing
 
and
 
recognizing
 
the
 
diverse
 
and
 
meaningful
 
contributions
 
of
 
individuals
 
such
 
as
 
in
 
empowerment,
 
agency,
 
inclusion,
 
respecting
 
individual
 
identities
 
etc.
 
This
 
not
 
only
 
aligns
 
with
 
principles
 
of
 
equality
 
and
 
justice
 
but
 
also
 
fosters
 
a
 
more
 
inclusive
 
and
 
empowering
 
evaluation
 
framework.
 
 
Quantitative
 
surveys
 
with
 
50
 
households
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
each
 
period
 
assessment.
 
Qualitative
 
interviews
 
and
 
FGDs
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
conducted
 
women
 
with
 
the
 
earlier
 
cohorts,
 
who
 
have
 
graduated
 
for
 
understanding
 
differential
 
impact
 
and
 
nuances
 
in
 
programme.
 
These
 
could
 
be
 
conducted
 
during
 
periodic
 
assessments
 
where
 
we
 
propose
 
8
 
FGDs
 
and
 
15
 
IDIs
 
to
 
be
 
conducted
 
in
 
each
 
round.
 
These
 
are
 
indicative
 
numbers
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
detailed
 
out
 
at
 
a
 
later
 
stage.
 
 
 
Both
 
the
 
quantitative
 
surveys
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
interviews
 
and
 
explorations
 
will
 
be
 
new
 
in
 
each

to
 
cover/reach
 
a

Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
step
 
that
 
directly
 
inﬂuences
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
our
 
analyses.
 
We
 
follow
 
a
 
careful
 
and
 
thorough
 
approach,
 
addressing
 
issues
 
like
 
checking
 
ID
 
variables,
 
tagging
 
outliers,
 
handling
 
missing
 
values,
 
and
 
ﬁxing
 
logical
 
inconsistencies
 
in
 
real-time.
 
We
 
document
 
any
 
irregularities
 
and
 
corrections,
 
making
 
changes
 
only
 
after
 
discussing
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
considering
 
qualitative
 
insights.
 
After
 
collecting
 
any
 
set
 
of
 
data,
 
our
 
team
 
will
 
carry
 
out
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
process
 
that
 
includes
 
cleaning,
 
preparing,
 
and
 
storing
 
the
 
data.
 
We
 
have
 
a
 
dedicated
 
team
 
of
 
data
 
experts
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
dedicated
 
to
 
reﬁning
 
all
 
data
 
related
 
processes.
 
During
 
the
 
analysis
 
phase,
 
we'll
 
closely
 
examine
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
data,
 
have
 
reﬂective
 
sessions
 
with
 
our
 
internal
 
team,
 
and
 
discuss
 
ﬁndings
 
with
 
the
 
project
 
team.
 
Following
 
data
 
cleaning,
 
our
 
analysis
 
team
 
will
 
lead
 
the
 
analysis
 
in
 
STATA
 
or

based
 
on
 
agreed
 
speciﬁcations.
 
A
 
set
 
of
 
these
 
protocols
 
–
 
for
 
cleaning,
 
management
 
and
 
analysis
 
will
 
be
 
documented
 
post
 
deﬁning
 
the
 
analytical
 
framework.
 
Qualitative
 
Analysis
 
The
 
study
 
will
 
analyse
 
the
 
qualitative
 
data
 
collected
 
through
 
the
 
FGDs,
 
IDIs
 
and
 
KIIs
 
using
 
qualitative
 
software
 
such
 
as
 
Nvivo
 
or
 
Atlas.ti,
 
using
 
the
 
following
 
analytical
 
techniques
 
Narrative
 
Analysis
:
 
As
 
the
 
IDI
 
with
 
UP
 
households
 
aims
 
to
 
capture
 
their
 
personal
 
experience
 
through
 
stories
 
and
 
relevant
 
instances,
 
on
 
skill
 
development,
 
livelihood
 
enhancement,
 
and
 
overall
 
perceptions.
 
Narrative
 
analysis
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
how
 
people
 
expressed
 
their
 
feelings
 
and
 
what
 
language
 
they
 
used
 
while
 
describing
 
their
 
experiences.
 
Thematic
 
Analysis
:
 
The
 
IDI
 
conducted
 
with
 
the
 
operation
 
teams
 
and
 
CBO
 
Leaders
 
will
 
provide
 
better
 
understanding
 
and
 
insights
 
into
 
programme
 
planning
 
and
 
implementation
 
and
 
further
 
the
 
progress,
 
operational
 
challenges,
 
and
 
subsequent
 
course
 
corrections.
 
A
 
thematic
 
analysis
 
will
 
help
 
identify
 
the
 
key
 
themes
 
for
 
systemic
 
understanding
 
which
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
known
 
earlier.
 
Whereas
 
the
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
FGDs,
 
will
 
be
 
analysed
 
through
 
both
 
content
 
analysis
 
and
 
thematic
 
analysis.
 
Together
 
they
 
will
 
help
 
in
 
identifying
 
the
 
key
 
factors
 
that
 
beneﬁtted/
 
not-
 
beneﬁted
 
the
 
UP

in
 
terms

To
 
obtain
 
meaningful
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
analysis
 
outlined
 
in
 
the
 
provided
 
text,
 
we
 
will
 
break
 
down
 
the
 
process
 
in
 
the
 
following
 
steps:
 
1.
 
Preprocessing
 
and
 
Data
 
Cleaning
:
 
We
 
will
 
begin
 
by
 
preparing
 
the
 
textual
 
data
 
for
 
analysis.
 
This
 
initial
 
step
 
will
 
involve
 
tasks
 
such
 
as
 
text
 
cleaning,
 
removal
 
of
 
stop
 
words,
 
and
 
word
 
stemming.
 
The
 
objective
 
will
 
be
 
to
 
enhance
 
data
 
quality
 
and
 
reduce
 
noise.
 
2.
 
Summarization
 
and
 
Concept
 
Identiﬁcation:
 
After
 
preprocessing,
 
we
 
will
 
generate
 
a
 
concise
 
document
 
summary.
 
This
 
summary
 
will
 
aid
 
in
 
identifying
 
key
 
concepts,
 
outcomes,
 
and
 
causal
 
links
 
within
 
the
 
text.
 
The
 
subsequent
 
task
 
will
 
involve
 
identifying
 
essential
 
entities,
 
ideas,
 
or
 
keywords
 
using
 
techniques
 
like
 
Named
 
Entity
 
Recognition
 
(NER)
 
or
 
keyword
 
extraction.
 
3.
 
Broad
 
Theme
 
Extraction
 
and
 
Clustering
:
 
We
 
will
 
expand
 
our
 
analysis
 
to
 
encompass
 
broad
 
themes.
 
We
 
will
 
group
 
related
 
concepts
 
into
 
thematic
 
clusters.
 
This
 
step
 
will
 
provide
 
a
 
higher-level
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
text's
 
content.
 
4.
 
Causal
 
Relation
 
Identiﬁcation
 
and
 
Mapping
:
 
At
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
analysis,
 
there
 
will
 
lie
 
the
 
identiﬁcation
 
of
 
causal
 
relations.
 
We
 
will
 
recognize
 
sentences
 
expressing
 
these
 
relationships,
 
like
 
&quot;X
 
leads
 
to
 
Y&quot;
 
or
 
&quot;A
 
causes
 
B.&quot;
 
Then,
 
we
 
will
 
create
 
a
 
causal
 
map,
 
portraying
 
these
 
causal
 
relationships
 
as
 
a
 
network,
 
where
 
concepts
 
will
 
serve
 
as
 
nodes
 
and
 
causal
 
links
 
as
 
edges.
 
We
 
will
 
distinguish
 
between
 
causal
 
conditions
 
(factors
 
leading
 
to
 
change)
 
and
 
outcomes
 
(results
 
of
 
these
 
conditions)
 
to
 
clarify
 
cause-and-effect
 
associations.
 
5.
 
Formalization
 
and
 
Interpretation
 
of
 
relationships:
 
To
 
formalise
 
the
 
relationships,
 
we
 
will
 
employ
 
set
 
theory
 
by
 
deﬁning
 
sets
 
for
 
causal
 
conditions
 
and
 
outcomes.
 
For
 
example,
 
we
 
will
 
use
 
&quot;C&quot;
 
for
 
causal
 
conditions
 
and
 
&quot;O&quot;
 
for
 
outcomes.
 
We
 
will
 
deﬁne
 
relations
 
within
 
these
 
sets
 
to
 
illustrate
 
how
 
conditions
 
inﬂuence
 
outcomes,
 
potentially
 
using
 
arrows
 
or
 
mathematical
 
symbols.
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
visualise
 
the
 
causal
 
map
 
for
 
improved
 
comprehension.
 
This
 
structured
 
framework
 
will
 
provide
 
a
 
systematic
 
approach
 
to
 
extract
 
meaningful
 
information
 
from
 
text,
 
helping
 
answer
 
the
 
identiﬁed
 
research
 
questions
 
and
 
evaluate
 
the
 
broad
 
themes.

Training
 
CMS
 
has
 
an
 
expert
 
network
 
of
 
senior
 
enumerators
 
with
 
strong
 
domain
 
knowledge
 
and
 
experience
 
of
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
sector.
 
They
 
are
 
also
 
trained
 
on
 
research
 
ethics
 
and
 
the
 
collection
 
of
 
sensitive
 
information,
 
etc.
 
The
 
selection
 
of
 
enumerators
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
stringent
 
measures,
 
and
 
they
 
are
 
assessed
 
for
 
quality
 
throughout
 
the
 
project.
 
Quality
 
Researchers/Enumerators
 
will
 
be
 
selected
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
following
 
criteria:
 
1.
 
Locally
 
Sourced:
 
CMS
 
will
 
ensure
 
that
 
100%
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
researchers
 
selected
 
are
 
local
 
in
 
nature.
 
They
 
know
 
the
 
language,
 
dialect,
 
customs,
 
and
 
culture.
 
They
 
also
 
easily
 
understand
 
the
 
local
 
terminologies
 
used,
 
giving
 
them
 
a
 
stronger
 
connection
 
and
 
rapport
 
between
 
researcher
 
and
 
Respondents.
 
2.
 
Ethically
 
certiﬁed
 
and
 
Experienced:
 
Field
 
protocol
 
of
 
CMS
 
ensures
 
that
 
ﬁeld
 
researchers
 
have
 
completed
 
the
 
certiﬁcation
 
of
 
“Research
 
Ethics''
 
from
 
either
 
UNICEF-Agora
 
or
 
Citi
 
or
 
FHI360.
 
The
 
researchers
 
selected
 
will
 
undergo
 
various
 
webinars,
 
discussions,
 
training
 
on
 
gender
 
sensitivity
 
&amp;
 
various
 
research
 
and
 
ﬁeld-related
 
topics.
 
Only
 
certiﬁed
 
enumerators
 
with
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
2
 
years
 
of
 
experience
 
will
 
be
 
recruited.
 
 
3.
 
Gender
 
Balance:
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
study,
 
CMS
 
will
 
ensure
 
a
 
balance
 
of
 
male
 
and
 
female
 
enumerators
 
to
 
suit
 
the
 
study
 
topic
 
and
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
respondents.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
respondents
 
are
 
primarily
 
females
 
for
 
the
 
[CLIENT’S
 
PROGRAM]
 
study,
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
male
 
and
 
female
 
enumerators
 
will
 
be
 
hired
 
based
 
on
 
experience
 
and
 
ease
 
of
 
communication
 
with
 
the
 
SHG
 
members.
 
.
 
The
 
team
 
of
 
supervisors
 
for
 
this
 
study
 
is
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
males
 
and
 
female
 
supervisors.
 
The
 
supervisor
 
will
 
shufﬂe
 
the
 
team
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
ground
 
requirement.
 
In
 
this
 
study,
 
prior
 
experience
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
SHGs,
 
Aajeevika,
 
or
 
NRLM
 
Projects
 
will
 
be
 
preferred.
 
 
4.
 
Tested
 
and
 
veriﬁed:
 
CMS
 
does
 
a
 
thorough
 
internal
 
veriﬁcation
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
staff,
 
their
 
nature,
 
probing
 
skills
 
with
 
projects.
 
Those
 
who
 
are
 
certiﬁed
 
for
 
research
 
ethics
 
in
 
earlier
 
studies
 
or
 
have
 
strong
 
references
 
by
 
CMS
 
connections
 
are
 
only
 
recruited
 
for
 
the
 
study.
 
 
5.
 
Thematic/Domain
 
skills:
 
As
 
per
 
the
 
research
 
topic
 
and
 
respondents’
 
type,
 
CMS
 
recruits
 
only
 
those
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
two
 
years
 
of
 
work
 
experience
 
in
 
the
 
required
 
domains
 
and

A
 
detailed
 
training
 
and
 
orienting
 
process
 
is
 
designed
 
at
 
multiple
 
levels,
 
including
 
the
 
training
 
of
 
trainers.
 
Training
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
on
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
data
 
collection
 
including
 
programme
 
background,
 
objectives
 
and
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
study,
 
sampling
 
techniques
 
and
 
replacement
 
methodology,
 
discussion
 
on
 
each
 
question
 
with
 
probing
 
methods,
 
logistics
 
planning
 
and
 
support.
 
Given
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
the
 
respondent
 
type,
 
gender
 
sensitivity
 
training
 
will
 
be
 
administered
 
tailored
 
to
 
speciﬁc
 
needs
 
and
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
population.
 
A
 
scientiﬁc
 
approach
 
to
 
the
 
training
 
process
 
will
 
be
 
ensured
 
by
 
creating
 
standard
 
training
 
protocols,
 
manuals
 
including
 
standardisation
 
in
 
survey
 
techniques.
 
Mock
 
surveys
 
and
 
ﬁeld
 
days
 
are
 
planned
 
for
 
the
 
team
 
for
 
in-ﬁeld
 
experience
 
with
 
the
 
software
 
and
 
survey
 
tool.
 
Further,
 
the
 
enumerators
 
are
 
trained
 
to
 
hold
 
all
 
biases,
 
opinions,
 
claims,
 
and
 
other
 
features
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
associated
 
with
 
individuals.
 
They
 
will
 
also
 
sign
 
a
 
conﬁdentiality
 
agreement
 
with
 
CMS
 
agreeing
 
to
 
use
 
conﬁdential
 
information
 
only
 
for
 
the
 
purposes
 
set
 
out
 
in
 
the
 
training,
 
and
 
not
 
disclose
 
the
 
information
 
to
 
any
 
other
 
party.
 
The
 
enumerators
 
will
 
be
 
trained
 
on
 
the
 
understanding
 
to
 
not
 
copy
 
or
 
retain
 
or
 
share
 
any
 
written
 
information
 
or
 
record
 
that
 
could
 
be
 
associated
 
with
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
individuals
 
or
 
identifying
 
features
 
of
 
any
 
sort,
 
after
 
the
 
study
 
period.
 
And
 
that
 
at
 
the
 
conclusion
 
of
 
the
 
surveys
 
all
 
conﬁdential
 
information,
 
including
 
questionnaires,
 
written
 
notes,
 
photographs,
 
memoranda,
 
or
 
other
 
types
 
of
 
notes
 
taken
 
to
 
be
 
given
 
to
 
the
 
team.
 
3.3.5
 
Plan
 
to
 
Ensure
 
Quality
 
Data
 
Collection
 
and
 
Management
 
With
 
over
 
200
 
projects
 
and
 
an
 
in-house
 
portfolio
 
for
 
data
 
collection,
 
CMS
 
has
 
strong
 
expertise
 
in
 
ensuring
 
quality
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
follows
 
strong
 
protocols
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
The
 
team
 
has
 
been
 
following
 
stringent
 
guidelines
 
around
 
safety
 
and
 
hygiene,
 
following
 
international
 
standards.
 
 
1.
 
After
 
the
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
ﬁnalised
 
in
 
consultation
 
with
 
[Client
 
Organization],
 
researchers
 
from
 
the
 
CMS
 
team
 
will
 
conduct
 
a
 
pilot
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
well
 
tailored
 
to
 
the
 
location,
 
project
 
context
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
cultural
 
point
 
of
 
view.
 
Once
 
the
 
post-pilot
 
changes
 
are
 
completed,
 
the
 
tool
 
is
 
scripted
 
and
 
tested
 
in-house
 
(for
 
skips
 
and
 
validations)
 
by
 
researchers
 
and
 
tested
 
in
 
a
 
setting
 
similar
 
to
 
that
 
of
 
the
 
intended
 
sample.
 
2.
 
The
 
ﬁnal
 
questionnaire
 
is
 
translated
 
into
 
local
 
language
 
by
 
experienced
 
thematic
 
translators
 
to
 
retain
 
the
 
essence
 
and
 
yet
 
contextualise
 
for
 
the
 
local
 
language.
 
Translated
 
tools
 
undergo
 
a
 
proofreading
 
exercise
 
to
 
check
 
the
 
consistency
 
and
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
translation
 
by
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
who
 
is
 
well
 
versed
 
in
 
the
 
local
 
language.
 
3.
 
Monitoring
 
of
 
data
 
quality
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
aspect
 
of
 
data
 
collection.
 
Poor
 
quality
 
data
 
reduces
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
policy
 
intervention
 
and
 
can
 
also
 
require
 
a
 
repeat
 
of
 
the
 
entire
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
Therefore,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
sets
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
and
 
protocols
 
for
 
the
 
monitoring
 
and
 
quality
 
assurance
 
that
 
include
 
maintaining
 
a
 
real-time
 
MIS
 
dashboard
 
of
 
collection,
 
minimising
 
non-response
 
with
 
2-3
 
attempts,
 
ensuring
 
enumerator
 
quality
 
controls
 
with
 
spot
 
checks,
 
back
 
checks
 
(on
 
major
 
topics,
 
time
 
taken,
 
etc.)
 
and
 
looping
 
mechanisms.
 
 
4.
 
Data
 
management
 
is
 
a
 
crucial
 
yet
 
often
 
overlooked
 
aspect
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
collection
 
process.
 
The
 
CMS
 
team
 
has
 
robust
 
processes,
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data
 
is
 
stored
 
online
 
on
 
secured
 
servers
 
synched
 
in
 
real-time
 
that
 
ensure
 
data
 
security.
 
All
 
hard
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
notes,
 
qualitative
 
interviews,
 
etc.
 
are
 
scanned
 
and
 
uploaded
 
almost
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
data.

Data
 
cleaning
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
most
 
critical
 
step
 
between
 
data
 
collection
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
CMS
 
believes
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
rigorous
 
process,
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
analysis
 
is
 
correlated
 
to
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
data
 
cleaning.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
validation
 
exercise
 
is
 
completed
 
in
 
real-time
 
to
 
avoid
 
post-cleaning
 
efforts
 
including
 
id
 
variable
 
checking,
 
outlier
 
tagging,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
replacements,
 
illogical
 
value
 
assessment,
 
addressing
 
typos,
 
survey
 
codes,
 
missing
 
values
 
and
 
adding
 
labels.
 
Irregularities
 
and
 
corrections
 
are
 
identiﬁed
 
and
 
documented,
 
but
 
changes
 
are
 
made
 
only
 
after
 
introspection
 
with
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
and
 
the
 
qualitative
 
insights.

Overview
 
of
 
the
 
work
 
plan
 
(Gantt
 
Chart)
 
with
 
timelines
 
is
 
provided
 
in
 
Annexure-5.
 
Stage
 
1:
 
Contracting
 
&amp;
 
Inception
 
Meeting
:
 
The
 
ﬁrst
 
stage
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
good
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
expectations
 
of
 
the
 
stakeholders,
 
review
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
and
 
other
 
documents,
 
and
 
develop
 
the
 
overall
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
and
 
methods.
 
The
 
inception
 
meeting
 
will
 
be
 
held
 
with
 
the
 
project
 
staff
 
and
 
other
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
ﬁnalise
 
the
 
approach
 
of
 
the
 
study,
 
ideally
 
within
 
a
 
week
 
of
 
the
 
contract
 
signing.
 
The
 
work
 
will
 
commence
 
thereafter
 
based
 
on
 
mutual
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
study.
 
An
 
inception
 
report
 
will
 
be
 
submitted
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
this
 
stage.
 
The
 
study
 
team
 
will
 
also
 
bring
 
previous
 
experience
 
and
 
learnings
 
to
 
better
 
inform
 
the
 
study
 
methodology
 
for
 
this
 
phase.
 
Stage
 
2:
 
Secondary
 
Review:
 
Following
 
the
 
submission
 
of
 
the
 
inception
 
report,
 
secondary
 
review
 
encompassing
 
a
 
literature
 
review
 
that
 
will
 
gather
 
insights
 
from
 
peer-reviewed
 
articles,
 
assessment
 
reports,
 
gender
 
concepts,
 
theories,
 
and
 
case
 
studies
 
will
 
be
 
conducted
 
for
 
the
 
initial
 
two
 
months.
 
It
 
will
 
be
 
followed
 
with
 
a
 
meticulous
 
examination
 
of
 
program
 
documents,
 
including
 
the
 
theory
 
of
 
change,
 
strategy,
 
progress
 
reports,
 
past
 
research,
 
and
 
program
 
monitoring
 
data.
 
Finally,
 
we
 
will
 
synthesise
 
ﬁndings,
 
formulate
 
targeted
 
lines
 
of
 
enquiry,
 
and
 
determine
 
the
 
program's
 
classiﬁcation
 
as
 
gender-instrumental,
 
gender-sensitive,
 
or
 
gender-transformative.
 
The
 
overarching
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
good
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
and
 
develop
 
the
 
overall
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
and
 
methods
 
that
 
is
 
more
 
gender-intentional,
 
fostering
 
inclusivity,
 
and
 
maximising
 
its
 
impact.
 
Stage
 
3:
 
Primary
 
Review:
 
 
A
 
month-long
 
primary
 
review
 
process
 
focused
 
on
 
deepening
 
understanding
 
and
 
assessing
 
the
 
T/NI
 
program's
 
impact
 
through
 
direct
 
engagement
 
with
 
program
 
teams
 
and
 
immersive
 
ﬁeld
 
visits
 
will
 
be
 
undertaken.
 
The
 
ﬁeld
 
immersion
 
visit
 
will
 
enable
 
us
 
to
 
understand
 
participants'
 
perceptions
 
of
 
economic
 
mobility
 
and
 
decision-making.
 
Followed
 
by
 
debrieﬁng
 
with
 
the
 
Impact
 
team
 
at
 
[Client
 
Organization].
 
The
 
direct
 
interactions
 
with
 
program
 
teams
 
will
 
provide
 
insights
 
into
 
their
 
experiences
 
and
 
activities
 
ensuring
 
a
 
nuanced
 
understanding
 
of
 
on-the-ground
 
realities,
 
contributing
 
to
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
program
 
assessment.

Framework:
 
Over
 
the
 
next
 
phase,
 
building
 
upon
 
insights
 
garnered
 
from
 
extensive
 
primary
 
and
 
secondary
 
reviews,
 
our
 
team
 
will
 
embark
 
on
 
developing
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
conceptual
 
framework
 
for
 
the
 
program.
 
This
 
will
 
involve
 
crafting
 
an
 
engendered
 
theory
 
of
 
change
 
and
 
an
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
encompassing
 
key
 
evaluation
 
questions,
 
pertinent
 
indicators,
 
metrics,
 
and
 
specialised
 
data
 
collection
 
tools.
 
This
 
phase
 
will
 
culminate
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁnalisation
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
framework,
 
that
 
not
 
only
 
assesses
 
program
 
impact
 
but
 
also
 
contributes
 
to
 
shifting
 
gender
 
power
 
dynamics
 
for
 
sustainable
 
change.
 
Stage
 
5:
 
Sampling
 
and
 
Tool
 
Design:
 
In
 
this
 
stage
 
the
 
methodology
 
plan
 
for
 
the
 
evaluation
 
will
 
be
 
ﬁnalised
 
incorporating
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
sampling
 
strategy
 
for
 
diverse
 
representation.
 
Both
 
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
tools,
 
including
 
an
 
intersectionality
 
tool,
 
the
 
Decision-Making
 
matrix
 
will
 
be
 
developed
 
to
 
analyse
 
power
 
dynamics
 
and
 
gender
 
considerations
 
within
 
the
 
program's
 
decision-making
 
processes.
 
Translation,
 
digitization,
 
and
 
pretesting
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
tools
 
will
 
promptly
 
follow
 
the
 
submission
 
of
 
the
 
inception
 
report.
 
This
 
phase
 
will
 
culminate
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁnalisation
 
of
 
the
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
questionnaires,
 
the
 
sample
 
frame,
 
and
 
the
 
determined
 
sample
 
size.

It
 
will
 
involve
 
the

HIV-AIDS
 
Alliance
 
works
 
on
 
the
 
Bill
 
and
 
Melinda
 
Gates
 
HIV
 
and
 
AIDS
 
prevention
 
programme,
 
Avahana.
 
The
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
programme
 
is
 
protection
 
and
 
prevention
 
of
 
HIV
 
epidemic
 
among
 
key
 
populations
 
–
 
FSWs,
 
MSMs
 
and
 
TGs.
 
Its
 
interventions
 
in
 
the
 
Telangana
 
and
 
Rayalaseema
 
districts
 
of
 
Andhra
 
Pradesh
 
are
 
implemented
 
through
 
23
 
NGO
 
partners.
 
Alliance
 
plans
 
to
 
expand
 
its
 
sexual
 
and
 
reproductive
 
health
 
(SRH)
 
interventions.
 
It
 
will
 
initiate
 
the
 
interventions
 
in
 
three
 
selected
 
sites
 
through
 
action
 
research
 
and
 
subsequently
 
expand
 
it
 
to
 
other
 
sites
 
in
 
their
 
programme
 
area.
 
To
 
help
 
them
 
design
 
the
 
intervention,
 
Alliance
 
has
 
commissioned
 
CMS
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
sexual
 
and
 
reproductive
 
health
 
needs
 
of
 
the
 
target
 
community
 
and
 
the
 
barriers
 
preventing
 
them
 
in
 
accessing
 
the
 
present
 
SRH
 
services.
 
The
 
study
 
had
 
a
 
coverage
 
of
 
three
 
sites
 
selected
 
for
 
the
 
action
 
research.
 
CMS
 
employed
 
pre-tested,
 
semi-structured
 
questionnaires
 
to
 
collect
 
data
 
from
 
the
 
respondents
 
and
 
conduct
 
FGDs
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
of
 
a
 
pre-tested
 
checklist.
 
 
Multiple
 
research
 
papers
 
have
 
been
 
published
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
report
 
and
 
since
 
the

Finalisation
 
of
 
the
 
evaluation
 
and
 
analytical
 
framework
 
CMS
 
approached
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
by
 
developing
 
a
 
detailed
 
approach
 
on
 
methodology
 
will
 
be
 
utilised,
 
including
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
data
 
collection
 
approaches,
 
sampling
 
strategy,
 
data
 
collection
 
methods
 
and
 
systems/technology
 
to
 
use,
 
ﬁeld
 
procedures,
 
quality
 
control
 
practices
 
and
 
data
 
analysis.
 
The
 
evaluation
 
and
 
the
 
analytical
 
framework
 
for
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
was
 
extracted
 
from
 
the
 
programme
 
design
 
framework
 
tools
 
developed
 
by
 
[Client
 
Organization],
 
i.e.,
 
the

FPO
 
Business
 
Transformation
 
Model
 
(BTM)
 
and
 
Living

Benchmark
 
(LIB).
 
Since
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
results
 
and
 
insights
 
will
 
be
 
utilized
 
to
 
streamline
 
the
 
intervention
 
design
 
and
 
the
 
methodology
 
for
 
the
 
intervention
 
delivery,
 
it
 
is
 
critical
 
to
 
overlay
 
the
 
evaluation
 
approach
 
on
 
the
 
programme
 
design
 
frameworks
 
and
 
extract
 
functional
 
indicator
 
measurement
 
framework.
 
 
 
As
 
a
 
precursor
 
to
 
this
 
process,
 
the
 
approach
 
has
 
been
 
to
 
establish
 
and
 
document
 
the
 
base
 
values
 
of
 
the
 
project’s
 
indicators
 
in
 
relation
 
to
 
the
 
objectives
 
and
 
impact
 
areas.
 
CMS
 
developed
 
an
 
IPP
 
indicator
 
map
 
and
 
possible
 
targets
 
for
 
each
 
Result
 
level
 
indicators
 
are
 
tracked
 
through
 
different
 
tool
 
and
 
corresponding
 
mixed
 
method
 
approach
 
has
 
been
 
established
 
in
 
this
 
process.
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
indicators
 
are
 
transferable
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
integrated
 
with
 
the
 
project

with
 
the

and

SAMPLING
 
APPROACH
 
 
The
 
overall
 
approaching
 
for
 
HH
 
sampling
 
is
 
as
 
follows:
 
●
 
The
 
sampling
 
frame
 
would
 
be
 
16
 
FPOs
 
covering
 
around
 
800
 
HHs
 
in
 
total.
 
 
●
 
The
 
sample
 
size
 
would
 
be
 
50
 
HHs
 
per
 
FPO.
 
●
 
The
 
control
 
in
 
sampling
 
would
 
be
 
for
 
women
 
representation
 
where
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
sample
 
per
 
FPO
 
would
 
be
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
proportion
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
raw
 
data
 
shared,
 
these
 
proportions
 
are
 
indicated
 
in

SAMPLING
 
PROCESS
:
 
The
 
sampling
 
plan
 
detailed
 
below
 
provides
 
an
 
outline
 
of
 
the
 
process
 
with
 
which
 
the
 
households
 
were
 
sampled.
 
 
●
 
The
 
sampling
 
frame
 
of
 
eight
 
FPOs
 
from
 
Nellore
 
and
 
Anantapur
 
districts
 
was
 
used
 
for
 
sampling.
 
 
●
 
A
 
purposive
 
sampling
 
technique
 
was
 
used
 
for
 
the
 
selection
 
of
 
50
 
households
 
from
 
each
 
FPO.
 
 
●
 
The
 
ﬁnal
 
list
 
of
 
households
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
sampled
 
for
 
the
 
study,
 
will
 
be
 
randomly
 
selected
 
from
 
the
 
household
 
sampling
 
frame.
 
●
 
Villages
 
with
 
the
 
concentrated
 
member
 
base
 
were
 
considered
 
the
 
purposive
 
sampling
 
of
 
households
 
within
 
each
 
FPO.
 
 
●
 
As
 
indicated
 
in
 
the
 
approach
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
women
 
in
 
the
 
sample
 
was
 
ensured
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
that
 
of
 
the
 
population.
 
 
The
 
household
 
entries
 
with
 
missing
 
gender
 
information
 
were
 
removed,
 
post
 
the

assurance
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld

will
 
go
 
a
 
long
 
way
 
in
 
ensuring
 
high
 
quality
 
data.
 
The
 
quality
 
assurance
 
of
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
research
 
will
 
be
 
ensured
 
through
 
the
 
following
 
process:
 
●
 
Detailed
 
overall
 
planning
 
for
 
ﬁeld
 
work,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
monitored
 
closely,
 
every
 
day,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
survey
 
tasks
 
planned,
 
survey
 
tasks
 
achieved
 
and
 
variance.
 
●
 
Each
 
interview
 
will
 
be
 
tracked
 
via
 
GPS
 
location,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
automated
 
and
 
done
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
interviews.
 
●
 
Spot-check
 
visits
 
–
 
Random
 
and
 
unannounced
 
visits
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
State
 
Coordinators
 
and
 
Supervisors
 
to
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
location
 
of
 
each
 
ﬁeld
 
team
 
to
 
cross-check
 
the
 
accuracy
 
and
 
completeness
 
of
 
data.
 
This
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
following:
 
●
 
Check
 
if
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator
 
interviewed
 
the
 
correct,
 
desired
 
and
 
intended
 
respondents.
 
●
 
Obtain
 
information
 
from
 
the
 
household
 
members
 
on
 
whether
 
a
 
reported
 
visit
 
(by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator)
 
was
 
indeed
 
made.
 
●
 
Find
 
out
 
about
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator’s
 
conduct
 
during
 
visits.
 
●
 
Discuss
 
any
 
concerns
 
of
 
community
 
(Registered/
 
sample/target
 
population)
 
during
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
ﬁeld
 
work
 
●
 
Verify
 
events
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
reported
 
by
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
investigator.
 
●
 
Back-Check
 
-
 
The
 
back-check
 
will
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
Supervisors.
 
The
 
interviewees
 
will
 
be
 
contacted
 
telephonically
 
and
 
at
 
least
 
5%
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
indicators
 
will
 
be
 
checked
 
for
 
their
 
authenticity
 
and
 
accuracy.
 
This
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
done
 
randomly
 
for
 
each

Number
 
of
 
refusals
 
to

Anticipated
 
Risks
 
and
 
Mitigation
 
plan
 
The
 
risks
 
that
 
are
 
anticipated
 
at
 
this
 
stage
 
are
 
mentioned
 
below:
 
1.
 
A
 
small
 
proportion
 
of
 
the
 
CAPI
 
devices
 
usually
 
face
 
technical
 
issues
 
(blanking
 
of
 
screen,
 
keyboard
 
issues,
 
etc.)
 
daily.
 
For
 
small
 
errors,
 
these
 
devices
 
will
 
be
 
rectiﬁed
 
in
 
the
 
ﬁeld
 
with
 
the
 
help
 
from
 
the
 
supervisor
 
personnel,
 
who
 
will
 
provide
 
instructions
 
over
 
telephone
 
using
 
toll
 
free
 
numbers.
 
In
 
case
 
a
 
device
 
is
 
irreparable,
 
the
 
device
 
will
 
be
 
replaced.
 
 
2.
 
CAPI
 
based
 
surveys
 
are
 
usually
 
not
 
conducted
 
in
 
areas
 
affected
 
by
 
political
 
unrest.
 
There
 
is
 
always
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
teams
 
being
 
kidnapped
 
and
 
the
 
devices
 
being
 
retained
 
or
 
conﬁscated
 
by
 
local
 
stakeholders.
 
Careful
 
planning
 
will
 
be
 
undertaken
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
Olam
 
team
 
to
 
protect
 
the
 
teams
 
and
 
the
 
devices
 
while
 
survey
 
is
 
on-going
 
in
 
these
 
areas.
 
At,
 
CMS
 
we
 
have
 
insurance
 
coverage
 
for
 
full
 
time
 
employees.
 
Networking
 
consultants
 
are
 
having
 
their
 
own
 
personal
 
insurance
 
plans
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
not
 
responsible
 
for
 
that.
 
However,
 
any
 
unforeseen
 
incidents
 
happen
 
during
 
ﬁeld
 
work,
 
organisation
 
support
 
the
 
network
 
consultants/part-time
 
employees.
 
3.
 
Drop-out
 
of
 
trained
 
interviewers
 
–
 
especially
 
due
 
to
 
illness
 
–
 
is
 
always
 
a
 
risk.
 
Extra
 
enumerators
 
will
 
be
 
recruited
 
before
 
training
 
to
 
replace
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
dropouts.
 
The
 
Covid19
 
situation
 
may
 
exacerbate
 
the
 
situation,
 
but
 
we
 
will
 
recruit
 
additional
 
interviewers
 
for
 
this.
 
 
4.
 
While
 
the
 
unlock
 
5
 
guidelines
 
say
 
that
 
no
 
restrictions
 
apply
 
on
 
any
 
economic
 
activity,
 
any
 
change
 
in
 
government
 
advisory
 
might
 
delay
 
the
 
timelines.
 
Also
 
travel
 
within
 
containment
 
zones
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
possible.
 
We
 
have
 
recruited
 
local
 
staff
 
to
 
avoid
 
intra-state,
 
intra-district
 
travel
 
but
 
if
 
any
 
of
 
the
 
villages/respondents
 
come
 
in
 
a
 
containment
 
zone,
 
it
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
delays
 
and
 
higher
 
non-response
 
could
 
be
 
anticipated.
 
We
 
will
 
need
 
additional
 
replacement
 
samples
 
as
 
a
 
mitigating
 
strategy.

Summary
 
 
The
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
was
 
launched
 
by
 
([CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION])
 
–
 
Gujarat.
 
The
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
is
 
aimed
 
at
  
improving
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
1000
 
participating
 
tribal
 
families
 
through
 
the
 
promotion
 
of
 
an
 
integrated
 
farming
 
system
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
Agro-Horti-Forestry
 
([Client
 
Project])
 
approach.
 
This
 
objective
 
is
 
envisaged
 
to
 
be
 
achieved
 
by
 
focusing
 
on
 
development
 
of
 
underutilized
 
lands
 
through
 
soil
 
and
 
water
 
conservation,
 
plantation
 
of
 
horticulture
 
and
 
forestry
 
trees
 
and
 
cultivation
 
of
 
suitable
 
short
 
gestation
 
crops/
 
intercrops.
 
Capacity
 
building
 
of
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers
 
and
 
formation
 
and
 
strengthening
 
of
 
a
 
collective
 
of
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers
 
is
 
another
 
objective
 
of
 
the
 
project.
 
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
has
 
partnered
 
with
 
Catalyst
 
Management
 
Services
 
(CMS),
 
Bangalore
 
to
 
conduct
 
a
 
baseline
 
study
 
for
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
intervention.
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
baseline
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
map
 
the
 
current
 
status
 
of
 
water,
 
land
 
and
 
soil
 
conservation
 
practices
 
and
 
current
 
agricultural
 
and
 
agro-forestry
 
practices
 
with
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
collecting
 
data
 
from
 
both
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
groups
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
enable
 
impact
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
at
 
the
 
endline.
 
Extensive
 
socio-economic
 
and
 
demographic
 
proﬁling
 
of
 
the
 
tribal
 
communities
 
with
 
a
 
special
 
focus
 
on
 
women
 
and
 
other
 
marginalised
 
communities
 
has
 
been
 
done
 
in
 
this
 
study.
 
Mapping
 
these
 
baseline
 
values
 
would
 
potentially
 
enable
 
effective
 
measurement
 
of
 
the
 
project's
 
outcome
 
and
 
impact
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
on
 
indicators
 
like
 
increase
 
in
 
income,
  
water
 
availability,
  
and
 
agricultural
 
production.
    
 
An
 
inception
 
report
 
with
 
detailed
 
research
 
methodology
 
guided
 
the
 
research
 
objectives
 
for
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
capturing
 
short
 
term
 
and
 
long
 
term
 
indicators
 
as
 
prescribed
 
in
 
the
 
RFP.
  
 
The
 
sampling
 
strategy
 
and
 
the
 
survey
 
instruments
 
were
 
adopted
 
in
 
line
 
with
 
the
 
principles
 
of
 
ensuring
 
representation
 
of
 
population
 
in
 
the
 
universe,
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
the
 
targeted

groups
 
namely
 
treatment
 
and

have
 
been
 
surveyed
 
(as
 
necessitated
 
by
 
the
 
Difference-in-Differences
 
method
 
of
 
impact
 
evaluation).
 
Accordingly,
 
179
 
farmers
 
from
 
treatment
 
areas
 
and
 
132
 
farmers
 
from
 
comparison
 
areas
 
have
 
been
 
surveyed
 
for
 
the
 
study.
 
This
 
baseline
 
report
 
presents
 
quantitative
 
ﬁndings
 
and
 
the
 
applicable
 
qualitative
 
snippets
 
pertaining
 
to
 
the
 
various
 
sections
 
of
 
the
 
study.
 
Baseline
 
values
 
of
 
the
 
outcomes
 
of
 
the
 
program
 
have
 
been
 
mapped
 
using
 
indicators
 
on
 
socioeconomic
 
status,
 
demographic
 
pattern,
 
landholding
 
types,
 
agriculture
 
and
 
natural
 
resource
 
management
 
practices
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
households.
 
These
 
ﬁndings
 
reveal
 
that
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group,
 
56.42%
 
of
 
the
 
sample
  
belong
 
to
 
the
 
below
 
poverty
 
line
 
(BPL)
 
category.
 
A
 
typical
 
farmer’s
 
median
 
total
 
land
 
holding
 
is
 
100
 
guntha
 
which
 
comprises
 
their
 
own
 
land
 
and
 
land
 
titles
 
given
 
by
 
the
 
government
 
under
 
FRA
 
(Forest
 
Rights
 
Act).
 
More
 
than
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
179
 
people
 
surveyed
 
(86.52%)
 
are
 
small
 
and
 
marginal
 
farmers
 
owning
 
up
 
to
 
200
 
guntha
 
land
 
and
 
earning
 
a
 
median
 
annual
 
income
 
of
 
Rs.
 
85,000
 
which
 
is
 
mainly
 
accrued
 
from
 
farming
 
or
 
working
 
as
 
an
 
agricultural
 
or
 
migrant
 
laborer.
 
 
Baseline
 
agricultural
 
indicators
1
 
testify
 
that
 
the
 
majority
 
respondents
 
are
 
subsistence
 
farmers
 
with
 
100%
 
of
 
them
 
cultivating
 
in
 
the
 
Kharif
 
season.
 
Paddy
 
is
 
the
 
primary
 
crop
 
grown
 
(by
 
98.31%
 
respondents)
 
but
 
most
 
retain
 
it
 
for
 
self-consumption
 
and
 
don’t
 
sell
 
it
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
Tuvar
 
and
 
Urad
 
dal
 
are
 
the
 
other
 
crops
 
grown
 
in
 
the
 
kharif
 
season.
 
95.50%
 
farmers
 
take
 
more
 
than
 
1
 
crop
 
in
 
the
 
kharif
 
season.
 
Tindora
 
(Ivy
 
gourd)
 
is
 
the
 
main
 
revenue
 
generating
 
crop
 
and
 
is
 
grown
 
by
 
about
 
25.28%
 
respondents
 
in
 
the
 
kharif
 
season
 
and
 
14.71%
 
respondents
 
in
 
the
 
rabi
 
season.
 
70.22%
 
of
 
all
 
farmers
 
are
 
fully
 
dependent
 
on
 
rain.
 
About
 
29.77%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
irrigate
 
their
 
ﬁelds.
 
Given
 
this
 
fact,
 
it
 
is
 
hardly
 
surprising
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
only
 
38.20%
 
practice
 
agriculture
 
in
 
the
 
rabi
 
season.
 
90.45%
 
people
 
report
 
‘lack
 
of
 
water’
 
as
 
their
 
primary
 
agricultural
 
challenge
 
with
 
46.24%
 
stating
 
that
 
they
 
require
 
irrigation
 
facilities
 
in
 
months
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
Kharif
 
season.
 
These
 
months
 
then
 
witness
 
about
 
35.75%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents
 
migrating
 
to
 
far-off
 
places
 
for
 
odd
 
jobs
 
citing
 
no
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
villages
 
and
 
better
 
employment
 
opportunities
 
outside
 
as
 
their
 
main
 
reasons
 
for
 
doing

Indicators
 
pertaining
 
to
 
natural
 
resource
 
management
 
show
 
that
 
not
 
more
 
than
 
30%
 
of
 
the
 
53
 
people
 
using
 
irrigation
 
facilities
 
told
 
of
 
practicing
 
water
 
conservation
 
measures.
 
Farm
 
bunding
 
is
 
the
 
preferred
 
practice
 
for
 
conserving
 
land
 
and
 
soil
 
and
 
is
 
practiced
 
by
 
about
 
68.54%
  
of
 
the
 
179
 
respondents.
 
 
The
 
outcomes
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
that
 
determine
 
its
 
sustainability
 
have
 
been
 
tracked
 
using
 
indicators
 
related
 
to
 
status
 
of
 
community
 
institutions
 
like
 
FPOs,
 
water
 
user
 
groups
 
and
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
tukdis
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
areas.
 
99.44%
 
of
 
the
 
179
 
respondents
 
asserted
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
not
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
any
 
producer
 
collective
 
with
 
only
 
18.99%
 
knowing
 
of
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
one
 
in
 
their
 
village
 
or
 
block.
 
Similarly,
 
97.21%
 
respondents
 
reported
 
not
 
being
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
any
 
water
 
user
 
group
 
formed
 
for
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
conservation
 
of
 
water
 
resources.
 
Thus,
 
the
 
study
 
did
 
not
 
ﬁnd
 
any
 
conclusive
 
evidence
 
of
 
effectively
 
functioning
 
water
 
user
 
groups
 
or
 
farmer
 
producer
 
organizations
 
(FPO)
 
in

73.74%
 
of
 
the

for
 
the

of
 
successfully
 
executing
 
and
 
sustaining
 
the
 
[CLIENT

program.
 
This
 
result
 
can
 
be
 
substantiated
 
given
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
intervention
 
has
 
already
 
been
 
initiated
 
in
 
many
 
treatment
 
villages.
 
Another
 
interesting
 
fact
 
to
 
be
 
noted
 
is
 
that
 
even
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
intervention,
 
about
 
65.92%
 
farmers
 
claim
 
to
 
currently
 
have
 
their
 
own
 
agroforestry
 
cultivation
 
with
 
most
 
people
 
having
 
about
 
15
 
mango
 
trees
 
approximately
 
(median).
 
 
A
 
comparative
 
study
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
and

groups
 
is
 
another
 
important
 
aim
 
of
 
this
 
study.
 
Key
 
ﬁndings
 
from
 
the
 
comparative

suggests
 
that
 
the

at
 
118.94
 
guntha
 
and
 
income
 
per
 
acre
 
at

for
 
the

the
 
number
 
and
 
coverage
 
of
 
water
 
and
 
land
 
conservation
 
structures
 
while
 
also
 
reducing
 
distressed
 
migration.
 
Given
 
that
 
no
 
FPO
 
currently
 
operates
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
villages,
 
leveraging
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
the
 
collective
 
and
 
forming
 
an
 
FPO
 
to
 
market
 
and
 
sell
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
produce
 
becomes
 
necessary.
 
Capacity
 
buildings
 
of
 
people
 
and
 
institutions
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
for
 
the
 
interventions
 
to
 
yield
 
a
 
long-term
 
impact.
 
 
Recommendations
 
to
 
the
 
programme
 
design
   
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
ﬁndings
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
survey,
 
we
 
propose
 
the
 
following
 
recommendations
 
for
 
the
 
successful
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
program.
 
a)
 
Impact
 
evaluation
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
:
 
With
 
the
 
intention
 
of
 
using
 
the
 
Difference-in-Differences
 
method
 
of
 
impact
 
evaluation
 
at
 
the
 
endline,
 
two
 
groups
 
namely
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
have
 
been
 
surveyed
 
at
 
the
 
baseline
 
(A
 
short
 
note
 
on
 
DID
 
has
 
been
 
added
 
in
 
the
 
appendix
 
for
 
reference).
 
Surveying
 
two
 
such
 
groups
 
is
 
required
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
impact
 
measured
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
intervention
 
while
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
all
 
other
 
factors
 
affecting
 
the
 
impact
 
indicators
 
will
 
be
 
nulliﬁed.
 
Also,
 
DID
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
used
 
provided
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
show
 
parallel
 
trends
 
(i.e.
 
similar
 
patterns
 
of
 
socioeconomic
 
growth)
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
baseline.
 
 
However,
 
considerable
 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
groups
 
have
 
been
 
observed
 
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
study.
 
A
 
t-test
 
was
 
conducted
 
on
 
the
 
data
 
to
 
check
 
for
 
signiﬁcant
 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
means
 
of
 
some
 
important
 
characteristics
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
groups
 
(results
 
attached
 
in
 
appendix).
 
T-test
 
results
 
indicate
 
signiﬁcant
 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
on
 
parameters
 
like
 
annual
 
income,
 
total
 
and
 
cultivated
 
land
 
and
 
migration.
 
Apart
 
from
 
this
 
evidence
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
quantitative
 
data,
 
qualitative
 
information
 
received
 
from
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
(attestation
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
appendix)
 
also
 
points
 
towards
 
inherent
 
dissimilarities
 
between
 
the
 
groups.
 
Firstly,
 
the
 
comparison
 
villages
 
are
 
located
 
on
 
a
 
more
 
hilly
 
and
 
undulating
 
terrain
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
7
 


 
treatment
 
group
 
which
 
leads
 
to
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
villages
 
having
 
more
 
privately
 
owned
 
land
 
although
 
the
 
FRA
 
land
 
is
 
similarly
 
allocated
 
in
 
both
 
sets
 
of
 
villages.
 
Secondly,
 
1
 
big
 
developmental
 
project
 
was
 
implemented
 
by
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
villages
 
more
 
than
 
15-20
 
years
 
ago
 
which
 
made
 
people
 
in
 
these
 
areas
 
favourably
 
biased
 
towards
 
participating
 
in
 
projects
 
for
 
their
 
socioeconomic
 
development
 
in
 
contrast
 
to
 
people
 
living
 
in
 
comparison
 
areas.
 
This
 
hesitancy
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
residing
 
in
 
comparison
 
villages
 
(especially
 
Tanasiya
 
and
 
Mamabhacha)
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
developmental
 
initiatives
 
is
 
also
 
exacerbated
 
by
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
under
 
heavy
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
the
 
Satipati
 
cult.
 
The
 
cult
 
propagates
 
self-rule
 
and
 
asks
 
its
 
members
 
to
 
refuse
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
any
 
activity
 
undertaken
 
by
 
the
 
state
 
or
 
central
 
government.
 
All
 
these
 
factors
 
have
 
led
 
to
 
the
 
poor
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
comparison
 
areas
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
treatment
 
areas.
 
 
Thus,
 
evidence
 
gathered
 
from
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
data
 
clearly
 
shows
 
that
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
surveyed
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
valid
 
comparison
 
group
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
have
 
inherent
 
differences,
 
the
 
parallel
 
trends
 
assumption
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
satisﬁed.
 
So,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
possible
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
Difference-in-Differences
 
(DID)
 
method
 
for
 
evaluating
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
at
 
the
 
endline.
                           
 
In
 
such
 
a
 
case,
 
Propensity
 
Score
 
Matching
 
(PSM)
 
could
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
surveying
 
a
 
larger
 
pool
 
of
 
respondents
 
at
 
the
 
endline,
 
in
 
turn
 
creating
 
an
 
artiﬁcial
 
comparison
 
group
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
propensity
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
and
 
matching
 
those
 
with
 
the
 
treatment
 
respondents
 
to
 
evaluate
 
outcomes
 
(Note
 
on
 
PSM
 
attached
 
in
 
the
 
appendix).
    
 
Another
 
potential
 
method
 
of
 
evaluating
 
the
 
program
 
is
 
by
 
using
 
the
 
instrumental
 
variables
 
(IV)
 
technique.
 
IV
 
is
 
a
 
2
 
stage
 
regression
 
used
 
in
 
cases
 
where
 
we
 
have
 
incomplete
 
compliance
 
or
 
voluntary
 
enrolment
 
in
 
the
 
program.
 
For
 
this,
 
a
 
random
 
sample
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
surveyed
 
only
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
and
 
an
 
instrumental
 
variable
 
that
 
inﬂuences
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
participating
 
in
 
a
 
program,
 
but
 
is
 
outside
 
of
 
the
 
participant’s
 
control
 
and
 
is
 
unrelated
 
to
 
the
 
participant’s
 
characteristics
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
chosen
 
for
 
doing
 
the
 
2-step
 
regression.
           
 
b)
 
The
 
baseline
 
study
 
ﬁnds
 
that
 
problems
 
like
 
higher
 
migration,
 
lesser
 
landholdings,
 
irrigation
 
challenges
 
and
 
lower
 
incomes
 
that
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
intends
 
to
 
address
 
are
 
more
 
prevalent
 
in
 
the
 
comparison
 
villages
 
than
 
the
 
treatment
 
villages.
 
Hence,
 
going
 
ahead,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
advisable
 
to
 
also
 
implement
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
in
 
villages
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
comparison
 
villages.
 
However,
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
note
 
that
 
the
 
project
 
should
 
not
 
be
 
implemented
 
in
 
the
 
comparison
 
villages
 
used
 
for
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
study
 
as
 
it
 
will
 
induce
 
bias
 
in
 
the
 
impact
 
evaluation
 
results
 
of
 
this
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
if
 
the
 
evaluation
 
methodology
 
of
 
DID
 
is
 
used.
 
 
c)
 
Emphasis
 
on
 
institution
 
building
 
:
 
Although
 
backward
 
linkage
 
with
 
Pindval
 
Cooperative
 
and
 
forward
 
linkage
 
with
 
VAPCOL
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
component
 
of
 
the
 
project,
 
special
 
emphasis
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
laid
 
on
 
capacity
 
building
 
of
 
farmers
 
and
 
the
 
subsequent
 
formation
 
of
 
a
 
collective
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers.
 
This
 
is
 
so
 
because
 
it
 
was
 
found
 
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
that
 
almost
 
all
 
farmers
 
(99.44%)
 
from
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
(N
 
=
 
179)
 
reported
 
not
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
any
 
farmer
 
interest
 
group
 
(FIG)
 
or
 
farmer
 
producer
 
organization
 
(FPO)
 
presently.
 
Also,
 
only
 
18.99%
 
farmers
 
claimed
 
that
 
they
 
knew
 
of
 
an
 
FPO
 
or
 
FIG
 
in
 
their
 
village
 
or
 
block.
 
Given
 
these
 
statistics,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
ground
 
work
 
8
 


 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
done,
 
ﬁrstly,
 
to
 
make
 
people
 
understand
 
the
 
concept
 
of
 
a
 
cooperative
 
and
 
let
 
them
 
know
 
how
 
they
 
can
 
beneﬁt
 
by
 
being
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
it.
 
Hence,
 
this
 
process
 
of
 
institution
 
building
 
needs
 
to
 
start
 
from
 
day
 
1.
 
Once
 
this
 
foundation
 
has
 
been
 
established,
 
only
 
then
 
can
 
the
 
marketing
 
linkages
 
with
 
other
 
organizations
 
be
 
created
 
successfully
 
and
 
sustainably.
 
Also,
 
for
 
the
 
FPO
 
to
 
sustain
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
run,
 
the
 
FPO
 
should
 
trade
 
in
 
other
 
value
 
chains
 
as
 
well
 
besides
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
produce.
 
This
 
will
 
ensure
 
that
 
overall
 
the
 
FPO
 
can
 
engage
 
in
 
a
 
higher
 
volume
 
of
 
business
 
and
 
diversify
 
its
 
income
 
sources.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
produce
 
is
 
getting
 
a
 
lower
 
price
 
in
 
the
 
market
 
then
 
the
 
FPO
 
can
 
possibly
 
earn
 
a
 
proﬁt
 
by
 
trading
 
in
 
other
 
crops
 
which
 
are
 
getting
 
a
 
higher
 
price.
 
Also,
 
the
 
FPO
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
higher
 
number
 
of
 
shareholders
 
if
 
it
 
includes
 
members
 
besides
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers.
 
 
Thus,
 
given
 
the
 
potential
 
multifold
 
advantages
 
of
 
an
 
FPO,
 
the
 
focus
 
on
 
institution
 
building
 
becomes
 
pivotal
 
and
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
stressed
 
upon.
       
 
d)
 
Hydrogeological
 
mapping
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
area
 
:
 
To
 
measure
 
the
 
improvement
 
in
 
quality
 
of
 
land
 
and
 
soil
 
due
 
the
 
necessary
 
conservation
 
initiatives
 
and
 
the
 
increase
 
in
 
ground
 
water
 
levels
 
due
 
to
 
development
 
of
 
water
 
resources,
 
it
 
is
 
imperative
 
to
 
do
 
a
 
hydrogeological
 
mapping
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
area.
 
Hydrogeological
 
mapping
 
of
 
the
 
area
 
is
 
essential
 
to
 
scientiﬁcally
 
gauge
 
the
 
enhancement
 
in
 
land
 
and
 
water
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
region.

Introduction
 
Background
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
Gujarat
 
is
 
implementing
 
one
 
of
 
it’s
 
ﬂagship
 
projects
 
-
 
Agro-Forestry
 
([Client
 
Project])
 
-
 
in
 
Dharampur
 
block
 
of
 
Valsad
 
district
 
in
 
Gujarat.
 
The
 
project
 
aims
 
to
 
cover
 
1000
 
families
 
under
 
this
 
project
 
from
 
the
 
period
 
of
 
November
 
2020
 
to
 
October
 
2023.
 
The
 
rural
 
household
 
is
 
the
 
unit
 
of
 
intervention
 
under
 
the
 
programme.
 
The
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
Project
 
focuses
 
on
 
development
 
of
 
underutilized
 
lands
 
through
 
soil
 
and
 
water
 
conservation,
 
thereby
 
resulting
 
in
 
plantation
 
of
 
horticulture
 
and
 
forestry
 
trees
 
and
 
cultivation
 
of
 
suitable
 
short
 
gestation
 
crops/
 
intercrops.
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
gestation
 
period
 
of
 
the
 
trees
 
and
 
the
 
crops,
 
they
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
become
 
productive;
 
the
 
income
 
from
 
which
 
will
 
enable
 
the
 
rural
 
family
 
to
 
come
 
out
 
of
 
poverty
 
sustainably.
 
Under
 
the
 
project,
 
each
 
participant
 
family
 
takes
 
up
 
intensive
 
land
 
development
 
and
 
plantation
 
work
 
on
 
around
 
one
 
acre
 
of
 
wasteland
 
or
 
marginal
 
land,
 
to
 
convert
 
it
 
into
 
a
 
productive
 
asset.
 
The
 
work
 
to
 
be
 
done
 
on
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
plots
 
involves
 
land
 
shaping
 
through
 
bunds,
 
trenches,
 
digging
 
and
 
ﬁlling
 
of
 
pits,
 
fencing,
 
plantation
 
of
 
fruit
 
and
 
forestry
 
saplings,
 
water
 
resource
 
development,
 
improved
 
agricultural
 
practices,
 
aftercare
 
of
 
plantations
 
etc.
 
Forestry
 
species
 
are
 
planted
 
on
 
the
 
boundaries
 
of
 
the
 
[Client
 
Project],
 
serving
 
as
 
a
 
windbreak
 
for
 
the
 
fruit
 
trees
 
and
 
a
 
source
 
of
 
timber,
 
fodder
 
and
 
fuel
 
wood.
 
The
 
species
 
to
 
be
 
planted
 
are
 
chosen
 
according
 
to
 
their
 
suitability
 
to
 
the
 
project
 
area,
 
their
 
economic
 
value
 
and
 
the
 
preferences
 
of
 
the
 
participating
 
families.
 
The
 
project
 
aims
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
1000
 
participating
 
tribal
 
families
 
through
 
the
 
promotion
 
of
 
an
 
integrated
 
farming
 
system
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
Agro-Horti-Forestry
 
([Client
 
Project])
 
approach.
 
 
The
 
speciﬁc
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
are:

●
 
Enhanced
 
capacity
 
of

Research
 
Methodology
 
a)
 
Research
 
objectives
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
study
 
for
 
establishing
 
current
 
status
 
of
 
both
 
short
 
term
 
and
 
long
 
term
 
indicators
 
of
 
the
 
project.
 
With
 
the
 
aim
 
of
 
evaluating
 
the
 
project's
 
impact
 
at
 
the
 
endline,
 
the
 
given
 
set
 
of
 
indicators
 
have
 
been
 
mapped
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
the
 
comparison
 
villages.
 
The
 
baseline
 
reports
 
will
 
enable
 
measurement
 
of
 
the
 
project’s
 
outcomes
 
and
 
impacts,
 
as
 
committed
 
in
 
the
 
project’s
 
agreement.
 
 
The
 
speciﬁc
 
objectives
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
are
 
as
 
follows
 
:
 
●
 
Document
 
the
 
socio-economic

Research
 
design
 
and
 
sampling
 
The
 
baseline
 
assessment
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
employed
 
a
 
mixed-methods
 
approach
 
where
 
the
 
data
 
was
 
collected
 
from
 
farmers
 
and
 
other
 
stakeholders
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
using
 
quantitative
 
and
 
qualitative
 
methods.
 
The
 
quantitative
 
evaluation
 
answered
 
the
 
questions
 
related
 
to
 
performance
 
of
 
key
 
project
 
indicators
 
both
 
from
 
an
 
input/output
 
to
 
outcome/impact
 
perspective.
 
It
 
was
 
envisaged
 
to
 
collect
 
data
 
from
 
both
 
these
 
sets
 
of
 
people
 
-
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
-
 
at
 
the
 
baseline
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
[CLIENT

project's
 
impact
 
could
 
be
 
measured
 
at
 
the
 
endline.
 
 
Of
 
the
 
12
 
villages
 
namely
 
Avdha,
 
Bopi,
 
Chasmandva,

and
 
Sajanibarda
 
wherein
 
the
 
[CLIENT

project
 
is
 
being
 
implemented,
 
3
 
villages
 
namely
 
Avdha,
 
Bopi
 
and
 
Hanmatmal
 
were
 
selected
 
for
 
sampling
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
population
 
of
 
the
 
villages.
 
Further
 
selection
 
of
 
treatment
 
households
 
for
 
baseline
 
sampling
 
is
 
done
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
people
 
chosen
 
for
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
in
 
a
 
given
 
village.
 
Accordingly,
 
179
 
households
 
are
 
sampled
 
from
 
the
 
3
 
villages
 
of
 
Avdha,
 
Bopi
 
and
 
Hanmatmal
 
and
 
from
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
800
 
households
 
from
 
12
 
villages.
 
For
 
the
 
household
 
surveys,
 
a
 
probability-based
 
random-sampling
 
method
 
was
 
adopted.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
project
 
engages
 
with
 
1,000
 
households,
 
the
 
sample

interval
 
of
 
5%
 
percentage
 
point
 
at
 
95%

level
 
was
 
chosen.
 
 
Primary
 
research
 
was
 
the
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
methodology
 
and
 
included
 
extensive
 
data
 
collection
 
through
 
ﬁeld
 
visits,
 
with
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
thorough

documentation.
 
Along
 
with
 
a
 
structured
 
survey,
 
we
 
conducted
 
unstructured
 
qualitative
 
interactions
 
with
 
the
 
relevant

The
 
[CLIENT

project
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
implemented
 
in
 
villages
 
of
 
Dharampur
 
block
 
in
 
Valsad
 
district
 
of
 
state
 
of
 
Gujarat.
 
The
 
programme
 
villages
 
are
 
representative
 
of
 
a
 
typical
 
situation
 
of
 
backward
 
tribal
 
areas
 
in
 
South
 
Gujarat.
 
The
 
villages
 
are
 
characterized
 
by
 
hilly
 
and
 
undulating
 
topography.
 
The
 
villages
 
face
 
severe
 
water
 
scarcity
 
despite
 
receiving
 
nearly
 
2000
 
mm
 
rainfall
 
annually.
 
The
 
primary
 
occupation
 
of
 
the
 
community
 
is
 
subsistence
 
agriculture.

it
 
can
 
be
 
observed
 
that
 
the

are
 
from
 
the

it
 
can
 
be
 
inferred

are
 
from
 
the

it
 
is

to
 
be
 
working
 
as

Due
 
to

From
 
the
 
table,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
inferred
 
that
 
for
 
the
 
majority
 
respondents
 
from
 
the
 
project
 
villages,
 
the
 
income
 
diversity
 
comes
 
mainly
 
from
 
farming
 
and
 
farm
 
based
 
activities,
 
agricultural/
 
daily
 
wage
 
labour
 
and
 
migration.
 
A
 
handful
 
of
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
self-employed
 
or
 
work
 
in
 
private
 
jobs
 
earn
 
signiﬁcantly
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
rest,
 
thus
 
increasing
 
the
 
mean
 
annual
 
income
 
of
 
the
 
group
 
considerably.
   
 
The
 
median
 
per
 
capita
 
income
 
for
 
the
 
cluster
 
is
 
found
 
to
 
be
 
Rs.
 
18,921
 
which
 
is
 
less
 
than
 
half
 
of
 
Rs.
 
40,925
 
-
 
the
 
per
 
capita
 
income
 
of
 
rural
 
India.
 
The
 
per
 
capita
 
income
 
is
 
lower
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
light
 
of
 
higher
 
diversiﬁcation
 
of
 
income
 
sources.
 
Given
 
this
 
fact,
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
intervention
 
becomes
 
important
 
since
 
it
 
has
 
potential
 
to
 
help
 
increase
 
the
 
per
 
capita
 
income
 
while
 
reducing
 
income
 
source
 
diversiﬁcation.
   
 
Expenditure
 
The
 
median
 
annual
 
expenditure
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
villages
 
is
 
found
 
to
 
be
 
Rs.
 
60,000.

being
 
the

A
 
majority
 
(60.89%)
 
claimed
 
that
 
they
 
do
 
not
 
save
 
any
 
money
 
at
 
all.
 
 
About
 
17.32%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
currently
 
have
 
an
 
outstanding

Of
 
these,
 
about
 
67.74%

said
 
that
 
they
 
take

while
 
the

(32.26%)

7.86%
 
of
 
the
 
sample
 
farm
 
on
 
‘other’
 
land,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
interpreted
 
as
 
land
 
that
 
has
 
no
 
legally
 
determined
 
ownership.
 
Also,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
inferred
 
that
 
almost
 
all
 
land
 
that
 
is
 
cultivable
 
(mean
 
=
 
110.46
 
guntha)
 
is
 
being
 
cultivated
 
(mean
 
=
 
106.78
 
guntha)
 
with
 
hardly
 
any
 
barren
 
land
 
being
 
available.
 
However,
 
only
 
29.77%
 
of
 
all
 
farmers
 
irrigate
 
most
 
of
 
their
 
cultivable
 
land.
 
For
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
irrigate
 
their
 
ﬁelds,
 
the
 
mean
 
irrigation
 
area
 
(to
 
cultivable

percentage
 
is
 
38.76%.
 
The

is

is
 
illustrated

From

that

So,
 
considering
 
179
 
respondents,
 
on
 
average,
 
for
 
a
 
farmer,
 
the
 
potential
 
for
 
increasing

is
 
8.44

Also,
 
29.78%

opine
 
that

while
 
another
 
65.73%

However,
 
in
 
the

that

it

note
 
that
 
the

From
 
the
 
above
 
graph,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
seen
 
that
 
the
 
requirement
 
for
 
irrigation
 
is
 
higher
 
for
 
months
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
kharif
 
season.
 
Despite
 
the
 
region
 
getting
 
high
 
monsoon
 
rainfall
 
(1986
 
mm
 
in
 
2018

),
 
only
 
29.77%
 
of
 
respondents
 
practicing
 
agriculture
 
reported
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
irrigate
 
their
 
ﬁelds.
 
The
 
median
 
area
 
of
 
irrigated
 
land
 
is
 
found
 
to
 
be
 
46.73
 
gunthas
 
while
 
the
 
median
 
cultivated
 
area
 
for
 
respondents
  
irrigating
 
their
 
ﬁelds
 
is
 
120.30
 
gunthas.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
for
 
a
 
typical
 
farmer,
 
about
 
38.84%
 
of
 
his
 
cultivable
 
land
 
is
 
irrigated.
 
Rivers
 
and
 
borewells
 
form
 
the
 
primary
 
source
 
of
 
irrigation
 
for
 
50.94%
 
and
 
32.08%
 
respectively
 
of
 
the
 
53
 
respondents
 
having
 
irrigation
 
facilities.
 
Challenges
 
to
 
irrigation
 
could
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
functional
 
water
 
harvesting
 
structures
 
in
 
the
 
region
 
which
 
is
 
already
 
characterized
 
by
 
a
 
hot
 
and
 
dry
 
summer.
 
The

of
 
effective

100%
 
farmers
 
practicing
 
agriculture
 
(i.e.
 
178
 
people)
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
cultivated
 
their
 
land
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
kharif
 
season.
 
This
 
fact
 
is
 
quite
 
apparent
 
given
 
that
 
the
 
majority
 
farmers
 
are
 
smallholders
 
who
 
practice
 
rainfed
 
agriculture.
 
In
 
the
 
last
 
kharif
 
season
 
(June
 
2020
 
-
 
October
 
2020),
 
a
 
vast
 
majority
 
(98.31%)
 
grew
 
paddy
 
followed
 
by
 
pulses
 
like
 
Tuvar
 
(82.58%)
 
and
 
Urad
 
(81.82%).
 
Some
 
farmers
 
grew
 
Tindora
 
(25.28%)
 
and
 
Ragi
 
(35.39%).
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
farmers
 
in
 
the
 
area
 
own
 
sufﬁcient
 
land,
 
only
 
4.49%
 
of
 
them
 
reported
 
taking
 
a
 
single
 
crop
 
-
 
paddy,
 
while
 
the
 
other
 
95.50%
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
multi-croppers
 
(i.e.
 
they
 
cultivated
 
more
 
than
 
1
 
crop).
 
On
 
an
 
average,
 
farmers
 
cultivate
 
paddy
 
on
 
40.00

From
 
the
 
above
 
table,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
observed
 
that
 
the
 
median
 
total
 
paddy
 
yield
  
is
 
700.00
 
Kg
 
with
 
about
 
600.00
 
Kg
 
being
 
retained
 
for
 
household
 
consumption.
 
The
 
17.5
 
Kg/guntha
 
yield
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
is
 
a
 
little
 
lesser
 
than
 
the
 
cluster
 
yield
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
DPR
 
(2018)
 
prepared
 
by
 
the
 
client
 
-
 
21.68
 
Kg/guntha.
 
Although
 
the
 
median
 
is
 
0,
 
on
 
average,
 
about
 
154.69
 
Kg
 
of
 
the
 
harvest
 
is
 
sold
 
at
 
a
 
per
 
unit
 
price
 
of
 
Rs.
 
13.01
 
generating
 
about
 
Rs.
 
2012.52
 
as
 
income.
 
Approximately,
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
median
 
cultivable
 
land
 
is
 
cultivated
 
with
 
paddy
 
thereby
 
leaving
 
little
 
space
 
for
 
seeds
 
of
 
other
 
crops
 
to
 
be
 
sown
 
in
 
the
 
kharif
 
season.
 
Quite
 
predictably,
 
Urad
 
and
 
Tuvar
 
dal
 
are
 
sown
 
on
 
lesser
 
land
 
area,
 
and
 
generate
 
a
 
yield
 
of
 
10.00
 
Kg
 
and
 
5.00
 
Kg
 
respectively.
 
Both
 
these
 
crops
 
are
 
also
 
grown
 
for
 
self-consumption
 
with
 
no
 
quantity
 
being
 
sold
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
86.67%
 
of
 
those
 
growing
 
Tindora
 
sell
 
this
 
high
 
yielding
 
crop,
 
thereby
  
generating
 
good
 
revenue
 
for
 
themselves.
 
Secondary
 
research
 
suggests
 
that
 
the
 
average
 
yield
 
of
 
Tindora
 
is
 
14
 
tonnes
 
per
 
hectare
 
(141.64
 
Kg/guntha).
 
The
 
baseline
 
survey
 
indicates
 
that
 
tindora
 
yield
 
is
 
132
 
Kg/guntha
 
in
 
the
 
project
 
area
 
which
 
is
 
almost
 
equivalent
 
to
 
the
 
normal
 
yield
 
of
 
the
 
crop
 
in
 
India.

Only
 
38.20%
 
of
 
all
 
farmers
 
(i.e.
 
68
 
farmers)
 
said
 
that
 
they

in
 
the
 
last
 
rabi

(October
 
2020
 
to
 
February

The
 
total
 
area
 
cultivated
 
in
 
the
 
rabi
 
season
 
collectively
 
is
 
1,703.00
 
gunthas.
 
This
 
is
 
highly
 
correlated
 
with
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
irrigation
 
requirements
 
are
 
higher
 
in
 
these
 
months
 
and
 
employment
 
in
 
agriculture
 
decreases
 
signiﬁcantly.
 
Gram,
 
Tindora,
 
Oilseeds,
 
Brinjal

the
 
main
 
crops
 
grown
 
by
 
farmers
 
who

Of
 
the

about
 
61.76%

The

that
 
out
 
of
 
64
 
people
 
migrating,
 
most
 
people
 
(64.79%)
 
generally
 
choose
 
to
 
migrate
 
from
 
the
 
months
 
of
 
November
 
to
 
May.
 
This
 
is
 
in
 
alignment
 
with
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
people
 
cultivate
 
their
 
lands
 
from
 
the
 
months
 
of
 
June
 
to
 
October
 
(Kharif
 
season).
 
Migration
 
starts
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
challenges
 
to
 
irrigate
 
begin
 
to
 
crop
 
up
 
in
 
the
 
rabi
 
season.
 
No
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
village
 
has
 
been
 
mentioned
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
reason
 
for
 
migration.
 
Better
 
employment
 
opportunities
 
outside
 
and
 
irrigation
 
challenges
 
were
 
the
 
other
 
reasons
 
for
 
migration.
 
The
 
FGDs
 
conducted
 
in
 
the
 
villages
 
of
 
Avdha,
 
Bopi
 
and
 
Hanumatmal
 
helped
 
us
 
get
 
the
 
following
 
inferences
 
on
 
the
 
migration
 
practices
 
of
 
the
 
region.
 
According
 
to
 
them,
 
migration
 
starts
 
after
 
Diwali
 
(after
 
October
 
month)
 
and
 
people
 
come
 
back
 
when
 
rain
 
comes.
 
They
 
work
 
mostly
 
in
 
industrial
 
units
 
of
 
Vapi
 
and
 
Valsad,
 
Dharampur,
 
doing
 
agriculture
 
activities,
 
pest
 
spray,
 
masonry,
 
construction
 
activity,
 
wood
 
cutting,
 
and
 
daily
 
wage
 
labor.
 
They
 
return
 
in
 
between
 
at
 
the
 
interval
 
of
 
15
 
days.
 
During
 
Kharif
 
season,
 
June
 
to
 
October
 
they
 
pursue
 
agriculture
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
migrate
 
in
 
those
 
days.
 
If
 
there
 
are
 
more
 
than
 
two
 
adult
 
male
 
members
 
in
 
a
 
family
 
then
 
one
 
adult
 
male
 
member
 
of
 
the
 
family
 
is
 
highly
 
likely
 
to
 
migrate.
 
Around
 
10%
 
families
 
migrate
 
with
 
partners,
 
while
 
in
 
the
 
remaining
 
90%
 
of
 
families
 
only
 
male
 
members
 
could
 
migrate.

Villagers
 
depend
 
on
 
wood
 
from
 
agroforestry
 
trees
 
for
 
meeting
 
their
 
household
 
requirements.
 
Looking
 
at
 
the
 
median,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
inferred
 
that
 
people
 
residing
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
villages
 
spend
 
about
 
1
 
day
 
per
 
month
 
cutting
 
wood.
 
The
 
time
 
spent
 
on
 
cutting
 
wood
 
is
 
higher
 
in
 
Avdha
 
and
 
Hanmatmal
 
but
 
lower
 
in
 
village
 
Bopi.
 
They
 
report
 
spending
 
2
 
hours
 
per
 
day
 
on
 
this
 
activity.
 
However,
 
data
 
suggests
 
that
 
about
 
60%-70%
 
families
 
have
 
LPG
 
cylinders
 
as
 
well.
 
But
 
the
 
cost
 
of
 
reﬁlling
 
them
 
is
 
about
 
Rs.950
 
-
 
which
 
is
 
costly
 
and
 
so
 
most
 
families
 
do
 
depend
 
on
 
wood
 
to
 
supplement
 
their
 
cooking
 
fuel
 
requirements.
   
 
Inputs
 
from
  
traders
 
A
 
vegetable
 
Trader,
 
Mr.
 
Chandubhai
 
Tuljibhai
 
Raut
 
from
 
Hanmatmal
 
village
 
was
 
interviewed
 
to
 
get
 
his
 
insights
 
on
 
vegetable
 
trading
 
in
 
the
 
block
 
and
 
the
 
district.
 
Chandubhai
 
procures
 
and
 
sells
 
vegetables
 
in
 
and
 
around
 
Valsad
 
district.
 
He
 
sells
 
vegetables
 
and
 
mangoes
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
peak
 
production
 
months,
 
market
 
demand
 
and
 
price
 
margin.
 
He
 
has
 
two
 
pick
 
up
 
vans
 
which
 
travel
 
up
 
to
 
a
 
radius
 
of
 
18
 
Kms
 
per
 
day
 
for
 
the
 
procurement.
 
 
He
 
tells
 
during
 
the
 
Kharif
 
season,
 
June
 
to
 
October,
 
production
 
of
 
vegetables
 
per
 
farmer
 
ranges
 
between
 
5-7
 
Kgs
 
per
 
harvest.
 
With
 
this
 
small
 
quantity
 
and
 
higher
 
petrol
 
price,
 
the
 
transportation
 
becomes
 
costlier
 
in
 
turn
 
leading
 
to
 
lesser
 
proﬁts,
 
so
 
farmers
 
don’t
 
go
 
to
 
sell
 
in
 
APMC.
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
traders
 
so
 
the
 
trader
 
collects
 
vegetables
 
from
 
the
 
farmer's
 
home.
 
Even
 
with
 
less
 
36
 


 
quantity,
 
he
 
sells
 
them
 
to
 
local
 
markets
 
in
 
Vansda
 
and
 
Dharampur,
 
and
 
if
 
he
 
identiﬁes
 
higher
 
demands
 
or
 
better
 
price
 
valuation,
 
he
 
sells
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
markets
 
in
 
Surat,
 
Vadodara,
 
and
 
Ahmedabad.
 
Traders
 
collect
 
Bitter
 
gourd
 
and
 
Little
 
gourd
 
(Karela
 
and
 
Tindora)
 
from
 
nearby
 
villages
 
such
 
as
  
Ganva,
 
Ambrsi,
 
Bahutan,
 
and
 
Mamabhacha.
 
These
 
villages
 
are
 
within
 
5-7
 
kms
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
Hanumatmal
 
village.
 
He
 
roams
 
around
 
60
 
Kms
 
per
 
day
 
to
 
collect
 
vegetables
 
from
 
the
 
farmers
 
and
 
sell
 
them
 
in
 
Vansda
 
or
 
Gangpur
 
APMC.
 
A
 
few
 
farmers
 
in
 
Karjanpada
 
village
 
sell
 
Sponge
 
gourd
 
(Galka)
 
directly
 
in
 
Dharampur
 
APMC.
 
Chandubhai
 
says
 
traders
 
pay
 
to
 
the
 
farmers
 
as
 
per
 
weight
 
of
 
the
 
vegetables
 
collected,
 
quality
 
of
 
vegetables
 
and
 
vegetables
 
sorted
 
and
 
graded
 
according
 
to
 
their
 
size.
 
Price
 
valuation,
 
quality
 
examination,
 
sorting
 
and
 
grading
 
are
 
done
 
at
 
the
 
farmer's
 
home
 
itself
 
and
 
the
 
rejected
 
vegetables
 
are
 
returned
 
to
 
the
 
farmer
 
post
 
procurement.
 
He
 
further
 
adds,
 
“We
 
have
 
two
 
pickup
 
vans
 
for
 
transportation.
 
My
 
vans
 
pick
 
up
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis
 
700-900
 
kg
 
vegetables
 
and
 
sell
 
them
 
in
 
Vansda
 
APMC.
 
We
 
operate
 
on
 
low
 
proﬁt
 
margins,
 
procure
 
Bitter
 
gourd
 
at
 
Rs.15/kg
 
from
 
the
 
farmers
 
and
 
sell
 
it
 
at
 
Rs.16-17/kg
 
to
 
APMC.
 
The
 
cost
 
of
 
transportation
 
remains
 
around
 
Rs.2/Kg.
 
When
 
the
 
season
 
of
 
Okra,
 
Cluster
 
beans
 
and
 
Brinjal
 
ends,
 
we
 
start
 
collecting
 
mangoes
 
from
 
the
 
farmers.
 
Driver’s
 
monthly
 
salary
 
is
 
Rs.9,000
 
,
 
paying
 
Rs.
 
300
 
per
 
day
 
to
 
helper
 
staff
 
to
 
load
 
and
 
unload
 
vegetables
 
and
 
per
 
day
 
expense
 
of
 
diesel
 
is
 
around
 
Rs.1000.
 
Overall
 
the
 
proﬁt
 
margin
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
trading
 
points
 
of
 
sale,
 
as
 
in
 
to
 
APMCs
 
or
 
to
 
the
 
bigger
 
markets
 
in
 
Ahmedabad,
 
Surat
 
and
 
Valsad”.
 
He
 
explains
 
mango
 
price
 
valuation
 
by
 
telling
 
that
 
when
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
low
 
price
 
for
 
mangoes
 
in
 
the
 
market,
 
farmers
 
hold
 
the
 
produce
 
and
 
wait
 
for
 
the
 
price
 
to
 
increase
 
or
 
demand
 
high
 
price
 
from
 
the
 
traders.
 
On
 
the
 
other
 
side,
 
traders
 
are
 
aware
 
about
 
the
 
price
 
of
 
mango
 
in
 
the
 
APMC
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
pay
 
higher
 
prices
 
to
 
farmers
 
for
 
the
 
mango.
 
Traders
 
have
 
a
 
higher
 
bargaining
 
power
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
so
 
they
 
offer
 
only
 
lower
 
prices,
 
which
 
are
 
at
 
par
 
with
 
the
 
APMC
 
prices.
 
This
 
affects
 
the
 
farmers
 
a
 
lot
 
but
 
a
 
little
 
to
 
the
 
traders
 
as
 
they
 
obtain
 
a
 
decent
 
proﬁt
 
margin.
 
For
 
storage,
 
he
 
says
 
the
 
nearest
 
facility
 
available
 
is
 
in
 
Khanpur
 
village,
 
18
 
Kms
 
away
 
from
 
Hanumatmal
 
village.
 
Mangoes
 
can
 
be
 
stored
 
in
 
cold
 
storage
 
for
 
8-10
 
days
 
but
 
vegetables
 
like
 
Karela,
 
Tindora
 
and
 
Galka
 
can’t
 
be
 
stored
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
3-4
 
days.
 
Farmers
 
usually
 
cannot
 
bear
 
the
 
storage
 
expenses;
 
they
 
make
 
a
 
proﬁt
 
by
 
selling
 
a
 
lesser
 
quantity
 
of
 
vegetables,
 
however,
 
it
 
becomes
 
a
 
gamble
 
for
 
a
 
trader
 
at
 
times
 
to
 
store
 
and
 
expect
 
better
 
prices
 
in
 
the
 
future.
 
Pertaining
 
to
 
trade,
 
Chandubhai
 
informs
 
-
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
Kharif
 
season,
 
between
 
June
 
to
 
October,
 
ﬂowering
 
of
 
vegetables
 
doesn't
 
happen
 
well
 
and
 
results
 
in
 
low
 
production
 
of
 
vegetables.
 
Accordingly,
 
before
 
November,
 
we
 
sell
 
vegetables
 
in
 
Dharampur
 
APMC
 
or
 
Vansda
 
APMC.
 
During
 
and
 
after
 
(Bhindi
 
season)
 
November
 
month,
 
we
 
sell
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
vegetables
 
in
 
Ahmedabad,
 
in
 
bigger
 
trucks
  
or
 
Eicher.
 
On
 
an
 
average,
 
we
 
send
 
5
 
tons
 
of
 
vegetables/day
 
in
 
Ahmedabad
 
city.
 
We
 
collect
 
and
 
sell
 
Brinjal,
 
Cluster
 
beans
 
and
 
Flat
 
beans
 
(Baingan,
 
Guvar
 
and
 
Valod)
 
to
 
Ahmedabad.
 
In
 
Rabi
 
season
 
too,
 
we
 
trade
 
vegetables
 
to
 
Jamalpur
 
APMC
 
-
 
Ahmedabad
 
by
 
external
 
transport.
 
When
 
the
 
season
 
of
 
Okra,
 
Cluster
 
beans
 
and
 
Brinjal
 
ends,
 
we
 
start
 
collecting
 
mangoes
 
from
 
the
 
farmers.
 
Farmers
 
of
 
Bhavnagar,
 
Amreli
 
and
 
Ratnagiri,
 
Maharashtra,
 
usually
 
have
 
good
 
production
 
of
 
the
 
Kesar
 
variety
 
of
 
mango
 
which
 
they
 
sell
 
in
 
Valsad.
 
Before
 
the
 
COVID
 
lockdown,
 
an
 
export
 
agent
 
was
 
collecting
 
Sponge
 
gourd,
 
Little
 
gourd,
 
Bitter
 
gourd
 
(Galka,
 
Tindora,
 
Karela)
 
and
 
Mango
 
from
 
the
 
local
 
vegetable
 
traders.

When
 
asked
 
about
 
future
 
expectations
 
from
 
APMC
 
and
 
farmers
 
groups,
 
he
 
mentions
 
that
 
traders
 
haven’t
 
received
 
any
 
beneﬁt
 
or
 
subsidy
 
from
 
APMC/
 
government.
 
He
 
says
 
in
 
the
 
upcoming
 
two-three
 
years,
 
farmers
 
would
 
increase
 
the
 
sowing
 
area
 
of
 
creeper
 
vegetables
 
as
 
more
 
traders
 
are
 
directly
 
collecting
 
the
 
vegetables
 
from
 
their
 
homes.
 
An
 
APMC
 
can
 
be
 
developed
 
in
 
Hanumatmal.
 
If
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
farmer’s
 
group
 
(or
 
[Client
 
Project]
 
tukdi)
 
then
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
helpful
 
in
 
collecting
 
and
 
selling
 
vegetables
 
from
 
the
 
village.
 
The
 
group
 
can
 
store
 
mangoes
 
for
 
15
 
days
  
and
 
sell
 
the
 
mangoes,
 
when
 
they
 
get
 
a
 
higher
 
price.

Community
 
Institutions
 
99.44%
 
respondents
 
told
 
of
 
not
 
being
 
a
 
member
 
of
 
any
 
FPO
 
or
 
cooperative
 
even
 
though
 
18.99%
 
respondents
 
claimed
 
that
 
they
 
knew
 
of
 
the
 
existence
 
of
 
a
 
FPO/
 
FIG/
 
cooperative
 
in
 
their
 
village/
 
block.
 
Thus,
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
conclusive
 
evidence
 
to
 
prove
 
that
 
a
 
functioning
 
FPO
 
exists
 
in
 
the
 
village.
 
In
 
such
 
a
 
scenario,
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
proposes
 
a
 
good
 
model
 
for
 
business
 
by
 
organising
 
the
 
farmers
 
into
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
tukdis
 
ﬁrstly,
 
which
 
will
 
then
 
merge
 
to
 
form
 
village
 
development
 
committees
 
(VDCs)
 
at
 
the
 
village
 
level
 
which
 
eventually
 
will
 
be
 
linked
 
to
 
the
 
FPOs
 
like
 
Pindval
 
Cooperative
 
and
 
VAPCOL
 
for
 
backward/
 
forward
 
linkages
 
and
 
marketing
 
of
 
produce
 
respectively.
 
 
Given
 
the
 
pivotal
 
role
 
of
 
community
 
institutions
 
like
 
FPOs
 
in
 
making
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
sustainable,
 
the
 
following
 
recommendations
 
could
 
be
 
useful
 
from
 
the
 
perspective
 
of
 
strengthening
 
community
 
institutions:
 
a)
 
Firstly,
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
institutionalization
 
needs
 
to
 
begin
 
from
 
the
 
time
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
starts
 
(and
 
not
 
after
 
some
 
years
 
when
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
trees
 
start
 
fruiting).
 
This
 
is
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
community
 
understands
 
why
 
an
 
FPO
 
is
 
needed,
 
how
 
the
 
model
 
works
 
and
 
what’s
 
in
 
it
 
for
 
them.
 
The
 
FPO
 
can
 
start
 
with
 
dealing
 
in
 
input
 
supply
 
to
 
get
 
started.
 
 
b)
 
Secondly,
 
the
 
FPO
 
formed
 
should
 
not
 
deal
 
exclusively
 
in
 
horticultural
 
produce
 
from
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers,
 
but
 
should
 
trade
 
in
 
other
 
crops
 
and
 
include
 
non-[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
farmers
 
as
 
well.
 
Diversiﬁcation
 
of
 
produce
 
traded
 
and
 
income
 
sources
 
hedges
 
the
 
FPO
 
against
 
risks
 
associated
 
with
 
particular
 
commodities
 
and
 
increased
  
farmer
 
membership
 
base
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
FPO
 
caters
 
to
 
all
 
people
 
of
 
the
 
region.

Women’s
 
Participation
 
17.88%
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
respondents
 
in
 
the
 
sample
 
were
 
women
 
(i.e.
 
32)
 
and
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
were
 
actively
 
involved
 
in
 
farming
 
activities
 
like
 
land
 
preparation,
 
sowing
 
and
 
harvesting.
 
However,
 
only
 
43.75%
 
of
 
these
 
32
 
women
 
claimed
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
involved
 
in
 
marketing
 
and
 
selling
 
of
 
produce.
 
Fewer
 
still
 
(25.00%)
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
migrate
 
for
 
labor
 
work.
 
Also,
 
25.00%,
 
9.38%
 
and
 
12.50%
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
attended
 
capacity
 
building
 
sessions
 
on
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT],
 
went
 
on
 
exposure
 
visits
 
for
 
the
 
same
 
and
 
attended
 
mixed
 
gender
 
meetings
 
respectively.
 
Their
 
contribution
 
to
 
decision
 
making
 
is

Women’s
 
participation

From
 
the
 
above
 
graph,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
seen
 
that
 
while
 
most
 
women
 
claim
 
to
 
be
 
empowered
 
enough
 
to
 
contribute
 
in
 
decision
 
making,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
case
 
for
 
every
 
one.
 
 
Inputs
 
were
 
gathered
 
on
 
different
 
aspects
 
of
 
women’s
 
livelihood
 
from
 
the
 
2
 
focus
 
group
 
discussions
 
conducted,
 
which
 
are
 
as
 
elaborated
 
below:
 
 
a)
 
Ownership
 
and
 
awareness
 
of
 
assets:
 
Around
 
40%
 
of
 
the
 
32
 
women
 
legally
 
own
 
the
 
land
 
as
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
inheritance
 
and
 
are
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
land.
 
The
 
challenge
 
was
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
dimensions
 
to
 
report.
 
b)
 
Decisions
 
in
 
farming
 
activities:
 
In
 
both
 
the
 
FGDs,
 
the
 
farming
 
decisions
 
are
 
followed
 
as
  
traditional
 
practices
 
to
 
grow,
 
labour
 
and
 
sale.
 
It
 
seems
 
they
 
are
 
consensual
 
decisions
 
and
 
rarely
 
get
 
into
 
conﬂicts.
 
Women
 
said
 
their
 
family
 
members
 
understand
 
the
 
value
 
in
 
their
 
judgement
 
and
 
make
 
decisions
 
towards
 
a
 
better
 
outcome.
 
Mostly
 
men
 
go
 
to
 
Dharampur
 
or
 
Valsad
 
as
 
a
 
combined
 
group
 
in
 
Jeep
 
to
 
sell
 
their
 
produce,
 
be
 
it
 
mangoes
 
or
 
vegetables.
 
Due
 
to
 
water
 
shortage,
 
only
 
a
 
few
 
families
 
(3
 
to
 
4)
 
grow
 
vegetables
  
and
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
are
 
rearing
 
livestock.
 
c)
 
Decisions
 
on
 
education:
 
The
 
education
 
levels
 
of
 
women
 
who
 
participated
 
in
 
the
 
FGDs
 
ranged
 
from
 
being
 
illiterate
 
to
 
studying
 
till
 
12th
 
standard.
 
They
 
send
 
their
 
children
 
to
 
school
 
till
 
12th
 
std
 
in
 
a
 
vicinity
 
of
 
6-8
 
kms
 
and
 
women
 
actively
 
voice
 
their
 
opinions
  
for
 
children’s
 
education
 
and
 
family
 
members
 
support
 
the
 
children’s
 
education.
 
 
d)
 
Decisions
 
on
 
health
 
:
 
Subcenter
 
is
 
one
 
kilometer
 
away
 
from
 
BOPI
 
village
 
and
 
Primary
 
Health
 
Center
 
is
 
in
 
Dharampur
 
22
 
Kms
 
away.
 
In
 
the
 
s
ub
 
center,
 
they
 
can
 
get
 
medicine
 
for
 
the
 
illnesses
 
of
 
small
 
children
 
such
 
as
 
fever,
 
seasonal
 
ﬂu
 
and
 
common
 
cold.
 
They
 
take
 
active
 
decisions
 
on
 
children’s
 
health
 
and
 
family
 
members’
 
health
 
with
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
of
  
Aangan[Client
 
Project]
 
and
 
ASHA
 
workers.
 
39
 


 
They
 
are
 
actively
 
engaged
 
by
 
frontline
 
healthcare
 
workers
 
to
 
be
 
aware
 
about
 
sexual
 
and
 
reproductive
 
hygiene,
 
menstrual
 
health
 
and
 
using
 
sanitary
 
pads.
 
Family
 
members
 
support
 
them
 
to
 
make
 
independent
 
decisions
 
on
 
healthcare,
 
such
 
as
 
women
 
buying
 
sanitary
 
pads
 
from
 
shops
 
or
 
addressing
 
taboos
 
around
 
it.
 
e)
 
Women’s
 
Transportation
 
:
 
Women
 
and
 
girls
 
commute
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
by
 
bu
s
 
if
 
a
 
private
 
vehicle
 
is
 
not
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
family.

Comparative
 
analysis
 
of
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
 
From
 
the
 
above
 
table,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
inferred
 
that
 
the
 
average
 
land
 
holding
 
and
 
income
 
per
 
acre
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
is
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
comparison
 
group.
 
The
 
average
 
irrigated
 
land
 
holding
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
is
 
also
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
comparison
 
group,
 
which
 
is
 
in
 
alignment
 
with
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
migration
 
rate
 
is
 
lower
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
 
Ownership
 
of
 
assets
  
like
 
electricity
 
and
 
farming
 
land
 
is
 
similar
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
while
 
LPG
 
stove
 
connections
 
are
 
higher
 
in
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
but
 
smartphone
 
penetration
 
lower
 
(as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
treatment
 
group).
 
The
 
presence
 
of
 
Agroforestry
 
(prior
 
to
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
intervention)
 
is
 
also
 
equivalent
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
groups.
 
Also,
 
overall,
 
there
 
are
 
more
 
number
 
of
 
people
 
below
 
the
 
poverty
 
line
 
for
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
than
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
     
 
Different
 
methods
 
like
 
Difference-in-Differences
 
(DID),
 
Propensity
 
Score
 
Matching
 
(PSM)
 
or
 
Instrumental
 
Variables
 
(IV)
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
evaluating
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project's
 
impact
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
similarity
 
of
 
characteristics
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
of
 
people.
 
Based
 
on
 
the
 
qualitative
 
and
 
quantitative
 
evidence
 
collected
 
at
 
the
 
baseline,
 
DID
 
is
 
ruled
 
out
 
(since
 
parallel
 
trends
 
assumption
 
is
 
not
 
met)
 
while
 
other
 
methods
 
like
 
PSM
 
or
 
IV
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
impact
 
evaluation.

Limitations
              
 
Some
 
limitations
 
that
 
hindered
 
the
 
effective
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
baseline
 
study
 
of
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
are
 
as
 
follows
 
:
 
a)
 
The
 
t-test
 
conducted
 
for
 
checking
 
the
 
similarity
 
of
 
characteristics
 
between
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups
 
indicates
 
that
 
there
 
are
 
signiﬁcant
 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
groups.
 
Also,
 
qualitative
 
inputs
 
received
 
from
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION]
 
-
 
that
 
the
 
people
 
in
 
comparison
 
villages
 
have
 
lesser
 
privately
 
owned
 
land
 
and
 
are
 
under
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
the
 
42
 


 
Satipati
 
cult
 
-
 
provide
 
further
 
clues
 
that
 
substantiate
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
are
 
not
 
comparable.
 
A
 
limitation
 
posed
 
by
 
this
 
fact
 
is
 
that
 
given
 
that
 
the
 
two
 
groups
 
are
 
dissimilar,
 
impact
 
evaluation
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
at
 
the
 
endline
 
using
 
the
 
Difference-in-Differences
 
methodology
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
possible
 
since
 
these
 
groups
 
do
 
not
 
satisfy
 
the
 
parallel
 
trends
 
assumption.
 
In
 
this
 
case,
 
other
 
methods
 
like
 
IV
 
or
 
PSM
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
employed
 
for
 
impact
 
evaluation
 
with
 
the
 
data
 
collected
 
at
 
the
 
baseline
 
for
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
being
 
rendered
 
useless.
 
 
 
b)
 
The
 
women's
 
representation
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
sampled
 
stands
 
at
 
17.88%
  
in
 
the
 
baseline
 
in
 
contrast
 
to
 
the
 
25%
 
mentioned
 
in
 
the
 
inception
 
report.
 
This
 
is
 
because
 
even
 
though
 
25%
 
women
 
were
 
surveyed
 
overall
 
(for
 
both
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
group
 
taken
 
together);
 
of
 
these
 
25%,
 
61.90%
 
were
 
from
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
while
 
38.10%
 
women
 
were
 
from
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
 
However,
 
we
 
have
 
tried
 
to
 
overcome
 
this
 
limitation
 
by
 
effectively
 
capturing
 
women’s
 
voices
 
and
 
opinions
 
through
 
qualitative
 
methods
 
like
 
focussed
 
group
 
discussions.
  
 
 
c)
 
Secondary
 
data
 
for
 
reference
 
has
 
been
 
taken
 
from
 
multiple
 
sources
 
like
 
the
 
project
 
proposal,
 
MoU
 
and
 
other
 
such
 
documents
 
shared
 
by
 
[CLIENT
 
ORGANIZATION].
 
The
 
statistics
 
from
 
these
 
sources
 
were
 
used
 
for
 
comparison
 
with
 
the
 
baseline
 
ﬁndings.
 
Overall,
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
index
 
developed
5
,
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
better-off
 
than
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
while
 
the
 
district
 
seems
 
to
 
have
 
progressed
 
way
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
entire
 
sample
 
surveyed.
 
Since
 
the
 
latest
 
DPR
 
for
 
the
 
[CLIENT
 
PROJECT]
 
project
 
was
 
not
 
available
 
for
 
reference,
 
the
 
baseline
 
ﬁndings
 
of
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
control
 
villages
 
have
 
been
 
compared
 
with
 
the
 
indicators
 
of
 
the
 
district.
 
Thus,
 
it
 
cannot
 
be
 
conclusively
 
established
 
if
 
the
 
region
 
is
 
doing
 
better
 
or
 
worse
 
than
 
itself
 
over
 
time.
 
Readers
 
need
 
to
 
exercise
 
caution
 
and
 
be
 
mindful
 
of
 
this
 
limitation
 
while
 
drawing
 
inferences
 
from
 
this
 
report.
 
 
 
Also,
 
the
 
parallel
 
trends
 
assumption
 
which
 
needs
 
to
 
hold
 
if
 
DID
 
is
 
to
 
be
 
used
 
for
 
evaluating
 
impact
 
can
 
be
 
effectively
 
validated
 
only
 
if
 
the
 
latest
 
secondary
 
data
 
is
 
available.
 
Given
 
that
 
the
 
latest
 
data
 
is
 
not
 
available,
 
it
 
becomes
 
difﬁcult
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
baseline
 
data
 
for
 
this
 
assumption
 
thus
 
this
 
becomes
 
a
 
severe
 
limitation.
 
 
 
d)
 
Some
 
bias
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
could
 
be
 
introduced
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
inherent
 
lack
 
of
 
knowledge
 
among
 
women
 
about
 
information
 
related
 
to
 
landholding,
 
income
 
and
 
expenses
 
(household,
 
agricultural
 
and
 
others).
 
Women
 
needed
 
considerable
 
help
 
from
 
their
 
male
 
counterparts
 
while
 
answering
 
questions
 
requiring
 
numeric
 
responses.
 
In
 
such
 
a
 
scenario,
 
while
 
initially
 
we
 
let
 
the
 
men
 
help
 
the
 
women
 
and
 
told
 
them
 
to
 
step
 
aside
 
when
 
questions
 
related
 
to
 
women
 
empowerment
 
were
 
asked;
 
later
 
we
 
let
 
the
 
women
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
entire
 
survey
 
without
 
any
 
interference
 
from
 
men
 
and
 
captured
 
their
 
responses
 
as
 
they
 
were.

Note
 
on
 
Difference-in-Differences
 
Difference-in-differences
 
compares
 
the
 
changes
 
in
 
outcomes
 
over
 
time
 
between
 
units
 
that
 
are
 
enrolled
 
in
 
a
 
program
 
(the
 
treatment
 
group)
 
and
 
units
 
that
 
are
 
not
 
(the
 
comparison
 
group).
 
This
 
47
 


 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
correct
 
for
 
any
 
differences
 
between
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups
 
that
 
are
 
constant
 
over
 
time.
 
Instead
 
of
 
comparing
 
outcomes
 
between
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups
 
after
 
the
 
intervention,
 
the
 
difference-in-differences
 
method
 
compares
 
trends
 
between
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups.
 
This
 
method
 
takes
 
the
 
before-after
 
difference
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
group’s
 
outcomes.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
difference.
 
In
 
comparing
 
the
 
same
 
group
 
to
 
itself,
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
difference
 
controls
 
for
 
factors
 
that
 
are
 
constant
 
over
 
time
 
in
 
that
 
group.
 
Then,
 
to
 
capture
 
time-varying
 
factors,
 
difference-in-differences
 
takes
 
the
 
before-after
 
difference
 
in
 
the
 
control
 
group,
 
which
 
was
 
exposed
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
set
 
of
 
environmental
 
conditions
 
as
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
second
 
difference.
 
Finally,
 
difference-in-differences
 
“cleans”
 
all
 
time-varying
 
factors
 
from
 
the
 
ﬁrst
 
difference
 
by
 
subtracting
 
the
 
second
 
difference
 
from
 
it.
 
This
 
leaves
 
us
 
with
 
the
 
impact
 
estimation
 
–
 
or
 
the
 
difference-in-differences.
 
The
 
Parallel
 
trends
 
assumption
 
For
 
obtaining
 
an
 
unbiased
 
DID
 
estimate,
 
it
 
is
 
imperative
 
to
 
test
 
for
 
the
 
parallel
 
or
 
equal
 
trends
  
assumption.
 
This
 
means
 
without
 
treatment,
 
outcomes
 
would
 
need
 
to
 
increase
 
or
 
decrease
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
rate
 
in
 
both
 
the
 
groups.
 
In
 
other
 
words,
 
the
 
parallel
 
trends
 
assumption
 
states
 
that,
 
although
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups
 
may
 
have
 
different
 
levels
 
of
 
the
 
outcome
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
treatment,
 
their
 
trends
 
in
 
pre-treatment
 
outcomes
 
should
 
be
 
the
 
same.
 
If
 
outcome
 
trends
 
are
 
different
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups,
 
then
 
the
 
estimated
 
treatment
 
effect
 
obtained
 
by
 
difference-in-differences
 
method
 
would
 
be
 
invalid,
 
or
 
biased.
 
That’s
 
because
 
the
 
trend
 
for
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
valid
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
counterfactual
 
trend
 
that
 
would
 
have
 
prevailed
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
in
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
the
 
program.
  
If
 
in
 
reality
 
outcomes
 
for
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
grow
 
more
 
slowly
 
than
 
outcomes
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
in
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
the
 
program,
 
using
 
the
 
trend
 
for
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
as
 
an
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
counterfactual
 
of
 
the
 
trend
 
for
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
leads
 
to
 
a
 
biased
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
program’s
 
impact;
 
more
 
speciﬁcally,
 
we
 
would
 
overestimate
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
 
Note
 
on
 
Propensity
 
Score
 
Matching
 
Propensity
 
Score
 
Matching
 
is
 
an
 
impact
 
evaluation
 
technique
 
that
 
essentially
 
uses
 
statistical
 
methods
 
to
 
construct
 
an
 
artiﬁcial
 
comparison
 
group.
 
For
 
every
 
possible
 
unit
 
under
 
treatment,
 
it
 
attempts
 
to
 
ﬁnd
 
a
 
nontreatment
 
unit
 
(or
 
set
 
of
 
nontreatment
 
units)
 
that
 
has
 
the
 
most
 
similar
 
characteristics
 
possible.
 
Matching
 
methods
 
enable
 
you
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
set
 
of
 
non-enrolled
 
individuals
 
that
 
look
 
most
 
similar
 
to
 
the
 
treated
 
individuals,
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
characteristics
 
that
 
are
 
available
 
in
 
your
 
data
 
set.
 
These
 
matched
 
non-enrolled
 
individuals
 
then
 
become
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
estimate
 
the
 
counterfactual.
 
Finding
 
a
 
good
 
match
 
for
 
each
 
program
 
participant
 
requires
 
approximating
 
as
 
closely
 
as
 
possible
 
the
 
characteristics
 
that
 
explain
 
that
 
individual
 
decision
 
to
 
enroll
 
in
 
the
 
program.
  
 
In
 
PSM,
 
for
 
each
 
unit
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
pool
 
of
 
non-enrolled,
 
we
 
compute
 
the
 
probability
 
that
 
this
 
unit
 
will
 
enroll
 
in
 
the
 
program
 
(the
 
so-called
 
propensity
 
score)
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
observed
 
values
 
of
 
its
 
characteristics
 
(the
 
explanatory
 
variables).
 
This
 
score
 
is
 
a
 
real
 
number
 
between
 
0
 
and
 
1
 
that
 
summarizes
 
the
 
inﬂuence
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
observed
 
characteristics
 
on
 
the
 
48
 


 
likelihood
 
of
 
enrolling
 
in
 
the
 
program.
 
Once
 
the
 
propensity
 
score
 
has
 
been
 
computed
 
for
 
all
 
units,
 
then
 
units
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
group
 
can
 
be
 
matched
 
with
 
units
 
in
 
the
 
pool
 
of
 
non-enrolled
 
that
 
have
 
the
 
closest
 
propensity
 
score.
 
These
 
closest
 
units
 
become
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
and
 
are
 
used
 
to
 
produce
 
an
 
estimate
 
of
 
the
 
counterfactual.
 
The
 
propensity
 
score–matching
 
method
 
tries
 
to
 
mimic
 
the
 
randomized
 
assignment
 
to
 
treatment
 
and
 
comparison
 
groups
 
by
 
choosing
 
for
 
the
 
comparison
 
group
 
those
 
units
 
that
 
have
 
similar
 
propensities
 
to
 
the
 
units
 
in
 
the
 
treatment
 
group.
 
The
 
average
 
difference
 
in
 
outcomes
 
between
 
the
 
treatment
 
or
 
enrolled
 
units
 
and
 
their
 
matched
 
comparison
 
units
 
produces
 
the
 
estimated
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
program.
 
In
 
summary,
 
the
 
program’s
 
impact
 
is
 
estimated
 
by
 
comparing
 
the
 
average
 
outcomes
 
of
 
a
 
treatment
 
or
 
enrolled
 
group
 
and
 
the
 
average
 
outcomes
 
among
 
a
 
statistically
 
matched
 
subgroup
 
of
 
units,
 
the
 
match
 
being
 
based
 
on
 
observed
 
characteristics
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
data
 
at
 
hand.

The
 
Apparel
 
sector
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
biggest
 
contributors
 
of
 
air
 
and
 
water
 
pollution
 
both
 
at
 
the
 
pre

post-consumer
 
stages;
 
the
 
massive
 
size
 
(Bauer
 
&amp;
 
Jagasia,
 
2019)
 
of
 
the
 
sector
 
exaggerates
 
the
 
problem
 
further .
 
Current
 
apparel
 
supply
 
chain
 
is
 
not
 
sustainable
 
owing
 
to
 
its
 
linear
 
(Centre
 
for
 
Responsible
 
Business
 
&amp;
 
Novozymes)
 
nature
 
and
 
has
 
proven
 
to
 
be
 
extremely
 
resource
 
intensive
 
and
 
inefficient
 
(Kenniskaarten).
 
They
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
transparent
 
traceability
 
mechanisms
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
uniformly
 
applied
 
across
 
the
 
sector
 
-
 
thereby
 
compromising
 
on
 
the
 
sustainability
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
ethical
 
standards
 
of
 
garment
 
production.
 
Traceability
 
in
 
the
 
apparel
 
sector
 
becomes
 
all
 
the
 
more
 
important
 
since
 
the
 
lifecycle
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
right
 
from
 
raw
 
material
 
to
 
post-consumer
 
waste,
 
travels
 
across
 
multiple
 
geographies,
 
manufacturing
 
sites
 
and
 
agents,
 
and
 
very
 
often
 
traverses
 
opaque
 
and
 
distrustful
 
networks.
 
(Patel,
 
Thomas,
 
&amp;
 
Pore,
 
2018).”
 
Across
 
the
 
globe,
 
the
 
shift
 
to
 
circular
 
models
 
have
 
emerged
 
as
 
the
 
solution
 
to
 
the
 
challenges
 
in
 
the
 
current
 
supply
 
chain
 
for
 
improved
 
resource
 
utilization,
 
and
 
reduction
 
in
 
pollution.
 
 
The
 
transition,
 
though
 
inevitable,
 
lacks
 
empirical
 
evidence
 
around
 
the
 
strategic
 
shifts
 
for
 
incorporating
 
circular
 
supply
 
chains
 
models.
 
Uncertainty
 
around
 
the
 
implication
 
for
 
stakeholders,
 
consumer
 
behaviors,
 
reduction
 
in
 
production
 
add
 
to
 
barriers
 
towards
 
regenerative
 
change.
 
The
 
entire
 
idea
 
of
 
circularity
 
in
 
the
 
apparel
 
sector
 
is
 
nascent
 
for
 
South
 
Asian
 
production
 
countries
 
like
 
India.
 
Policies
 
in
 
these
 
nations
 
are
 
focused
 
on
 
addressing
 
manufacturing
 
challenges
 
like
 
those
 
of
 
infrastructure,
 
automation
 
etc.,
 
not
 
realizing
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
a
 
strategic
 
shift
 
in
 
perspective
 
towards
 
their
 
businesses.
 
 
International
 
non-profits,
 
foundations
 
and
 
civil
 
society
 
organizations
 
have
 
triggered
 
the
 
conversation
 
in
 
the
 
global
 
west
 
with
 
some
 
replicable
 
and
 
scalable
 
pilots.
 
However ,
 
efforts
 
towards
 
transition
 
in
 
South
 
Asian
 
production
 
nations
 
are
 
still
 
new,
 
without
 
support
 
from
 
the
 
government
 
so
 
far.
 
 


Desk
 
Research
 
In
 
the
 
age
 
of
 
rising
 
consumerism,
 
the
 
idea
 
of
 
casual
 
purchasing
 
has
 
picked
 
up
 
and
 
is
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
‘retail
 
therapy’.
 
While
 
added
 
social
 
desires
 
and
 
identity
 
connotations
 
to
 
clothing
 
have
 
driven
 
the
 
fast
 
fashion
 
trend,
 
it
 
has
 
only
 
resulted
 
in
 
damaging
 
consequences
 
for
 
the
 
environment
 
(Armstrong,,
 
Niinimaki,
 
Lang,
 
&amp;
 
Kujala,
 
2016).
 
Present
 
supply
 
chain
 
of
 
‘take-make-dispose’
 
relies
 
on
 
cheap
 
and
 
easily
 
available
 
inputs
 
which
 
are
 
wasteful
 
and
 
unsustainable
 
in
 
nature
 
and
 
has
 
led
 
to
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
closing
 
the
 
loop
 
for
 
resource
 
efficiency
 
and
 
minimizing
 
pollution
 
(Jørgensen,
 
Jacob,
 
&amp;
 
Pedersen,
 
2018).
 
 
The
 
Ellen
 
MacArthur
 
Foundation
 
(EMF)
 
highlighted
 
that
 
circular
 
economy
 
emphasizes
 
on
 
product,
 
component
 
and
 
material
 
reuse,
 
refurbishment,
 
remanufacturing,
 
repair
 
and
 
upgrading
 
to
 
alternative
 
energy
 
sources
 
throughout
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
(Ellen
 
Macarthur
 
Foundation,
 
2013;
 
Centre
 
for
 
Responsible
 
Business
 
&amp;
 
Novozymes).
 
Industry
 
leaders
 
and
 
policy
 
makers
 
have
 
pioneered
 
the
 
circular
 
economy
 
approach
 
within
 
the
 
apparel
 
and
 
textile
 
sector
 
for
 
making
 
it
 
more
 
resource
 
efficient
 
and
 
sustainable.
 
Engagement
 
in
 
sustainability
 
has
 
deepened
 
during
 
the
 
COVID-19
 
crisis,
 
with
 
European
 
consumers
 
wanting
 
fashion
 
players
 
to
 
act
 
responsibly
 
and
 
consider
 
the
 
social
 
and
 
environmental
 
impacts
 
of
 
their
 
businesses.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
65
 
percent
 
of
 
respondents
 
are
 
planning
 
to
 
purchase
 
more
 
durable
 
fashion
 
items,
 
and
 
71
 
percent
 
are
 
planning
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
items
 
they
 
already
 
have
 
for
 
longer
 
(Granskog,
 
Lee,
 
Magnus,
 
&amp;
 
Sawers,
 
2020).
 
Studies
 
across
 
the
 
world
 
have
 
time
 
and
 
again
 
surfaced
 
consumers
 
attitudes
 
towards
 
their
 
willingness
 
to
 
adopt
 
circular
 
models.
 
In
 
a
 
2019
 
global
 
survey
 
(Amed,
 
et
 
al.,
 
2019),
 
industry
 
respondents
 
said
 
that
 
pre-owned
 
goods
 
and
 
rental
 
goods
 
were
 
44
 
percent
 
and
 
41
 
percent
 
more
 
relevant
 
in
 
fashion,
 
respectively .
 
Numbers
 
for
 
the
 
resale
 
industry
 
also
 
indicate
 
25
 
times
 
faster
 
growth
 
than
 
the
 
overall
 
retail
 
industry
 
in
 
2019-with
 
5
 
times
 
more
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
5
 
years.
 
Similarly ,
 
the
 
markets
 
for
 
secondhand
 
garment
 
are
 
projected
 
to
 
produce
 
twice
 
the
 
current
 
market,
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
5
 
years.
 
A
 
ThredUp
 
study
 
(Thred
 
Up,
 
2020)
 
found
 
that
 
64%
 
percent
 
of
 
women
 
bought
 
or
 
are
 
willing
 
to
 
buy
 
resold
 
fashion
 
pieces.
 
This
 
trend
 
is
 
being
 
intensified
 
by
 
COVID-19.
 
 
While
 
the
 
west
 
is
 
gradually
 
adopting
 
more
 
circular
 
models
 
in
 
their
 
operations,
 
India
 
and
 
other
 
manufacturing
 
countries
 
of
 
South
 
Asia
 
lack
 
the
 
business
 
outlook
 
and
 
policy
 
push.
 
A
 
CRB
 
study
 
(Centre
 
for
 
Responsible
 
Business
 
&amp;
 
Novozymes)
 
highlights
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
understanding
 
of
 
circular
 
economy
 
by
 
Indian
 
manufacturers
 
and
 
suppliers-‘circularity
 
being
 
used
 
interchangeably
 
with
 
general
 
sustainability
 
and
 
environmental
 
measures.’
 
The
 
study
 
further
 
highlights
 
that
 
government
 
policies
 
have
 
not
 
yet
 
focused
 
on
 
providing
 
infrastructural
 
support
 
for
 
incentivizing
 
waste
 
management
 
to
 
begin
 
with.
 
 
On
 
the
 
one
 
hand,
 
the
 
shift
 
is
 
bolstered
 
by
 
a
 
declining
 
preference
 
for
 
&quot;newness&quot;;
 
while
 
on
 
the
 
other ,
 
consumer
 
behavior
 
in
 
India
 
and
 
other
 
South
 
Asian
 
countries
 
is
 
not
 
reflected.
 
Consumer
 
preference
 
in
 
these
 
countries
 
is
 
driven
 
by
 
“aspiration-based
 
buying”
 
rather
 
than
 
“need-
 
based”
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
increase
 
in
 
incomes
 
of
 
the
 
domestic
 
consumer
 
and
 
growing
 
market
 
(Invest
 
India,
 
2020)
 

Additionally ,
 
transition
 
to
 
new
 
modes
 
of
 
production
 
and
 
incorporation
 
of
 
new
 
materials
 
further
 
opens
 
a
 
window
 
for
 
apprehension
 
among
 
all
 
players
 
in
 
the
 
supply
 
chain,
 
making
 
information
 
dissemination
 
key
 
to
 
retaining
 
the
 
trust
 
of
 
stakeholders
 
one
 
is
 
transacting
 
(Fung
 
Global
 
Institute,
 
2013).
 
In
 
a
 
recent
 
survey
 
(Mckinsey ,
 
2019)
 
conducted
 
by
 
McKinsey
 
52
 
percent
 
of
 
millennials
 
and
 
45
 
percent
 
of
 
Gen
 
Z
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
always
 
research
 
for
 
background
 
information
 
before
 
buying
 
a
 
product,
 
implying
 
how
 
transparency
 
in
 
the
 
supply
 
chain
 
will
 
become
 
core
 
to
 
business
 
operations.
 
 
However ,
 
“radical
 
transparency”
 
may
 
also
 
lead
 
to
 
challenges
 
related
 
to
 
disclosure
 
of
 
trade
 
secrets
 
like
 
those
 
of
 
pricing.
 
Although
 
end-to-end
 
product
 
traceability
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
enabler
 
in
 
mainstreaming
 
circularity
 
in
 
the
 
industry ,
 
the
 
growth
 
of
 
misinformation
 
may
 
make
 
it
 
difficult
 
for
 
brands
 
to
 
control
 
their
 
online
 
presence
 
and
 
for
 
consumers
 
to
 
ascertain
 
the
 
truth
  
from
 
the
 
fake,
 
contrarily
 
eroding
 
the
 
trust
 
placed
 
in
 
brands.

Results
 
The
 
understanding
 
of
 
circularity
 
in
 
India
 
has
 
largely
 
been
 
restricted
 
to
 
post-consumer
 
waste
 
for
 
a
 
long
 
time.
 
However ,
 
for
 
India,
 
being
 
a
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
recycling
 
economy ,
 
the
 
implications
 
were
 
a
 
lot
 
more.
 
Devyani
 
Hari
 
from
 
Centre
 
for
 
Responsible
 
Business
 
explained
 
how
 
the
 
policy
 
landscape
 
in
 
India
 
has
 
been
 
slow
 
to
 
capitalize
 
on
 
the
 
circular
 
transition
 
in
 
the
 
apparel
 
sector .
 
The
 
misalignment
 
between
 
policies
 
at
 
the
 
state
 
and
 
center ,
 
irregular
 
change
 
in
 
regulations,
 
lack
 
of
 
incentives
 
for
 
manufacturers
 
and
 
implementation
 
challenges
 
have
 
impeded
 
transition
 
at
 
multiple
 
levels.
 
 
Stakeholders
 
across
 
the
 
value
 
chain
 
highlighted
 
how
 
India
 
has
 
always
 
had
 
a
 
rich
 
culture
 
of
 
recycling,
 
tailoring,
 
and
 
upcycling
 
garments.
 
The

fashion
 
impact
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
those

in
 
the
 
conventional
 
garment
 
production.
 
The
 
worker
 
surveys
 
and
 
key
 
informant
 
interviews
 
focused
 
on
 
gathering
 
insights
 
on
 
the
 
current
 
state,
 
challenges,
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
job
 
for
 
traditional

and
 
recommendations
 
for
 
smooth
 
and
 
inclusive
 
transition.
 
 
Job
 
Demand
 
This
 
section
 
focuses
 
on
 
understanding
 
the
 
physical,
 
emotional,
 
and
 
financial
 
requirements
 
of
 
the
 
current
 
job
 
that
 
the
 
workers
 
are
 
involved
 
in.
 
 
Majority
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
(80%)
 
perceive
 
a
 
threat
 
to
 
their
 
safety
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
job
 
however
 
only
 
46%
 
acknowledged
 
wearing
 
safety
 
gear.
 
Female
 
workers
 
perceived
 
a
 
higher
 
threat
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
men.
 
Most
 
workers
 
(&gt;85%)
 
had
 
knowledge
 
about
 
the
 
Internal
 
Complaints
 
Committee
 
(ICC)
 
but
 
lacked
 
clarity
 
regarding
 
the
 
processes
 
and
 
procedures
 
to
 
be
 
followed.
 
Even
 
the
 
ones
 
who
 
claimed
 
to
 
be
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
processes
 
seem
 
to
 
access
 
it
 
only
 
their
 
supervisors.
 
Factory
 
units
 
have
 
installed
 
secret
 
ballots
 
for
 
workers
 
to
 
submit
 
their
 
complaints,
 
but
 
the
 
ecosystem
 
is
 
not
 
enabling
 
enough
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
with
 
less
 
hesitance.
 
Perception
 
of
 
workers
 
related
 
to
 
safety
 
at
 
work
 
has
 
been
 
negative,
 
with
 
47%
 
workers
 
reported
 
having
 
experienced
 
threat
 
to
 
their
 
safety
 
‘
many
 
times
’.
 
Female
 
garment
 
workers
 
recorded
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
28%
 
“yes,
 
many
 
times”
 
and
 
9%
 
responding
 
to
 
“yes,
 
few
 
times”.
 
 
A
 
total
 
of
 
43%
 
workers
 
in
 
the
 
recycling
 
sector
 
recorded
 
high
 
risk
 
of
 
accidents
 
in
 
their
 
jobs
 
with
 
28%
 
male
 
and
 
15%
 
females’
 
workers.
 
This
 
was
 
followed
 
by
 
28%
 
workers
 
recording
 
exposure
 
to
 
noise
 
and
 
vibration
 
as
 
the
 
second
 
highest
 
risk.
 
Female
 
respondents
 
in
 
the
 
recycling
 
category
 
recorded
 
equal
 
risk
 
of
 
accidents
 
and
 
exposure
 
to
 
potentially
 
dangerous
 
chemicals
 
at
 
15%
 
each.
 
Male
 
workers
 
in
 
recycling
 
recorded
 
the
 
highest
 
response
 
of
 
28%
 
around
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
accidents.
 
 
Among
 
the
 
farmers,
 
91%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents,
 
with
 
52%
 
women
 
farmers
 
recorded
 
experienced
 
threat
 
to
 
safety
 
during
 
work.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
physical

recorded
 
the
 
highest
 
response
 
with
 
47%
 
farmers.
 
Between
 
male
 
and
 
female
 
farmers,
 
43%
 
males’
 
farmers
 
reported
 
carrying
 
heavy
 
loads
 
and
 
26%
 
female
 
farmers
 
reported
 
repetitive
 
hand
 
or
 
arm
 
movements
 
as
 
the
 
most
 
pressing
 
physical
 
demands.
 
 


Workers
 
across
 
the
 
board
 
have
 
varying
 
responses
 
to
 
“not
 
getting
 
enough
 
rest
 
or
 
sleep
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
30
 
days”.
 
While
 
the
 
overall
 
numbers
 
recorded
 
only
 
26%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents
 
agreed
 
to
 
not
 
sleeping
 
or
 
resting
 
enough
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
7
 
days.
 
Among
 
them,
 
.13.5%
 
and
 
6.25%
 
workers
 
did
 
not
 
get
 
enough
 
sleep
 
between
 
3-5
 
days
 
and
 
1-2
 
days
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
1
 
month,
 
respectively . 
 
Workers
 
did
 
acknowledge
 
the
 
need
 
of
 
safety
 
gear
 
in
 
executing
 
their
 
work,
 
but
 
those
 
who
 
use
 
it
 
comprised
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
in
 
the
 
sample.
 
Given
 
the
 
exposure
 
of
 
physically
 
stressful
 
needs
 
of
 
their
 
jobs,
 
across
 
the
 
various
 
categories
 
of
 
workers,
 
81%
 
said
 
that
 
their
 
jobs
 
required
 
them
 
to
 
wear
 
Personal
 
Protective
 
Equipment
 
(PPE)
 
or
 
some
 
safety
 
gear
 
to
 
carry
 
out
 
their
 
duties
 
at
 
work.
 
However ,
 
only
 
46%
 
workers
 
reported
 
having
 
used
 
the
 
safety
 
gear
 
“Always”,
 
7%
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
used
 
it
 
“sometimes”,
 
while
 
10%
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
“never”
 
wear
 
any
 
safety
 
gear.
 
In
 
many
 
cases,
 
it
 
was
 
observed
 
by
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
that
 
the
 
factory
 
infrastructure
 
was
 
designed
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
that
 
it
 
ensured
 
maximum
 
safety
 
for
 
workers
 
like
 
keeping
 
sharp
 
objects
 
like
 
scissors
 
attached
 
to
 
the
 
tables,
 
that
 
workers
 
in
 
their
 
responses
 
got
 
a
 
chance
 
to
 
reflect
 
upon.
 
Another
 
interesting
 
finding
 
around
 
the
 
knowledge
 
of
 
health
 
facilities,
 
in
 
most
 
cases
 
a
 
physical
 
clinic,
 
recorded
 
higher
 
awareness
 
among
 
women
 
workers
 
(39%)
  
as
 
compared
 
to
 
male
 
workers(28%).
 
 
Among
 
garment
 
workers,
 
incidents
 
of
 
loss
 
of
 
sleep
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
7
 
days
 
were
 
reported
 
at
 
40.5%,
 
while
 
that
 
for
 
the
 
recycling
 
group
 
of
 
workers,
 
it
 
was
 
reported
 
at
 
8.7%.
 
13%
 
respondents
 
among
 
the
 
recyclers
 
also
 
reported
 
having
 
lost
 
sleep
 
for
 
3-5
 
days
 
in
 
the
 
past
 
month.
 
 
Only
 
12%
 
agreed
 
having
 
experienced
 
harassment
 
at
 
the
 
workplace,
 
while
 
88%
 
responded
 
no
 
to
 
any
 
such
 
experiences.
 
Out
 
of
 
the
 
12%,
 
6%
 
were
 
men
 
and
 
3%
 
were
 
female
 
workers.
 
Instances
 
of
 
harassment
 
were
 
recorded
 
higher
 
among
 
recyclers
 
(13%)
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
garment
 
workers
 
(9%).
 
 
On
 
an
 
average,
 
workers
 
work
 
for
 
about
 
48
 
hours
 
a
 
week.
 
The
 
work
 
hours
 
are
 
fixed
 
from
 
6-8
 
hours
 
a
 
day
 
with
 
provision
 
for
 
compensation
 
for
 
additional
 
hours.
 
However ,
 
workers
 
do
 
not
 
seem
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
choice
 
when
 
asked
 
to
 
work
 
overtime
 
despite
 
family
 
commitments
 
and
 
physical
 
strain.
 
Worker ’s
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
survey
 
reported
 
that
 
manufacturers
 
do
 
provide
 
some
 
flexibility
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
availing
 
leaves
 
with
 
little
 
or
 
no
 
power
 
to
 
change
 
their
 
starting
 
and
 
ending
 
of
 
their
 
work
 
hours.
 
Key
 
stakeholders
 
during
 
their
 
interaction
 
also
 
highlighted
 
that
 
the
 
short
 
life
 
of
 
manual
 
workers
 
since
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
their
 
work
 
strains
 
the
 
eyes
 
or
 
the
 
back.
 
They
 
emphasized
 
on
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
fair
 
payment
 
to
 
the
 
workers
 
since
 
more
 
of
 
them
 
in
 
the
 
50s
 
tend
 
to
 
move
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
jobs
 
due
 
to
 
inability
 
to
 
do
 
physical
 
work.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Job
 
Satisfaction
 
The
 
workers
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
seemed
 
content
 
with
 
their
 
working
 
conditions
 
and
 
environment.
 
The
 
acknowledgement
 
of
 
health
 
facilities,
 
resting
 
spaces,
 
ESI
 
health
 
insurance,
 
sick
 
leaves
 
etc.
 
accounted
 
for
 
their
 
high
 
satisfaction
 
levels
 
at
 
work.
 
Responses
 
related
 
to
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
were
 
polarizing
 
across
 
the
 
groups
 
of
 
workers.
 
26%
 
workers
 
involved
 
in
 
farming
 
reported
 
“extreme
 
satisfaction”
 
with
 
their
 
work.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
owed
 
to
 
the
 
relatively
 
more
 
entrepreneurial
 
nature
 
of
 
their
 
work,
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
garment
 
workers
 
and
 
recyclers.
 
30%
 
recyclers
 
who
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
“satisfied”
 
and
 
11%
 
who
 
reported
 
“extremely
 
satisfied”
 
seem
 
to
 
have
 
skewed
 
the
 
overall
 
results
 
because
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
comprise
 
of
 
contractually
 
employed
 
waste
 
pickers
 
and
 
collectors
 
who
 
had
 
more
 
say
 
in
 
their
 
jobs
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
other
 
group
 
of
 
workers
 
who
 
were
 
employed
 
under
 
a
 
permanent
 
contract.
 
Though
 
the
 
results
 
for
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
look
 
promising,
 
it
 
could
 
be
 
misleading
 
in
 
multiple
 
ways.
 
While
 
workers
 
do
 
speak
 
about
 
the
 
uncertain
 
job
 
arrangement,
 
poor
 
and
 
irregular
 
wages,
 
their
 
interpretation
 
of
 
job
 
satisfaction
 
appears
 
to
 
be
 
restricted
 
to
 
how
 
good
 
they
 
feel
 
about
 
doing
 
the
 
job
 
and
 
not
 
about
 
the
 
conditions
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
  
Among
 
factory
 
workers,
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
5%
 
workers
 
reported
 
dissatisfaction
 
with
 
the
 
workplace.
 
 
 
Workers
 
asked
 
about
 
whether
 
they
 
felt
 
that
 
their
 
dignity
 
and
 
wellbeing
 
was
 
respected
 
at
 
the
 
workplace,
 
the
 
responses
 
to
 
which
 
were
 
recorded
 
on
 
a
 
scale
 
ranging
 
between
 
“strongly
 
disagree”
 
to
 
“strongly
 
agree.”
  
42%
 
and
 
52%
 
workers
 
responded
 
with
 
“Strongly
 
agree
 
“and”
 
Agree”
 
respectively .
   
The
 
perspective
 
of
 
workers
 
about
 
their
 
workplace
 
maps
 
to
 
their
 
immediate
 
group
 
of
 
reference
 
that
 
they
 
regularly
 
engage
 


with
 
and
 
the
 
relationships
 
and
 
conflict
 
they
 
have
 
with
 
them.
 
While
 
cotton
 
farmers
 
on
 
the
 
whole
 
reported
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
satisfaction
 
with
 
their
 
pace
 
of
 
work,
 
those
 
particularly
 
involved
 
in
 
organic
 
cotton
 
farming
 
raised
 
concerns
 
about
 
the
 
profitability
 
of
 
the
 
same.
 
44%
 
of
 
the
 
male
 
farmers
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
did
 
not
 
find
 
organic
 
cotton
 
profitability
 
because
 
the
 
immediately
 
next
 
value
 
chain
 
player
 
did
 
not
 
recognize
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
organic
 
produce
 
but
 
also
 
compared
 
it
 
with
 
the
 
strength
 
and
 
staple
 
length
 
of
 
the
 
conventional
 
cotton.
 
Women
 
farmers
 
however ,
 
appeared
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
cognizant
 
of
 
the
 
in-kind
 
profitability
 
of
 
organic
 
cotton
 
with
 
32%
 
of
 
them
 
agreeing
 
to
 
the
 
benefits
 
it
 
brings
 
forth.
 
 
 
The
 
study
 
further
 
explored
 
how
 
secure
 
the
 
workers
 
felt
 
under
 
their
 
current
 
jobs.
 
In
 
response
 
to
 
this,
 
76%
 
workers
 
responded
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
highly
 
unlikely
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
lose
 
their
 
jobs
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
months.
 
However ,
 
when
 
probed
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
finding
 
a
 
job
 
like
 
their
 
current
 
role,
 
44%
 
workers
 
said
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
unlikely
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
find
 
a
 
job
 
similar
 
to
 
their
 
current
 
one
 
(15.3%
 
very
 
unlikely ,
 
28.8%
 
unlikely .)
 
These
 
findings
 
could
 
be
 
interpreted
 
in
 
correlation
 
with
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
view
 
of
 
the
 
worker
 
has
 
been
 
restricted
 
to
 
their
 
immediate
 
family
 
and
 
peers
 
at
 
work
 
who
 
in
 
most
 
circumstances
 
would
 
be
 
in
 
similar
 
or
 
worse
 
conditions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opportunities
 
for
 
workers
 
 
 
While
 
workers
 
do
 
get
 
opportunities
 
to
 
grow
 
within
 
their
 
line
 
of
 
work,
 
barriers
 
like
 
education
 
and
 
age
 
deter
 
further
 
promotions,
 
thus
 
saturating
 
their
 
opportunities
 
after
 
a
 
while.
 
Most
 
garment
 
workers
 
join
 
at
 
entry
 
level
 
as
 
a
 
helper
 
or
 
on
 
a
 
contractual
 
basis
 
and
 
have
 
opportunities
 
to
 
move
 
up
 
the
 
ladder
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
experience,
 
skill
 
and
 
competencies
 
(from
 
on-the-job
 
training)
 
to
 
higher
 
levels
 
including
 
supervisory
 
roles.
 
Few
 
responses
 
also
 
reported
 
of
 
taking
 
up
 
roles
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
changing
 
requirements
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
They
 
suggested
 
that
 
workers'
 
roles
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
changed
 
by
 
speaking
 
with
 
their
 
supervisors.
 
Career
 
advancement
 
was
 
largely
 
understood
 
as
 
promotions
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
70%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents
 
reported
 
having
 
received
 
career
 
advancement
 
opportunities
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
promotions.
 
It
 
was
 
found
 
that
 
60%
 
of
 
the
 
respondents
 
received
 
1
 
promotion
 
at
 
their
 
current
 
workplace,
 
while
 
15%
 
received
 
it
 
twice.
 
It
 
was
 
observed
 
that
 
women
 
often
 
tend
 
to
 
do
 
better
 
in
 
moving
 
ahead
 
in
 
their
 
career
 
due
 
to
 
better
 
interpersonal
 
skills,
 
and
 
relationship
 
building
 
with
 
other
 
colleagues.
 
39%
 
of
 
the
 
female
 
respondents
 
and
 
30%
 
of
 
the
 
male
 
respondents
 
reported
 
getting
 
promoted.
 
Those
 
who
 
recorded
 
no
 
promotion
 
belong
 
to
 
the
 
younger
 
age
 
category ,
 
with
 
less
 
than
 
5
 
years
 
of
 
experience
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
 
 
Qualitative
 
interactions
 
also
 
revealed
 
that
 
transition
 
will
 
differently
 
impact
 
different
 
communities.
 
It
 
emerged
 
that
 
while
 
jobs
 
in
 
the
 
energy
 
sector
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
as
 
highly
 
impacted
 
since
 
it
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
more
 
conscious
 
choices
 
related
 
to
 
cleaner
 
and
 
more
 
efficient
 
energies.
 
Stakeholders
 
currently
 
working
 
on
 
waste
 
management
 
and
 
recycling
 
also
 
emphasized
 
that
 

while
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
jobs
 
for
 
workers
 
in
 
this
 
sector
 
may
 
not
 
change
 
as
 
much,
 
the
 
nature
 
and
 
working
 
conditions
 
will
 
only
 
improve
 
for
 
the
 
better .
 
Recyclers
 
further
 
highlighted
 
how
 
the
 
jobs
 
for
 
low
 
skilled
 
women
 
workers
 
will
 
only
 
increase
 
soon
 
for
 
segregation
 
and
 
sorting
 
roles,
 
since
 
employers
 
find
 
women
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
skillful
 
in
 
these
 
manual
 
roles
 
as
 
compared
 
to
 
male
 
workers.
 
(This
 
insight
 
aligns
 
itself
 
with
 
the
 
economic
 
model
 
developed
 
by
 
the
 
university
 
of
 
Lincoln.
 
In

The
 
perception
 
of
 
different
 
workers
 
including
 
recyclers,
 
permanent
 
operators
 
and
 
contractual
 
operators
 
was
 
also
 
studied.
 
About
 
60%
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
across
 
categories
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
job
 
provided
 
them
 
with
 
opportunity
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
grow .
 
About
 
70%
 
of
 
the

reported
 
that
 
they
 
believe
 
that
 
the
 
men
 
and
 
women
 
have
 
similar
 
opportunities
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
 
 
Most
 
informal
 
workers

home-based
 
workers
 
are
 
subcontracted
 
by
 
manufacturers
 
and
 
paid
 
by
 
the
 
piece
 
rate
 
system.
 
The
 
home-based
 
workers
 
comprise
 
5
 
millions
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
workforces

in
 
the

are
 
often
 
left
 
behind
 
with
 
no

security
 
and
 
social
 
protection
 
coverage
 
neither
 
from
 
the
 
employer
 
because
 
of
 
subcontracting
 
provisions,
 
nor
 
from
 
community

Anohita

shared
 
how
 
collectivization
 
into

exposes
 
these
 
workers
 
to
 
like-minded

like

,
 
in
 
order
 
to

She
 
also
 
shared
 
how
 
the
 
ETI’s
 
time
 
and
 
motion
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
2
quote
 
the
 
rates
 
to
 
exporters,
 
thereby
 
preventing
 
any
 
stress
 
or
 
exploitation.
  
 
 
It
 
further
 
emerged
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
that
 
the
 
demand
 
for
 
artisanal
 
workers
 
using
 
hand
 
work
 
and
 
natural
 
fiber
 
requires
 
high
 
maintenance,
 
thus
 
making
 
it
 
expensive.
 
This
 
has
 
been
 
the
 
reason
 
for
 
the
 
small
 
and
 
niche
 
market
 
base
 
for
 
artisanal
 
products.
 
It
 
is
 
to
 
curb
 
this
 
challenge
 
of
 
limited
 
outreach
 
that
 
Sharma
 
suggests
 
shifting
 
the
 
focus
 
from
 
luxury
 
products
 
to
 
skilling
 
workers
 
for
 
more
 
utility
 
products
 
that
 
can
 
provide
 
them
 
with
 
enough
 
and
 
regular

The
 
world’s
 
most
 
vulnerable
 
garment
 
workers
 
aren’t
 
in
 
factories
 
–
 
and
 
global
 
brands
 
need
 
to
 
step
 
up
 
to
 
protect

The
 
recycling
 
supply
 
chain
 
in
 
India
 
is
 
fragmented
 
and
 
relies
 
heavily
 
on
 
informal
 
waste
 
pickers,
 
collectors,
 
and
 
segregators.
 
The
 
giant
 
recycling
 
units
 
are
 
mostly
 
family
 
run
 
businesses
 
that
 
have
 
been
 
operational
 
over
 
years.
  
The
 
core
 
workers
 
within
 
the
 
recycling
 
units
 
are
 
women
 
involved
 
in
 
sorting
 
and
 
segregating
 
waste,
 
while
 
those
 
involved
 
in
 
actual
 
waste
 
processing
 
are
 
more
 
skilled
 
workers
 
with
 
technical
 
expertise.
 
The
 
categorization
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
strata
 
is
 
stringent
 
with
 
little
 
or
 
no
 
scope
 
for
 
those
 
in
 
the
 
lower
 
ranks
 
to
 
learn
 
and
 
climb
 
up
 
the
 
ladder .
 
The
 
study
 
also
 
revealed
 
that
 
even
 
these
 
workers
 
employed
 
within
 
the
 
recycler
 
units
 
work
 
on
 
contractual
 
agreements,
 
thus
 
making
 
them
 
more
 
vulnerable
 
and
 
susceptible
 
to
 
crisis
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
any
 
shock
 
or
 
disaster .
 
 
Traditional
 
garment
 
workers
 
employed
 
in
 
the
 
factory
 
units
 
are
 
far
 
more
 
secure
 
and
 
are
 
more
 
exposed
 
to
 
potential
 
opportunities
 
for
 
growth.
  
They
 
have
 
basic
 
social
 
protection
 
coverage
 
and
 
stable
 
salaries
 
every
 
month.
 
Their
 
perception
 
of
 
growth
 
is,
 
however ,
 
constrained
 
to
 
their
 
line
 
of
 
command.
 
Factory
 
workers,
 
both
 
in
 
traditional
 
garment
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
recycling
 
do
 
not
 
see
 
alternative
 
opportunities
 
outside
 
of
 
their
 
sector ,
 
since
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
take
 
up
 
this
 
work
 
by
 
virtue
 
of
 
belonging
 
to
 
communities
 
or
 
families
 
wherein
 
older
 
generations
 
have
 
built
 
a
 
rapport
 
with
 
the
 
employer
 
and
 
feel
 
obliged
 
to
 
work
 
under
 
them
 
for
 
generations.
 
 
 
Skilled
 
workers
 
will
 
be
 
relatively
 
well
 
placed
 
with
 
opportunities
 
and
 
better
 
access
 
to
 
pathways
 
to
 
transition,
 
it
 
is
 
felt
 
that
 
semi-skilled
 
and
 
unskilled
 
workers
 
in
 
the
 
manufacturing
 
sector
 
are
 
likely
 
to
 
lose
 
due
 
to
 
lack
 
of
 
awareness
 
about
 
reskilling
 
or
 
the
 
opportunities
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
undertake
 
these
 
training.
 
Informal
 
workers
 
in
 
the
 
recycling
 
space
 
and
 
waste
 
pickers
 
are
 
unprotected
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
left
 
behind
 
if
 
not
 
for
 
reskilling
 
and
 
training
 
opportunities.
 
 
The
 
demand
 
for
 
organic
 
cotton
 
quality
 
looks
 
upbeat
 
in
 
the
 
medium
 
to
 
long
 
term
 
despite
 
requirements
 
of
 
virgin
 
materials
 
likely
 
to
 
reduce
 
multifold.
 
However ,
 
the
 
quality
 
standards
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
be
 
high
 
and
 
the
 
fragmented
 
nature
 
of
 
agriculture,
 
lack
 
of
 
awareness
 
and
 
training
 
amongst
 
small
 
farmers
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
barrier
 
to
 
tap
 
the
 
demand
 
potential.
 
 
Worker
 
surveys
 
suggest
 
that
 
while
 
technology
 
is
 
introduced
 
in
 
their
 
place
 
of
 
work,
 
they
 
are
 
not
 
exposed,
 
reskilled,
 
or
 
re-trained
 
around
 
it
 
and
 
a
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
technical
 
experts
 
get
 
to
 
use
 
and
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
new
 
machines.
  
In
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
future
 
of
 
work
 
and
 
reskilling,
 
worker
 
surveys
 
suggested
 
that
 
most
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
not
 
exposed
 
to
 
the
 
opportunities
 
available
 
or
 
even
 
envisage
 
any
 
major
 
changes
 
around
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
their
 
work.
 
 
 
Mainstreaming
 
indigenous
 
artisans
 
through
 
training
 
and
 
capacity
 
strengthening
 
is
 
the
 
need
 
of
 
the
 
hour.
 
People
 
involved
 
in
 
hand
 
embroidery
 
and
 
stitching
 
will
 
have
 
increased
 
skills
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
absorbed
 
better
 
in
 
the
 
circular
 
business
 
models.
  
 

 
Worker
 
voices
 
and
 
representation
 
 
Workers
 
across
 
the
 
board
 
were
 
asked
 
questions
 
about
 
their
 
representation,
 
association
 
and
 
participation
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
This
 
section
 
aimed
 
at
 
exploring
 
the
 
hypothesis
 
that
 
workers
 
in
 
India
 
are
 
poorly
 
represented
 
with
 
little
 
or
 
no
 
power
 
to
 
unionize
 
and
 
leverage
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
collective
 
bargaining.
 
 
 
Workers
 
were
 
asked
 
whether
 
they
 
know
 
of
 
any
 
union
 
in
 
their
 
factory ,
 
or
 
region
 
to
 
which
 
46%
 
responded
 
positively .
 
The
 
others
 
did
 
not
 
know
 
of
 
any
 
labor
 
union
 
around
 
them.
 
When
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
membership
 
in
 
unions,
 
workers
 
working
 
at
 
the
 
designation
 
of
 
operator
 
appeared
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
most
 
exposure
 
and
 
chance
 
of
 
unionization.
 
Workers
 
lower
 
in
 
the
 
strata
 
reported
 
both
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
ignorance
 
and
 
lack
 
of
 
association
 
opportunities.
 
 
Findings
 
in
 
this
 
section
 
also
 
differed
 
by
 
the
 
gender
 
of
 
workers.
 
Overall,
 
female
 
workers
 
seemed
 
to
 
have
 
shared
 
better
 
relationships
 
with
 
their
 
peers
 
and
 
supervisors.
 
 
When
 
asked
 
whether
 
workers
 
shared
 
work
 
related
 
problems
 
with
 
their
 
supervisors,
 
only
 
66%
 
workers
 
said
 
“yes”.
 
Out
 
of
 
the
 
66%,
 
42%
 
were
 
women.
 
This
 
was
 
followed
 
up
 
by
 
questions
 
related
 
to
 
their
 
perception
 
about
 
inclusive
 
decision
 
making
 
and
 
goal
 
setting.
 
the
 
statement
 
“I
 
am
 
consulted
 
before
 
my
 
targets
 
are
 
set”
 
was
 
put
 
to
 
the
 
respondents.
 
10%
 
of
 
female
 
workers
 
“strongly
 
agreed”,
 
followed
 
by
 
40%
 
of
 
them
 
“agreeing”.
 
The
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
either
 
recorded
 
a
 
“neutral”
 
response
 
(3%)
 
or
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
“do
 
not
 
set
 
targets”
 
(6%).
 
The
 
results
 
for
 
this
 
could
 
also
 
be
 
attributed
 
to
 
the
 
bias
 
they
 
have
 
with
 
higher
 
sense
 
of
 
belongingness
 
and
 
indebtedness
 
to
 
their
 
employers.
 
 
 
Workers
 
in
 
the
 
recycling
 
segment
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
those
 
holding
 
higher
 
designations
 
in
 
the
 
factory
 
units
 
reported
 
positive
 
responses
 
when
 
asked
 
about
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
influence
 
decisions
 
that
 
are
 
important
 
for
 
their
 
work.
 
However ,
 
there
 
was
 
higher
 
dissatisfaction
 
reported
 
in
 
the
 
way
 
their
 
opinions
 
are
 
considered.
 
Workers
 
have
 
always
 
had
 
the
 
fear
 
of
 
bearing
 
the
 
brunt
 
for
 
speaking
 
out
 
by
 
losing
 
their
 
jobs
 
or
 
wages.
 
Weak
 
and
 
deterring
 
policies
 
around
 
unionization
 
has
 
further
 
aggravated
 
the
 
situation
 
for
 
workers.
 
 


 
Workers
 
involved
 
in
 
organic
 
cotton
 
farming
 
highlighted
 
how
 
collectivization
 
enabled
 
them
 
to
 
take
 
up
 
organic
 
farming
 
not
 
only
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
knowledge
 
and
 
awareness
 
but
 
also
 
the
 
techniques
 
and
 
input
 
support
 
that
 
individuals
 
would
 
have
 
found
 
more
 
challenging
 
to
 
access.
 
On
 
being
 
asked
 
about
 
the
 
conflict
 
resolution
 
mechanism
 
at
 
work,
 
farmers
 
reported
 
various
 
informal
 
channels
 
like
 
reaching
 
out
 
to
 
the
 
village
 
head
 
(20%),
 
informal
 
negotiation
 
(20%),
 
elderly
 
members
 
in
 
the
 
family
 
and
 
community
 
(16%),
 
direct
 
employer
 
on
 
the
 
field
 
(4%)
 
and
 
police
 
(4%).
 
Considering
 
that
 
large
 
scale
 
transition
 
to
 
circular
 
models
 
will
 
reduce
 
production
 
of
 
conventional
 
cotton
 
and
 
increase
 
organic
 
cotton
 
production
 
formal
 
grievance
 
redressal
 
mechanisms
 
and
 
formation
 
of
 
farmer
 
producer
 
companies
 
for
 
collective
 
bargaining
 
power
 
to
 
ensure
 
just
 
transition.
 
 
 
Interactions
 
with
 
members
 
form
 
the
 
labor
 
unions
 
also
 
highlighted
 
how
 
the
 
post
 
pandemic
 
times
 
hold
 
a
 
bigger
 
challenge
 
for
 
factory
 
workers
 
because
 
of
 
rising
 
cases
 
of
 
harassment
 
and
 
human
 
rights
 
exploitation.
  
It
 
was
 
mentioned
 
that
 
limited
 
workforce,
 
and
 
increased
 
demands
 
from
 
the
 
brands
 
and
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
manufacturers
 
to
 
meet
 
their
 
targets
 
has
 
left
 
workers
 
more
 
exploited
 
than
 
ever.
 
President
 
of
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
worker
 
unions
 
highlighted
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
intervention
 
by
 
worker
 
unions
 
along
 
with
 
other
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
safeguard
 
the
 
rights
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
vulnerable
 
workers
 
including
 
women
 
and
 
the
 
aged.
 
She
 
further
 
highlighted
 
how
 
workers
 
themselves
 
do
 
not
 
want
 
to
 
associate
 
themselves
 
with
 
the
 
unions
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
constrained
 
perception
 
about
 
their
 
protest
 
and
 
fear
 
of
 
losing
 
jobs
 
if
 
they
 
stand
 
by
 
the
 
union.
 
Other
 
international
 
labor
 
rights
 
organizations
 
further
 
emphasized
 
on
 
the
 
need
 
to
 
build
 
trust
 
among
 
workers
 
and
 
with
 
their
 
management.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Alternative
 
Job
 
Opportunities
 
 
In
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
large-scale
 
transition
 
from
 
traditional
 
garment
 
manufacturing
 
to
 
more
 
circular
 
models,
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
this
 
section
 
was
 
to
 
understand
 
areas
 
that
 
workers
 
currently
 
see
 
as
 
alternative
 
opportunities,
 
both
 
within
 
the
 
apparel
 
industry
 
and
 
outside.
 
It
 
emerged
 
from
 
the
 
study
 
that
 
workers
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
any
 
perception
 
about
 
any
 
alternative
 
job
 
they
 
could
 
be
 
doing.
 
77%
 
workers
 
from
 
the
 
surveys
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
never
 
considered
 
working
 
outside
 
of
 
their
 
present
 
roles
 
and
 
sector .
 
Workers
 
further
 
explained
 
that
 
they
 
get
 
involved
 
in
 
different
 
roles
 
within
 
the
 
sector
 
by
 
virtue
 
of
 
their
 
birth
 
in
 
particular
 
families
 
or
 
communities.
 
They
 
end
 
up
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
sector
 
because
 
this
 
has
 
been
 
carrying
 
on
 
for
 
generations.
 
Aspiration
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
also
 
emerged
 
to
 
be
 
quite
 
low
 
among
 
workers
 
across
 
the
 
board.
  
In
 
ten
 
years'
 
time
 
78%
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
see
 
themselves
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
position
 
as
 
today .
 
 
Those
 
who
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
advancement
 
can
 
only
 
think
 
of
 
their
 
immediate
 
line
 
supervisors’.
   
 
On
 
further
 
probing
 
and
 
listing
 
potential
 
opportunities,
 
a
 
significant
 
number
 
of
 
workers
 
were
 
interested
 
in
 
starting
 
their
 
own
 
businesses.
 
Majority
 
of
 
women
 
workers
 
were
 
also
 
interested
 
in
 
entrepreneurship
 
opportunities.
 
The
 
major
 
reason
 
holding
 
the
 
workers
 
back
 
was
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
financial
 
capital
 
and
 
business
 
skills.
  
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
transition
 
in
 
the
 
sector ,
 
traditional
 
garment
 
workers
 
do
 
not
 
foresee
 
any
 
loss
 
of
 
jobs
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
six
 
months.
 
This
 
is
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
views
 
of
 
stakeholders
 
who
 
mentioned
 
that
 
mainstreaming
 
circular
 
models
 
would
 
be
 
difficult
 
unless
 
large-scale
 
demand
 
is
 
reached.
  
Nohar
 
from
 
Kiabza
 
and
 
Kischo
 
highlighted
 
how
 
the
 
fashion
 
system
 
has
 
failed
 
to
 
capture
 
the
 
affordability
 
angle
 
in
 
sustainable
 
clothing.
 
For
 
consumers,
 
a
 
more
 
expensive
 
garment,
 
which
 
is
 

of
 
a
 
lesser
 
quality
 
than
 
virgin
 
product
 
is
 
something
 
that
 
is
 
still
 
confusing.
 
Unless
 
markets
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
tap
 
into
 
consumer
 
behavior ,
 
consciousness
 
towards
 
sustainable
 
clothing
 
along
 
with
 
affordability ,
 
reaching
 
economies
 
of
 
scale
 
would
 
be
 
challenging
 
even
 
beyond
 
the
 
next
 
decade.
 
 
 
Trainings
 
regarding
 
health
 
and
 
safety
 
of
 
workers
 
were
 
organized
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
Apart
 
from
 
this,
 
the
 
trainings
 
also
 
included
 
topics
 
like
 
rights,
 
anti-discrimination
 
at
 
workplace
 
and
 
soft
 
skills.
 
 
It
 
was
 
clearly
 
found
 
that
 
the
 
women
 
workers
 
were
 
more
 
receptive
 
towards
 
capacity
 
building
 
and
 
training.
 
65%
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
reported
 
that
 
they
 
believe
 
that
 
training
 
would
 
help
 
them
 
secure
 
better
 
job
 
opportunities.
 
34%
 
of
 
the
 
women
 
reported
 
that
 
their
 
duties
 
corresponded
 
with
 
their
 
skill.
 
This
 
figure
 
was
 
only
 
7%
 
among
 
the
 
male
 
respondents.
  
Women
 
workers
 
feel
 
more
 
positive
 
and
 
aspirational
 
about
 
their
 
work
 
in
 
the
 
sector .
 
Out
 
of
 
41%
 
workers
 
who
 
said
 
that
 
their
 
skills
 
correspond
 
with
 
their
 
duties,
 
34%
 
were
 
women.
 
Need
 
for
 
further
 
training
 
also
 
emerged
 
with
 
32%
 
workers
 
pointing
 
towards
 
the
 
same.
 
21%
 
of
 
the
 
female
 
respondents
 
expressed
 
that
 
they
 
need
 
further
 
training
 
to
 
deliver
 
on
 
their
 
duties.
 
11%
 
of
 
the
 
male
 
respondents
 
reported
 
requiring
 
any
 
further
 
training.
 
 
Despite
 
their
 
willingness
 
to
 
upgrade
 
themselves
 
on
 
various
 
skills,
 
77%
 
workers
 
said
 
that
 
they
 
have
 
not
 
considered
 
working
 
outside
 
of
 
their
 
present
 
roles/sector .
 
78%
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
see
 
themselves
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
position
 
as
 
today .
 
This
 
is
 
largely
 
due
 
to
 
uncertainty
 
and
 
lack
 
of
 
capital
 
to
 
undertake
 
any
 
self-employment
 
ventures.
  
66%
 
respondents
 
said
 
they
 
wanted
 
to
 
'start
 
their
 
own
 
business'
 
but
 
were
 
held
 
back
 
by
 
the
 
lack
 
of
 
investment
 
and
 
business
 
skills.
 
 
 
Fashion
 
experts
 
and
 
stakeholders
 
currently
 
working
 
in
 
circular
 
models
 
do
 
not
 
anticipate
 
a
 
major
 
shift
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
decade.
 
Initiatives
 
within
 
the
 
sector
 
will
 
take
 
place
 
in
 
small
 
pockets
 
if
 
the
 
transition
 
happens
 
at
 
the
 
current
 
pace,
 
with
 
no
 
major
 
impact
 
on
 
jobs
 
and
 
earnings.
 
Representative
 
of
 
a
 
major
 
rental
 
platform
 
expressed
 
that
 
if
 
circular
 
models
 
get
 
adopted
 
at
 
large
 
scale,
 
“It
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
somewhat
 
similar
 
impact
 
as
 
ride
 
hailing
 
services
 
had
 
on
 
mobility .
 
They
 
increased
 
mobility
 
and
 
new
 
opportunities.
 
Similarly
 
circular
 
fashion
 
will
 
create
 
more
 
opportunities
 
for
 
the
 
skilled
 
workers
 
and
 
business
 
environment.”
 
He
 
further
 
spoke
 
of
 
the
 
change
 
in
 
supply
 
chains
 
and
 
interaction
 
between
 
the
 
consumption
 
and
 
production
 
countries”
 
but
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
new
 
and
 
more
 
opportunities
 
rather
 
than
 
shrinking
 
of
 
opportunities.”
 
 
Stakeholders'
 
interactions
 
with
 
those
 
already
 
working
 
on
 
various
 
circular
 
models
 
like
 
recycling
 
are
 
opposed
 
to
 
the
 
hypothesis
 
that
 
automation
 
will
 
act
 
as
 
a
 
disruptor
 
and
 
impact
 
livelihoods
 
of
 
traditional
 
workers.
 
They
 
believe
 
that
 
while
 
automation
 
may
 
make
 
work
 
more
 
efficient,
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
stitching
 
work
 
will
 
still
 
require
 
human
 
resources.
 
They
 
do
 
not
 
feel
 
that
 
automation
 
will
 
be
 
so
 
sophisticated
 
that
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
transform
 
the
 
entire
 
chain
 
of
 
production.
 
 

Recommendations
 
While
 
the
 
low
 
cost
 
of
 
labor
 
is
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
India
 
to
 
capitalise
 
for
 
fast
 
tracking
 
circular
 
initiatives
 
within
 
the
 
apparel
 
sector ,
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
important
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
jobs
 
improve,
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
labor
 
rights
 
and
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
overall
 
social
 
protection
 
coverage.
 
With
 
respect
 
to
 
the
 
formal
 
sector ,
 
the
 
factory
 
management
 
needs
 
to
 
build
 
more
 
trust
 
with
 
their
 
workers.
 
Improving
 
grievance
 
redressal
 
mechanism
 
for
 
workers
 
in
 
the
 
workplace.
 
While
 
workers
 
have
 
knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
committees
 
in
 
place,
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
approaching
 
the
 
committee
 
is
 
not
 
clear
 
to
 
the
 
workers.
 
It
 
emerged
 
that
 
workers
 
were
 
hesitant
 
of
 
being
 
recognized
 
and
 
using
 
the
 
secret
 
ballots
 
in
 
the
 
few
 
factories
 
that
 
had
 
these
 
mechanisms.
 
Workers
 
are
 
extremely
 
dependent
 
on
 
their
 
line
 
supervisors.
 
While
 
this
 
seems
 
to
 
have
 
worked
 
in
 
most
 
cases,
 
creating
 
more
 
open
 
forums
 
to
 
voice
 
their
 
concerns
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
help
 
reduce
 
the
 
pressure
 
from
 
the
 
supervisor
 
but
 
also
 
prevent
 
chances
 
of
 
exploitation
 
of
 
workers
 
in
 
the
 
hands
 
of
 
the
 
supervisors
 
themselves.
 
 
 
While
 
the
 
formal
 
sector
 
still
 
has
 
some
 
mechanisms
 
for
 
worker
 
wellbeing
 
and
 
social
 
protection,
 
the
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
working
 
in
 
the
 
informal
 
sector
 
is
 
unavailable
 
or
 
very
 
scanty
 
in
 
the
 
secondary
 
literature.
 
Our
 
experience
 
in
 
some
 
interactions
 
with
 
labor
 
rights
 
organizations
 
and
 
worker
 
associations
 
tells
 
us
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
highly
 
vulnerable
 
to
 
livelihood
 
and
 
income
 
shocks
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
precarious
 
nature
 
of
 
demand
 
from
 
the
 
manufacturers
 
and
 
absence
 
of
 
transparency
 
in
 
the
 
value
 
chain.
 
There
 
is
 
uncertainty
 
on
 
the
 
availability
 
of
 
work,
 
no
 
minimum
 
wages
 
standards,
 
social
 
protection
 
benefits
 
etc.
 
for
 
these
 
workers.
 
The
 
absence
 
of
 
data
 
on
 
the
 
informal
 
sector
 
workers
 
is
 
perhaps
 
the
 
biggest
 
gap,
 
leading
 
to
 
lack
 
of
 
information
 
in
 
identifying
 
their
 
status
 
and
 
how
 
the
 
situation
 
can
 
be
 
improved
 
for
 
them.
 
 
At
 
the
 
ecosystem
 
level,
 
an
 
integrated
 
approach
 
towards
 
improving
 
working
 
conditions
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
adopted
 
that
 
involves
 
interventions
 
at
 
the
 
policy ,
 
system
 
and
 
behavioural
 
level.
 
Strengthening
 
social
 
protection
 
systems
 
particularly
 
for
 
the
  
informal
 
and
 
contractual
 
workers
 
to
 
enable
 
them
 
and
 
build
 
their
 
resilience
 
for
 
surviving
  
demand
 
shocks
 
and
 
other
 
disruption
 
of
 
the
 
gig
 
economy .
 
There
 
would
 
also
 
be
 
more
 
opportunities
 
emerging
 
for
 
artisanal
 
handicrafts
 
that
 
would
 
require
 
reskilling
 
of
 
the
 
workers
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
designing
 
requirements
 
and
 
trends
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
Skilling
 
and
 
capacity
 
building
 
would
 
also
 
include
 
training
 
on
 
soft
 
skills
 
thereby
 
empowering
 
them
 
for
 
change
 
readiness.
 
 
 
Allowing
 
and
 
enabling
 
workers
 
and
 
farmers
 
the
 
freedom
 
to
 
associate
 
and
 
make
 
room
 
for
 
collective
 
bargaining.
 
This
 
would
 
ensure
 
improved
 
participation
 
of
 
workers
 
at
 
the
 
workplace.
 
Small
 
and
 
marginal
 
farmers
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
skilled
 
on
 
organic
 
farming
 
and
 
climate
 
smart
 
agriculture
 
practices
 
including
 
support
 
on
 
certifications,
 
value
 
chain
 
and
 
market
 
linkages.
 
An
 
industry
 
road
 
map
 
for
 
skilling
 
also
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
developed
 
for
 
the
 
farmers
 
in
 
production
 
of
 
organic
 
cotton
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
fragmented
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
agriculture
 
sector
 
and
 
lack
 
of
 
awareness
 
amongst
 
the
 
small
 

and
 
marginal
 
farmers.
 
Further ,
 
smooth
 
transition
 
would
 
also
 
require
 
the
 
support
 
of
 
labor
 
organizations
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
the
 
workers
 
would
 
be
 
crucial
 
in
 
identifying
 
training
 
and
 
reskilling
 
opportunities.
 
The
 
innovations
 
in
 
recycling,
 
repair
 
and
 
rental
 
models
 
are
 
driven
 
in
 
isolation
 
and
 
the
 
integration
 
of
 
circular
 
models
 
is
 
at
 
a
 
very
 
nascent
 
stage.
 
Support
 
from
 
policy
 
makers,
 
ecosystem
 
players
 
will
 
be
 
very
 
crucial
 
in
 
incentivizing
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
transition
 
sooner
 
and
 
better
 
for
  
advancing
 
these
 
industries.
 
 
 
The
 
country
 
requires
 
a
 
strategic
 
approach
 
to
 
understand
 
and
 
adopt
 
circular
 
models
 
of
 
garment
 
production
 
at
 
scale.
 
Lack
 
of
 
evidence
 
and
 
data
 
around
 
workers
 
got
 
highlighted
 
in
 
recent
 
times
 
during
 
the
 
pandemic.
 
Smooth
 
and
 
inclusive
 
transition
 
will
 
require
 
further
 
research
 
and
 
pilot
 
of
 
models
 
to
 
accurately
 
estimate
 
the
 
impact
 
and
 
its
 
nature
 
on
 
livelihoods.</content>
