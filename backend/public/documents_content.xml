Context India accounts for nearly 25% of the world’s cotton production. Cotton is indeed one of the most important commercial crops cultivated in India. It plays a major role in sustaining the livelihoods of an estimated 6 million cotton farmers and 40-50 million people engaged in allied activities such as cotton processing and trade 1 . Apart from being the key commodity in fulﬁlling the clothing requirements of the Indian populace, cotton is also one of the largest contributors to the country’s net foreign exchange. For this very reason, it is rightly termed as the ‘White Gold’ of the country. Better Cotton spearheads the world’s sustainability initiatives for cotton. Their mission is to ‘help cotton communities survive and thrive, while protecting and restoring the environment’. With 13 implementation partners on ground, India was one of the ﬁrst countries to have actively supported and implemented the ‘Better Cotton’ initiatives with its farmers. At present, the program is operational in about 6 states of India namely - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and Karnataka. By way of establishing learning groups and producer units, Better Cotton aims to capacitate the farmers to adopt sustainable cotton farming practices leading to reduced pesticide usage, optimal fertiliser usage, reduced cultivation costs, improved ﬁbre quality, improved working conditions which is ultimately aimed at bringing about increased volumes of cotton being licensed and sold as ‘better’ cotton in the global markets . The signiﬁcance of &amp;#x27;better cotton&amp;#x27; programs in India becomes imperative in light of the country’s formidable challenges with issues such as climate change, water scarcity, and deteriorating soil health, all of which exacerbate the already daunting issues faced by the country&amp;#x27;s smallholder cotton farmers. The cultivation of cotton in India is further complicated by persistent pest pressures. Therefore, prioritising and implementing &amp;#x27;better cotton&amp;#x27; programs is crucial to address and mitigate the adverse effects of these challenges on India&amp;#x27;s cotton industry and the livelihoods of its farmers. CMS’ longstanding involvement in the development sector has granted it a profound understanding of the vital connection between cotton cultivation and the livelihoods it sustains. Additionally, the organisation is devoted to partnering with cotton cultivators, picking on the signiﬁcance of cotton as a symbol of sustainability and its role in environmental restoration. Recognizing the intricacies of this agricultural practice, the ﬁrm also aspires to deepen its engagement and contribute meaningfully to the betterment of cultivators&amp;#x27; lives. As active proponents of the Sustainable Development Goals, we are steadfast in our commitment to advancing these global objectives. Cotton cultivation, in particular, plays a pivotal role in supporting biodiversity and preserving soil fertility, crucial components for sustainable cultivation. Through our initiatives and partnerships, CMS aims to not only promote sustainable practices but also foster a resilient and thriving ecosystem that beneﬁts both the environment and the communities dependent on cotton cultivation. 1 Cotton Sector - Ministry of Textiles Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

Our Understanding of ToR 2.1. About the program Better Cotton stands as the globe&amp;#x27;s foremost cotton sustainability initiative. Its mission is dedicated to fostering the survival and prosperity of cotton communities while safeguarding and rejuvenating the health of the community and environment. Through a widespread network of on-the-ground collaborators, Better Cotton has delivered training on sustainable farming practices to over 2.9 million cotton farmers across 26 nations. The innovative pilot project called - the &amp;#x27;Producer Unit Rescoping&amp;#x27; (PURE) pilot aims to try out a new, landscape-based approach to implementing the Better Cotton system at the farm level to improve efﬁciency and effectiveness of the program. Instead of the prevailing method that centres solely on speciﬁed (typically male) farmers on a designated list, PURE broadens its scope to encompass all farming households within a deﬁned geographic unit in the Better Cotton programs. 2.1.1 Objectives of the Program The rescoping approach primarily has the following objectives - ● Enhance capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labour practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. ● Improve efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. ● Support Better Cotton&amp;#x27;s traceability goal by strengthening farm-to-gin traceability and eliminating individual farm segregation. 2.1.2. Objectives of the Evaluation Given the context of the program, the overall objective of the project MEL is to: ● Evaluate the feasibility and viability of replicating or scaling up the pilot. ● Evaluate the project against its pre-deﬁned objectives* as given below: ○ 15% reduction in data collection and administration effort for ﬁeld staff; enabling this time and effort to be spent on other activities more closely tied to impact. ○ 15% increase in participation of Better Cotton activities amongst women members of farming households in the project area, compared to the traditional farmer list approach. ○ Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing in the same project area, without increase in project cost. (*The scope of this proposal is limited to monitoring the values of the indicators for the above objectives at the baseline only.) ● Verify key project assumptions in the ToC and implement MEL.

Scope of the Evaluation The scope of the evaluation covers a baseline study (for answering the key evaluation questions) for the 2 farmer producer units that will be conducted in collaboration with the Better Cotton team and the Programme Partner WWF Telangana. The 2 PUs together cover an area of approximately 5,000 hectares catering to about 10,000 farmers. Data for the evaluation would be collected from a predetermined sample for the given population.

Technical Approach 3.1 Monitoring and Evaluation Approach The proposed approach to conduct the MEL exercise necessitates creation of a logical ﬂow to develop a research methodology given the base problem statement and project objectives, building a knowledge consistency on ToC and expected beneﬁts across stakeholders, conﬁdence and clarity through participatory tool development process and delivering a robust analytical framework. Figure: Flow of Research Methodology ● Review of the Theory of Change and other program documents - The implementation assumptions as per the project vision, rescoping of PU and TOC - expected beneﬁts for farmers, community and environment will be reviewed through the lens of systems thinking against the roles and inﬂuence of market-prices and players / supply versus demand, farmer group dynamics, agro-climatic externalities and the farm to fork supply chain. ○ The causal assumptions and processes as per the innovation model-rescoping of PU for BCI farmers, enabling conditions and beneﬁts for farmers, community and environment will be reviewed through the lens of design thinking. How appropriately the processes are designed in consideration of the farmers or women farmers’ day to day challenges is crucial to identify the critical barriers and key success factors. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The quantitative survey would be digitised on the SurveyCTO platform in English and in Telugu. Qualiﬁed enumerators would be hired to administer the CAPI tool. ● Field assessment - Having extensively conducted ﬁeld assignments in southern India (and especially in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), the data collection team at CMS (community engagement lead, supervisors and enumerators) are well-versed with the regional milieu and possess excellent written and verbal communication skills in Telugu besides English. Quantitative surveys would be conducted with the sampled PU farmers as per the sampling strategy described below. Information would be captured qualitatively using Focus Group Discussions with the farmers and conducting key informant interviews with staff from the program team, representatives from the community and if possible the ginner. ○ Sampling Strategy - Given that the Producer Unit rescoping pilot is going to be conducted with a population of about 10,000 farmers, the sample size calculated is as follows. This sample size is chosen such that it is sufﬁcient to draw inferences for the population while also adhering to the prescribed budgetary constraints. Sample Size proposed - 120 for the farmer quantitative survey. Parameters include – ● Conﬁdence Level - 90% ● Margin of Error - 7.5% ● Population Proportion - 50% ● Population size - 10,116 Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Further, to account for effective representation of respondents at each stage, proportional quota sampling technique would be used. Based on the program literature reviewed, the heterogeneity factors that would be considered for sampling at each stage and the associated number of respondents is shown below - ● Year of inception of the original PU ● Region (block, villages and learning groups) ● Gender ● Farmer land size ● Irrigation pattern ● Farmers growing and not growing cotton ● Old and new farmers. This multi-stage sampling approach (with numbers wherever possible) is shown in the table below - (The heterogeneity factors and sampling numbers considered are tentative and would only be ﬁnalised with agreement from the program team.)

Apart from triangulation of information obtained from the surveys, the qualitative data is intended to understand the thoughts, insights, beliefs and drivers of motivation of participating farmers and the program staff in the rescoped producer unit. The sampling for the qualitative data collection is as follows - Qualitative interviews Sample Focus group discussion (men) 4 Focus group discussion (women) 4 Key Informant Interviews (project partner staff) - (Quant and Qual) 6 Key Informant Interviews (program team) 3 Key Informant Interviews (community leaders) 3 Total 20 Table: Sampling for qualitative data collection Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

Besides them, a detailed evaluation framework-(RCEEIS, Cost-Effectiveness evaluation and Gender Analysis framework) will play a crucial role to consolidate the ﬁndings and present them in a meaningful fashion. ○ Quantitative analysis - The quantitative data collected at the farmer level will be analysed using advanced statistical tools such as STATA. All analysis will be carried out in stages. At ﬁrst, descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, quartile or decile distribution will be done along with frequency tables to measure KPIs. Then as a second step, causality would be established using evaluation methods as relevant to the methodology adopted for this evaluation. This will provide impact estimates for the program. ○ Qualitative analysis - The qualitative interactions (FGDs / KIIs) and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. We will prepare thematic coding to identify patterns in data, draw narratives that can be used to triangulate the inferences gathered from analysis of the quantitative data. The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the KIIs using software such as Nvivo or Atlas.ti. ○ The program MEL objectives and KPIs (measured through the quantitative survey) would be analysed using the OECD DAC deﬁned six evaluation criteria – relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efﬁciency, impact and sustainability (RCEEIS). Application of these criteria on the indicators would help us determine if the intervention aligns with the needs of the community and the region, if it is compatible with other interventions in the region, if the project goals have been met, if they have been met in an economical and timely manner and the feasibility of scaling up based on the intervention’s sustainability. ○ Economic Evaluation (Cost Effectiveness Analysis) - The method of Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) would be used for determining the ‘efﬁciency’ parameter of RCEEIS. CEA provides the outcomes of the investment in programs as a simple ratio of costs to impacts. This helps us to use it as a measure to compare the cost efﬁciency of different programs and Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. ○ Interpretation of ﬁndings - The outcome indicators captured (for monitoring administration costs, participation of women, cost effectiveness of the pilot, cotton sustainably and traceability etc) and analysed using the RCEEIS evaluation criteria would then be tied back to the program objectives to understand the potential and feasibility of replicating and scaling up the pilot. ○ Presentation of ﬁndings and Report - The analysis of ﬁndings, key learnings and recommendations would be mentioned in detail in the ﬁnal report and a PPT. The report will also include an outlook on how a potential evaluation of the project based on the baseline could be conducted. ○ Approach for Monitoring and endline evaluation - The existing data value chains would be studied to understand the monitoring systems functioning at present. Post understanding of the gaps in the present monitoring systems, newer data collection and monitoring mechanisms could be deployed which are more suitable for the new community-based PURE approach of implementing Better Cotton programs. At the endline, the evaluation approach could look at a pre-post comparison of the KPIs while using the analytical lens of RCEEIS to help determine the extent of change in achievement of outcomes post the implementation of the PURE intervention.

Monitoring and Evaluation Framework 3.2.1. Theory of Change The new community-centric approach of rescoping boundaries of the producer units is mainly intended to solve for the shortcomings of the previous approach of using farmer lists for selecting farmers for participating in the Better Cotton programs. For the pilot project, the 3 producer units of INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23 covering most of Karim Nagar district and some parts of Warangal district in Telangana are being rescoped to form 1 large producer unit. The rescoped producer unit is expected to cater to a larger number of farmers (~10,000 per PU in contrast to ~3000 per PU initially) and cover a larger geographical area (~5000 hectares) as well. The new approach intends to do away with the pitfalls of the previous approach of having to invest massive efforts in maintaining and validating farmer lists every year while predominantly focusing on male farmers. The farm to gin traceability system was also proving to be arduous in the initial farmer lists approach, given the challenges of segregating ‘better’ cotton from the regular cotton. Rescoping the boundaries of the producer units is envisaged to have multi-pronged and cascading beneﬁts. The administrative burden on the ﬁeld workers would be heavily reduced, leading to them being able to spend more time on the capacity development of the Better Cotton farmers. The impetus for the program farmers then - to change their behaviour and adopt sustainable farming practices like reducing fertiliser / pesticide usage, optimal use of resources for soil, water and land conservation - increases manifold by virtue of the nudges provided by the ﬁeld workers / trainers on one hand and their peers on the other. Consistent adoption of sustainable cotton farming practices in the region then implies ease of segregating and licensing the cotton as ‘Better Cotton’. The above cascading effects are diagrammatically represented below in the theory of change for the program - Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The development of Key Performance indicators for the PU rescoping pilot project and the tools then rests fundamentally on understanding each of the activities of the intervention in detail. Hence, to begin with, we would need to have in-depth discussions with the Better Cotton team and the teams working on the ﬁeld. Our understanding of the program activities at present (based on the review of documents shared) and the queries that we have are listed below - 1. PU governance and staff structure - It is understood that the stafﬁng structure will undergo a dramatic change post the implementation of the intervention. A rescoped PU will function under a uniﬁed management system, with a singular set of administrative and documentation requirements. The primary unit of implementation will be the ‘Village’, and not the ‘Learning Groups’ developed for the regular implementation mode. The Project managers would be Programme Partner staff, same as in the current model. The rescoped PU would be overseen and administered by a board of managers as opposed to just one PU Manager. This board would comprise one PU Manager (PUM) responsible for overall administration and management (including HR, planning and priority setting, overseeing the management system, etc.), one Manager dedicated to Capacity Strengthening and fostering necessary technical expertise, and one Manager focused on Data, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Documentation purposes. The board of managers would be assisted by Associate Managers, each responsible for implementation within speciﬁc geographical sub-units. As the PURE model shifts away from the individualistic farmer-based approach to embrace a broader perspective, Field Facilitators (FFs) could establish committees at the village level. These committees may include lead farmers, progressive farmers, demonstration farmers, and other relevant members to facilitate peer learning, mobilisation for Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

A thorough knowledge of the new and old governance structures is necessary for deﬁning indicators for the outcome associated with reduction in data and administration costs. 2. Periodic baseline and a new assurance model - The new monitoring system for the program seems to rely more on primary data collected in a digitised format at the community level (from FPOs) or from periodic baseline studies and utilises secondary sources of data like government data or gin procurement volumes. Other secondary data like satellite imagery, community data and interviews in schools would be used for triangulation of information. For answering the evaluation questions pertaining to this activity and its outcomes, we would need to understand the existing data value chain and the newer modiﬁcations to it clearly and in detail so that the tools and the indicators can be developed to probe into the efforts (time, cost, physical and mental) required for collecting data for the new approach vis-à-vis the previous one. 3. Participation in community-based capacity building activities - The intensiﬁcation of capacity strengthening efforts by the ﬁeld resources, directed at the community instead of individual farmers on predeﬁned lists, are supposed to be more effective in driving awareness and increased adoption of Better Cotton practices. Field Facilitators will be assigned villages instead of Learning Groups and will be accountable for implementation with all cotton farming households in the assigned villages, rather than solely focusing on farmers listed on the farmers list. However, one needs to be duly cognizant of the following aspects. a. Systemic non-compliance - A dichotomy arises due to the fact that participation in the program is voluntary on one hand while licensing, on the other, is intended to be done for all farmers at the community level. This situation then could inadvertently incentivise non-compliance. Free-riders can partake in the beneﬁts that the active producer unit participants would get. In order to evaluate the motivation behind and extent of participation in such a scenario, it is crucial for us to know the criteria for shortlisting farmers, their motivation to participate in the programs, the processes followed to onboard them into the program, extent of non-compliance allowed and the penalties for not complying with the program requirements. Further, frequency, duration and type of engagement of the farmers with the program is critical to understand as well - this entails understanding the nature of interaction between the farmer and the ﬁeldworker and the expectations from both parties. b. Focus on women participation - Increasing participation of women farmers is one of the key objectives of the intervention. However, to evaluate this objective it is important to understand the deﬁnition of women participation in the program - is the program looking at building the capacity of women for any speciﬁc program activities? What about their role in decision making? How will women&amp;#x27;s roles and responsibilities in cotton farming differ from the Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

How would their increased participation in cotton farming affect their domestic responsibilities? 4. Monitoring Evaluation and Learning - The approaches of replication, estimation or hybrid will be tested to check for the most effective way of monitoring data from the pilot. The data collection could either ‘replicate’ the way data is currently collected by PUs or it could be collected via ‘estimation’ which could involve estimating the data at a broader geographic level (from sources such as GIS maps, local traders, ginners etc) rather than per individual farmer. However, for the pilot, utilising the hybrid approach of collecting data for all indicators using both the replication and the estimation approach is being proposed. Results from both the methods would then be compared for better understanding of options for the future. 5. Segregation of Cotton and Traceability - So as to evaluate the credibility of the new traceability systems, it is important to understand the process followed for segregation of ‘better’ cotton from the regular one, the traceability and licensing measures adhered to on the ground at present, the dynamics of the stakeholders involved in the output value chain (from post harvest to ginning) and the changes that this system has undergone post the introduction of the PU with rescoped boundaries. Knowledge of this system is crucial so as to determine indicators for assessing traceability. 3.2.3. High level Indicators The indicators and tools could be suitably designed only once we have a thorough and detailed understanding of the Better Cotton Program. However, based on our understanding of the PU rescoping pilot project at present, we have identiﬁed the following indicators at a high level against the envisaged outcome / success criteria - Project Outcomes KPIs to monitor outputs and outcomes Stakeholders Data collection methods - 15% reduction in data collection and administration effort - Amount of time, cost &amp;amp; resources spent by ﬁeld staff on administrative and data collection efforts (time, cost and resources). Field staff Qualitative Survey and secondary data analysis - More effort spent on other activities more closely tied to impact. - Number of agronomists, extension workers and experts trained (disaggregated by gender).

While the achievement of the project success criterias (of increased participation and credible traceability of better cotton) would primarily contribute to the effectiveness of the rescoped PU program, reduction in administrative efforts (elicited from the cost effectiveness analysis) would help us understand the program’s efﬁciency. Moreover, even assessing the feasibility of scaling up the pilot (based on analysis of the KPIs) would give us an idea of the project&amp;#x27;s sustainability; the impact of the project could be determined appropriately at a later stage (post the endline).

This framework, originally known as the Harvard Analytical Framework (developed in 1985) would be used to identify the type and amount of work men and women do in a household, in cotton farming, and in the community. It also helps document the differences in the gendered access and control of resources, such as land, water, seeds or extension information.

Execution Approach The baseline study of the PU rescoping pilot will measure the values of program indicators before the implementation of the PURE intervention so that one can compare these with the indicators measured post the intervention to determine the success of the pilot. Based on our review of the documents shared on the PU pilot and the key performance indicators, some of the revisions proposed to the evaluation approach shared previously are as follows - ● Deﬁning output indicators in alignment with the KPIs - A thorough understanding of the program and the intervention (the PU approach being followed currently and the PURE approach respectively) is crucial for us to deﬁne output indicators for certain outcomes (such as level of conﬁdence in MEL and assurance, data and administration, credibility etc) in consultation with the program team. Clarity on the indicators is important given that they will be monitored at the baseline and the endline and will effectively be used to gauge the success of the pilot program. The indicators will also feed into the development of quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments for the study. Multiple conversations with the Better Cotton and WWF teams would be required in order to get this step right. ● Methods of data collection - While changes to the sampling numbers have not been proposed at present (assuming that we have accounted for the appropriate number of samples for quantitative and qualitative data collection), the data collection methods will be revised based on the type of the indicator measured. ○ We now understand that data on a lot of indicators such as the number of farmers reached, number of trainings attended, quantity of cotton produced, yield etc would be available to us from the program MIS (farmer ﬁeld books etc) and information for such indicators need not be collected through quantitative surveys. The program MIS would be thoroughly leveraged to get data on such relevant indicators at the baseline. The quantitative questionnaire then would be designed such that it focuses more on capturing the change in knowledge, attitude and practices of the farmers. ○ Since we want to measure a 15% decrease in the effort spent by the ﬁeld staff on data and administration, it is critical that all information for this outcome be measured quantitatively. Hence, for a predetermined sample of ﬁeld staff (selected accounting for factors of heterogeneity such as block, village, gender, mode of transport etc), information on effort required for administrative work would be measured quantitatively along with qualitative tools being employed to capture the intangible aspects of their work such as the challenges they face, their motivation etc ● Using the stakeholder input matrix for capturing and analysing their insights - The stakeholder input framework shared by Better Cotton would be used to capture and analyse the insights coming from the program stakeholders with respect to the challenges they faced, the changes in efforts and impact, activities that worked, Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

However, any such indicators could be proposed at a later stage and ﬁnalised in consultation with the Better Cotton team once we have developed a nuanced understanding of the program post having in-depth conversations with the WWF and Better Cotton teams on the program’s implementation.

Quality Control Mechanism With over 200 projects and an in-house portfolio for data collection, CMS has strong expertise in ensuring quality data collection and follows strong protocols in the data collection process. CMS has an expert network of senior enumerators with strong domain knowledge and past experience of working in the development sector. They are also trained on research ethics and the collection of sensitive information, etc. The selection of enumerators is based on stringent measures, and they are assessed for quality throughout the project. CMS will ensure that 100% of ﬁeld researchers selected are local in nature. They know the Telugu language, dialect, customs, and culture. They also easily understand the local terminologies used, giving them a stronger connection and rapport between researcher and Respondents. A detailed training and orienting process would be conducted prior to commencement of the data collection exercise. Training will be provided on all aspects of data collection including programme background, objectives and scope of the study, sampling techniques and replacement methodology, discussion on each question with probing methods, logistics planning and support. Given the nature of the study and the respondent type, gender sensitivity training will be administered tailored to speciﬁc needs and the context of the study population. A scientiﬁc approach to the training process will be ensured by creating standard training protocols, manuals including standardisation in survey techniques. Mock surveys and ﬁeld days are planned for the team for in-ﬁeld experience with the software and survey tool. Further, the enumerators are trained to hold all biases, opinions, claims, and other features that can be associated with individuals. They will also sign a conﬁdentiality agreement with CMS agreeing to use conﬁdential information only for the purposes set out in the training, and not disclose the information to any other party. The enumerators will be trained on the understanding to not copy or retain or share any written information or record that could be associated with identifying features of individuals or identifying features of any sort, after the study period. And that at the conclusion of the surveys all conﬁdential information, including questionnaires, written notes, photographs, or other types of notes taken would be given back to the team. During data collection, monitoring of data quality is one of the most important aspects of data collection. Therefore, the research team sets clear guidelines and protocols for the monitoring and quality assurance that include maintaining a real-time MIS dashboard of collection, minimising non-response with 2-3 attempts, ensuring enumerator quality controls with spot checks, back checks (on major topics, time taken, etc.) and looping mechanisms. The CMS team has robust processes for data management. The quantitative data is stored online on secured servers synched in real-time that ensure data security. All hard copies of the research notes, qualitative interviews, etc. are scanned and uploaded almost in real-time to avoid any loss of data. Data cleaning is perhaps the most critical step between data collection and data analysis. CMS believes that it is a rigorous process, and that the quality of the analysis is correlated Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Most of the data validation exercise is completed in real-time to avoid post-cleaning efforts including id variable checking, outlier tagging, missing values and replacements, illogical value assessment, addressing typos, survey codes, missing values and adding labels. Irregularities and corrections are identiﬁed and documented, but changes are made only after introspection with the ﬁeld team and the qualitative insights. 3.5.

Etc. She cross checks the data with farmer = Computer - Attendance: She maintains the LG book where farmers are supposed to sign after the meeting. = Hardcopy - Training &amp;amp; CS activities: She conducts farmer trainings - Adoption: She conducts demos to show how to do sowing of inter crops and how to use the bio fertilizers. She also motivates them to adopt sustainable practices. - RIR - She is responsible for cross checking data in FFB. Sometimes farmers inflate costs and they are quickly able to understand because they have data from other farmers. FFB - She assists farmers in filling the FFB, then signs and takes a picture of it for record. - Vanitas day starts at 7:30 AM &amp;gt;&amp;gt; goes to the field then goes to office after lunch - enters data from morning sessions - She is assisted by the APU manager and PU manager at times - Training timings are discussed and finalized on whatsapp groups, at times - Daily activities - calling farmers to arrange for training, conducting the trainings, data &amp;amp; admin work, Female farmer trainings - During training she makes use of Flex and believes that it is very useful for farmers to understand concepts easily. Farmers also find it easier to grasp concepts when shown through pictures on a flex. - T opics covered: Water management, biodiversity, soil health management, storage of cotton. - Nearly 20 to 30 farmers participate in every training session. - Farmers who miss the training, FF goes and meets them on field and educates them on the topics that he or she missed. - After meetings, farmers who have attended the training are made to sign in the LG book. - She maintains a diary for noting all points related to the trainings - Soil testing is also conducted - after the results she goes and talks to them and advises them, if need be. - In a month she conducts 3 to 4 meetings - Till date, two rallies have been held on PPE Kits and child labour. - Administration: ½ hr - diary entry, 2-3 hours office data work - During season there is data entry work every day which takes 2 to 3 hours daily - Off season it is only 1-2 hours - Overall : 50-70% time goes in admin work on a monthly basis - Farmers list - 10 to 15 mins daily - Attendance list - 15 to 10 mins daily - Capacity strengthening - 3 hours daily - Adoption - ½ - 1 hour daily - RIR - 1 hour - FFB - ½ hour - Demo - weekly once -2 hours - Overall - Admin: 30%, Data work: 40%, CS: 20 to 30% - She wants to spend more time on training because excessive data work gives her shoulder and eye pain and she finds interacting with farmers more fruitful. - Given an option she would reduce her data entry work - Motivation for being FF - Vanita used to previously deal with farmers and also work in the children&amp;#x27;s rights domain. She enjoys farming and believes that women farmers have more ideas than men. She said that BC encourages farmers to share their ideas and keep them inspired. Additionally, she believes that the highest profits are reaped from farming the organic way. - Highest impact work : Training, phone follows ups, one to one interactions with farmers and field workers. - Vanitha believes that data is very important as it tells us a story and based on that they conduct the trainings. Incorrect data and delays in data sharing involving repeated follow up which becomes time consuming. - As per Vanita, doing organic farming yields higher quality cotton - As per Vanita, her responsibilities which will benefit the farmers more is - an increase in her field time and scheduling meetings as per farmers availability (in the afternoon instead of morning) - Vanita feels that there is scope for improvement in efficiency of admin work and also she feels she can increase her knowledge in order to provide more information to the farmers. When asked about her overall experience, she said she has gathered more information to communicate with farmers in BCI, performed soil testing, and visited farmers&amp;#x27; gatherings in village GPs. Field notes_FF_Vanita FF2 - Rakesh (INTL 02)- Rakesh has six villages and 445 farmers under him - He has been FF since 2 years - When asked about the tools for management, used by FF, Rakesh mentioned that he uses his mobile phone for almost every work. He has to click photos and share with PUM on a daily basis - this leads to a lot of data and ultimately hangs up his phone. He said it would be nice if BC would provide them with tabs. Attendance: Minutes of every meeting / training is made by the FF. If he cannot make it in the meeting then he goes to his office and prepares the detailed version. Sign of every farmer is also taken in the LG attendance book after every meeting. FFB: Rakesh helping illiterate farmers in filling FFB. He said that literate farmers are able to fill the data correctly and the illiterate farmers usually make mistakes so we tell them to carry it during the meeting. Adoption data: - Rakesh said that he has the printout of the adoption data table and as per every farmer - the practices he follows, he ticks the relevant practices. - This data is then sent to the PUM - who further checks it and then enters in the computer. RIR: FF has nothing to do with RIR - only from FFB transfer to excel - this excel is an internal doc made by WWF (not as complex as RIR) - He meets with minimum 2 LGs per day - As per season training topics are taken up , one meeting lasts for one hour. - 1 LG - 1 adoption sheet - 15 days - training on 1 topic across all villages under him- FFs discuss with PUMs on topics to teach farmers. The meetings are conducted by Rakesh alone ( no supporting staff) - only some meetings PUM attend like on child labour, only-women meetings - once a month. APUM checks once in 15 days if we are having meetings or not. - General topics covered: soil health, biodiversity, how to increase fertility of land, reduction in water pollution, etc. - Rakesh said that they provide green gram and red gram seeds to RA (regenerative agriculture) Demo farmers, not all the farmers. By helping reduce their investment costs, we&amp;#x27;ve gained their trust, and they attend our meetings regularly. As a voluntary organization, we share valuable information, which strengthens their trust in us. During meetings, we explain the use of combination medicines, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, which encourages their continued participation. - When asked on how he reaches out to farmers who do not attend meetings - he said he does home visits, follows up with them on phone and gives them a download of all the topics discussed and urges them to attend the following meetings. - Rakesh mentioned that he sometimes goes to SHG meetings where he finds all the women - he educates them on kitchen gardening, tailoring, knowledge on PPE kits, etc. - Once the cotton is plucked, Rakesh provides suggestions on storage - for eg. to keep it away from water, open storage better, etc. - His day starts at 6:30 AM, farmers are already informed about the meeting the previous evening. He gives training for one hour followed by field visits / observations: 30 mins - Office work : 3 hours - In may &amp;amp; dec - well monitoring - 3 villages - Overall: Admin: 20% , Data: 30%, Capacity strengthening: 50% - Rakesh mentioned that he doesn&amp;#x27;t like (feels it is a time waste) to transfer well monitoring data from field to g sheets - it is not required - He said that instead this time could be used to train farmers who are not growing cotton but other crops like maize, paddy, etc. - When asked about the time taken for Farmers list - Rakesh said it takes 15 to 20 minutes from each farmer and it takes 2 to 3 days to collect info from one village and for all villages under him 10 to 15 days (annually - since farmer list is updated every year) When asked about what he would like to work more upon and what work he would like to reduce - - He said he would like it if data documentation work was reduced. Few farmers do not update / enter the wrong data -in their FFB, as a result of which data for RIR gets affected. When asked about how he knows that the correct info is filled in FFB he mentioned that the literate farmers fill data properly and he helps the illiterate ones. - Rakesh is interested in conducting training - He said that data is important as it supports farmers indirectly and also helps in monitoring their work. - Previously, farmers were investing Rs. 18,000 per acre, but now their expenditure has reduced to less than Rs. 15,000. - Before participating in the BCI project, farmers were heavily using DAP based on their own knowledge, but it wasn&amp;#x27;t yielding the expected results. - Rakesh also mentioned that they are providing vegetable seeds and connecting farmers with tailoring units, while also supplying more seeds for kitchen gardens. - Through their Sustainable Land Management efforts, they have distributed plants to farmers in partnership with WWF. Additionally, they also provide border crops, such as coconut trees, to protect farm boundaries and help retain soil moisture. Motivation of Rakesh: - “I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” - Rakesh feels immense pride that he has been able to reduce fertilizer usage which led to increase by 10 to 12 quintals per acre - When asked what he feels has been the impact of his work - &amp;quot;I never recommend using pesticides; instead, I advocate for organic fertilizers like neem oil and homemade preparations. We use Agni Asram, neem, and Jeevamrutham, all of which are prepared on agricultural land. The soil quality has remained stable. We’ve organized rallies in villages to discourage the use of red-colored pesticides. During meetings, we conducted an intercropping demonstration using green grams, which not only increased soil carbon but also provided farmers with an additional income. We are also developing vermicompost.&amp;quot; - Rakesh has till date conducted over 50 trainings for farmers - he conducts meetings with other stakeholders too like workers, schools, ANMs, etc.) - Overall, Rakesh said he feels he has created a 70% impact and there is still scope for improvement. - As per Rakesh, there is a clear difference between BCI &amp;amp; non-BCI cotton - quality, color and fibre, etc. - As per Rakesh, the highest impact of his work has been by educating farmers on bio pest, cow urine and cow dung - T o have meetings at night (6:30 to 8:30 PM) - since farmers are free at that time - Rakesh feels that the cultivation of Better Cotton is on the rise. He particularly appreciates the use of bio- pesticides and the preparation of neem oil by farmers. - A mixture of 5 kg cow dung, 5 liters of cow urine, 5 kg of jaggery, and soil is also used, and he finds this method effective. - Farmers are also preparing and using Trichoderma, which he highly values. Stem application is another method he favors; out of 30 farmers, 20 are using it. - This technique effectively eradicates sucking insects. What he loves most about stem application is that it prevents soil and environmental pollution, unlike spraying, which can cause harm. By applying directly to the plant stem, we ensure no damage to the soil or the environment. (about stem application usage: Sixty percent of farmers are using stem application. Just 250 ml is sufficient for two acres. While spraying costs around Rs. 1,000, stem application costs only Rs. 200. It also saves time, taking just one hour compared to two for spraying. Overall, the investment is significantly lower. This method has been implemented since two years) FF - Rakesh FF 3 - Ramesh (INTL23)Monthly Planning and Execution: Prepare and implement the Monthly Action Plan. This includes planning village visits, scheduling meetings, and conducting awareness programs based on seasonal requirements. Coordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information. Reporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives. Documentation: Maintain and verify Farmer Field Books (FFBs), write in diaries, and submit meeting minutes and signatures to the Field Manager.Data Collection and Validation: Collect data from Lead Farmers, validate farmer lists through physical visits and phone calls, and update records accordingly. Ensure the accuracy of data by cross-checking information. Monitoring Farmer Practices: Monitor farmers&amp;#x27; adherence to guidelines, especially regarding the use of organic fertilizers and pesticides, and follow up to ensure continued compliance. Result Indicator Reporting (RIR): Track and report on key performance indicators related to farmer practices and crop outcomes. Data Validation: Cross-check data over the phone and through physical visits. Ensure data is updated and accurate. Monitoring: Regularly monitor farmer practices, particularly the use of organic fertilizers and adherence to guidelines. Training and Awareness Programs: Conduct training sessions and awareness meetings with farmers on topics such as crop management, pesticide use, and environmental protection. Use Farmer Field Books (FFBs) to educate farmers on record- keeping. Material Distribution and Demonstrations: Distribute educational materials like flexes, demonstrate techniques such as using sticky traps, and share videos via WhatsApp groups to reinforce training. Promoting Sustainable Practices: Encourage the adoption of sustainable farming practices, including the use of Navadhanyalu (nine types of seeds) and reducing the use of chemical pesticides. Training Sessions: 30-40 minutes per session. Field Visits: Daily from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with specific timings for meetings and fieldwork. Post Noon - Office works mostlyEnvironmental Benefits: Reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, increased use of organic fertilizers, and improved environmental protection. Farmer Benefits: Increased yield, reduced investment, and improved education for farmer children due to higher profits. Adoption of Practices: High adoption rate of guidelines among farmers, 80% following the recommended practices.Data Management: Ensuring accurate data collection and validation can be time-consuming Farmer Engagement: Not all farmers consistently maintain their Farmer Field Books - so have to sit and write diaries with themEnhancing Female Participation: Plan and conduct more separate meetings for women farmers to increase their participation, especially considering the constraints they face such as domestic responsibilities and long distances. Use of T echnology: Integrate more audiovisual tools in training sessions to enhance understanding and retention among farmers.Sustained Engagement Needed: Continued follow-up and engagement are crucial to prevent farmers from reverting to less sustainable practices if the project ends. Capacity Building for Field Facilitators was asked by Ramesh Field Facilitator - Ramesh FF 4 - Sony (INTL01)Coordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information. Reporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives.Collects and verifies data through FFB, field visits, and phone calls. Conducts RIR data collection, analyzing investment, expenditure, and profit. Ensures accurate documentation and cross-checking of farmer information. Provides home visits for women who miss the training sessions and follows up with farmers who need additional guidance. Engages with SHG groups to increase female participation in the BCI program. Provides training on organic farming practices, pesticide reduction, and PPE usage. Engages with SHG groups, conducts awareness sessions, and facilitates stakeholder meetings. Organizes field visits, demonstrations, and rallies to promote sustainable agriculture. Visits 6 villages weekly; schedules meetings based on farmer convenience. Daily Schedule: Field visits: 7 AM to 12:30 PM. Office work, including documentation: 2 PM to 5 PM. Specific T asks: Data collection for the farmer list: 1 month (April and May). RIR data collection per farmer: 40-60 minutes. Training sessions: 45 minutes to 1 hour. Demonstrations: 20 minutes. Home visits and follow-up meetings: Varies depending on the farmer&amp;#x27;s availability.Significant reduction in pesticide use with a shift towards organic fertilizers. Yield increase: Previously 7-8 quintals, now 10-11 quintals Increased participation of female farmers due to targeted outreach through SHG meetings and home visits. Effective implementation of PPE kitsRIR data collection is time-consuming, documentation of investment, expenditure, and profit for each farmer takes nearly 1h or more time. Incorrect information provided by farmers due to lack of knowledge or skepticism/lack of trust of the FF at the initial stage. Reluctance to share information directly for the fear of losing out on govt schemes, requiring additional time for explanation and persuasion. Reliance on mobile phones for data entry, which is not always efficient. Suggestion to reduce documentation work to allocate more time for fieldwork and training. Customized tablets to improve data management. Female Participation: Suggestions to link livelihood programs (tailoring, packing systems, embroidery, vegetable seeds packing) to increase female participation and empowerment. Program Support: Requests from farmers for additional support in providing PPE kits, which are currently unaffordable for many.Lack of irrigation facilities is a significant challenge mentioned by farmers, so the FF would like BC to facilitate them. The FF expressed pride in their role and its impact on farmers&amp;#x27; knowledge and income. The current frequency of meetings with the PU Manager and Assistant PU Manager is deemed sufficient, with regular follow-ups and discussions.Sony_FF_Budidapally INTL01 - Interview PUM Walkthrough of the program / general overview Impact of the program Roles and responsibilities of the PU Manager (for Administration) Roles and responsibilities of the PU Manager (for MEL) Roles and responsibilities of the PU Manager (for Capacity Building) Time taken for each task Challenges/concerns in execution of responsibilities (admin and MEL)Areas for improvement Additional comments Link to transcript Sindhu (INTL 01) - Sindhu is working as PUM from 2 years - Program objectives as per Sindhu: Increase soil organic carbon, reduce pesticide toxicity, increase incomes, women empowerment and regenerative agriculture - Based on this we prepare activities that are locally relevant and we implement it on field through FFs - 9 FFs (incl. APUM) and 43 villages under Sindhu, 3018 farmers - From 2012 WWF has been part of this project. - Governing structure (from bottom level) - Farmer, FF, PUM, Navkranti FPCL, Project coordinator (WWF), BCI - Sindhu reports to project coordinator - Satish - Impact of work on BCI objectives: Initially the soil organic carbon - 0.32 now it is 0.38 Women empowerment has increased Increase in adoption practices - Factors contributing to the success of the program: Our hard work &amp;amp; FFs contribute to the success of the program - Highest impact: Working on the field, field interactions and conducting trainings - Lowest impact: Documentation is difficult. But data is important. - Aspects of work which are complex: Doing the compilation is a task and laborious work. She has told BCI many times to reduce the documentation. (BCI in process of developing an app for direct data entry) - Time allocation of which of your responsibilities could be changed: Sindhu likes going on the field and conducting training - she said that farmers are also keen to learn and know more about tech (PB Knot, Cremigel, etc.) if we train them on this they are interested in its implementation. Role of Sindhu under various categories of work: HR: Recruitment of FF (based on experience &amp;amp; knowledge in farming, communication skills, motivation) After selecting she shares with Satish sir. Finance, Accounts : NA Project management: - Her day starts at 6:30 - 7 AM. FFs arrange for the farmers, then Sindhu goes and gives them training for an hour. If any farmer wants Sindhu to visit farm then she goes there too. - By 11:30-12 - home and lunch - By 1:30 - 2 - back to office (Huzurabad) - half an hour to one hour she talks to FF - understands their challenges, learnings, etc. - Then she does documentation work - Presently working on farmers list (updating last year list and entering farming data), well monitoring data (groundwater levels data), compiling of soil testing (this not everyday, from every 43 village 4 or 5 samples from each - cross checking of data) Minutes of training taken by FF - Sindhu cross checks that - Soil testing completed in may-june. Distributed soil health card to farmers and now compiling data .. - Intercropping demo, stem application demo - to whom to give, etc. - Any work she finds complex - nothing as such, she is managing everything - Role of APUM - field visits with one FF, training, documentation verification &amp;amp; monitoring - after coming to office we cross check with FF, etc. - Based on season, she decides which villages to go to - for eg. if any village has started with land prep then will prioritize that over another which has not yet. Coordinator and facilitation of external assessment : NA Processes under MEL: - Cross checking: For each document there is a % which she cross checks. From each FF, 10 to 20% data is considered. So say if an FF has 4 villages under her - from each village 10% is considered and that sample is called and cross checked. - Each list / document is cross checked 10-20% (if the population is high) and 5 to 10% (if population is low) - This % was fixed internally by WWF. - APUM cross checks 40 to 50% - Project coordinator checks 3 to 5% - As per her, this process is reliable. If she finds any issues - she again tells the FF to cross check - so the process is very reliable. - Data is collected in google sheets, hard copies. Every document has a hardcopy - little difficult to manage but major data on google sheets. Management strategies: - We have a monitoring sheet with us when we go on field, she notes down in the sheet. - She also carries her diary and makes notes of suggestions, etc. We also come back and discuss with KVKs. - There is a whatsapp group of FFs + KVKs - so if FFs are unable to answer anything, they step in and answer. - Whatsapp group of only FFs + Sindhu - Whatsapp group with farmers - Village wise whatsapp group also - They put weather forecast info also - These groups also help farmers who have missed training to come to speed Factors that driver her: Her parents were farmers, she is interested in this and has a degree as well in soil science. Number of lists: Soil health (soil organic carbon, etc. is analyzed, we cross check if decreased or increased) &amp;gt; Early season estimates (farmers list) &amp;gt; well monitoring&amp;gt; Demos are planned &amp;gt; PRA data &amp;gt; Activity / monitoring plan &amp;gt; adoption plan &amp;gt; FFBs &amp;gt; RIR (post harvest estimates) What is the Farmers list approach? LGs, farmer codes for individual farmers, co farmers, irrigation data etc. (for responsibilities wrt each list see detailed transcript) How is the sample collected? - APUM - 40 to 50% of type of data, PUM - 10%, Satish sir - 3 to 5% - Demos are held based on seasons - for eg. sowing then spraying and Rallies (staff and villagers walking together with placards) are held in sept - august - for eg. not to use highly chemical pesticides, use PPE Kits, etc. - this way even Non - BC farmers get educated. Time spent on MEL work - Season wise lists are prepared - so her work also varies accordingly. Currently time for farmers list so her 1-2 weeks goes in that. After that some other data set.- We train the FFs depending on season &amp;gt;&amp;gt; that they teach farmers - Communication material carried by FFs - flexes, pamphlets, door stickers. - We give special trainings also - to anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare workers, pesticide sprayers, school children - we tell them about Child Labour, to be away from hazardous chemicals, focus on education, etc. - Every year 6 farmer trainings for each LG - she has 97 LGs - Each village 3-4 special activities / trainings - PUM role - Motivating farmers, if FFs cannot clarify anything then PUM comes in. - She is not sure if there is any efficient way to improve the MEL processes. She feels the current way is good. - Data is important - it helps understand if our training is working or not. Overall: Admin: 10%, Data: 60%, CS: 30% Sindhu wants to spend more time with farmers and less on documentation. If BCI gives any alternative then she would be happy. She would like to replace her data admin work with field work. Data entry burden must be reduced - cross checking, duplication data, etc. no challenges faced in execution - Any given farmer - may be growing multiple crops on his 5-6 acres of land. In such cases we train on other crops also - if farmers have queries on other crops we answer. - In paddy farming, work is much less compared to cotton - once transplantation is done for paddy - farmers just go to farm daily switches on pump machines and that&amp;#x27;s it. But for cotton, everyday farmers have to go and some or other work is there. Water availability is high here so many are opting for paddy. Field notes_Sindhu_PUM --- Page 2 --- KPI 1: 15% reduction in effort (time) on data and admin by field staff so they can spend more on work that drives impact e.g., More time with capacity building so farmers benefit more More time doing what they like and thus ‘happier’ field facilitators Stakeholders for KPI 1 - FF, PUM, Project Coordinator Field Facilitor Respondent / ThemeRoles and responsibilities of the field facilitator (Administration) Roles and responsibilities of the field facilitator (MEL) Roles and responsibilities of the field facilitator (Capacity Building)Time taken for each task Impact of the Program Challenges in execution of responsibilities (admin and MEL)Areas for improvement Additional comments Link to transcript Nikita (INTL 23) - She has been the PUM since one year Objectives as per Nikita: to identify cotton farmers and increase their yields, support farmers from sowing to harvesting, to empower women, increase soil organic carbon and decrease GHG emissions. - 50% chance that farmers will adapt to activities easily accessible to them. Accordingly we make activity plan and conduct demos, training, etc. all this is based on local context, so that it is easy for them to adopt to it. - Farmers feel a bit uncomfortable in PPE Kit - we make them aware of its importance and disadvantages of not wearing it - Annually six trainings have to be conducted every LG Highest impact: Giving training &amp;amp; demos to farmers is very crucial - it is very important for FFs to be knowledgeable. Every aspect of BCI should be known by FF only then he will be able to explain to farmers. Low impact: Demos are only for few farmers (as impossible to give all farmers the inputs) - many farmers said that we come for training but you select only few. Nikita feels that if demos are done on a larger scale it will be more beneficial. Nikita said that the Demos have been crucial - there are cross learnings since farmers tell other farmers the benefits they have gained. Because of this even other farmers become curious to practice the same. At times it is difficult for them to understand that pesticides are harmful because the yields initially drop. So farmers are worried about this - other than this they follow most of the things. Complex work: documentation work is complex - sometimes we are not able to concentrate on training because of excessive data work. HR: Preliminary screening of candidates - and then send to Sindhu or Satish Finance, Accounts: NA Project Management: - T o build activity plan according to which trainings are conducted as per pre determined timeline, Deadlines are fixed - cross checked, etc. Coordinator and facilitation of external assessment: Self assessment, CB to FFs Others : Documentation work, Monthly twice review meetings, Daily field updates - we check FF phones if they have invited farmers and if few farmers have not attended why they have not attended. Systems &amp;amp; processes: Yearly there is an activity plan - Nikita makes a to do plan every day and mentions deadlines for long term plans. In the internal FF review meetings (which is held twice monthly) she discusses a 15 day work plan with them. T ools used : Diaries, for FFs she uses board and for data computer Factors that drive you to execute your duties: Personal interest in animals and nature. After her masters in Zoology, she was interning with WWF under Biodiversity Restoration project. She believes that if the environment is friendly then only the animals will survive. That is why she propagates using organic fertilizers. She believes that BCI principles are very close to her ideologies.What data she handles? - Annually, we have to make a time bound plan, for which we have to know the key issues - collected by FF. This year we have an activity plan then a monitoring plan. - Soil sample testing - after that data compiled by FF, she puts it in the computer in prescribed BC format and then shares it to the project coordinator. - Action plan for FFs every month activities - Locally used pesticides list - Disadvantage list: we identify physically handicapped people and provide them livelihood - we try to collaborate with govt. Schemes - Degraded lands identification - degraded lands identified and then restoration plan - FFB updation (routine) - Adoption - RIR How does she manage the data ? - Every data is seasonal and accordingly we share hard copies with FF - T ools used for handling data: Hardcopies, internal WWF excel templates which FF fill and give me, google sheets are also used. - FF collect data from farmers and then give to PUM &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PUM checks / calls or one to one contact with farmers and rectify any issue &amp;gt;&amp;gt; - APUM also checks the data &amp;gt; PUM &amp;gt; Project coordinator About farmers list - Annual updation - FF goes to the village and identifies cotton growing farmers and enrolls them. FF collects the data - if anyone is not growing cotton anymore then the same is mentioned. We filter him out and add new farmer. Types of data collected: See the detailed transcript Sample selection - randomly Steps taken to ensure quality and integrity of data collected: - She always cross checks. In the farmer list , we randomly select 10 farmers and call them up to cross check info. If there is a mismatch, then Nikita goes to FF and tells them to cross check the entire data from her end. - 10% of sample size is chosen by me and if there is a mistake the full list is to be checked by FF. - APUM cross checks data and sometimes APUM also fills in data. - Note: PUM checks 10% from every village data - so FF may have 5 villages under him or her - 10% of every 5 villages (50). APUM checks 20 to 30% .. and project coordinator 3 to 5% - Trainings are conducted across 55 villages on the 6 BCI principles (55* 6). We also talk about RA practices (30 practices) - there is no separate training for this. In the same training we suggest farmers to do certain activities. - Trainings conducted till date: 12 *2 = 24 trainings - Frequency of the training: 1 FF will reach the same village twice a month. - At times, farmers are not interested in listening to me - most farmers are eager to get some input Overall: Admin: 5% (Since sindhu helps her in most admin work), Data: 60%, CS: 35% BCI had told us documentation will reduce, even though it has reduced we have to maintain some docs to show proof of farmers adhering to program objectives. It will be better if we get more time on field than data entry work, and will be better in understanding issues faced by farmers. Do you think the MEL systems are efficient? 10% is currently done, for the errors to lessen it would be better if we considered 20 to 30% . Due to heavy documentation work it becomes difficult. Challenges in execution / managing the PU position: - Deadlines are strict and sometimes we dont get data on time from farmers. For FF also it is difficult to collect data from farmers The above issue does not have effect on final project outcomes - Before BC project deadline, Satish sir has a deadline Collection of data should be done in another way so that it is easier to fill in data. No issue in CS since Satish sir always there with us.Field notes_Nikita_PUM Project Coordinator - Satish Botla Roles and responsibilities of the Program Partner (for Administration)Roles and responsibilities of the Program Partner (for MEL) Roles and responsibilities of the Program Partner (for Capacity Building)Time taken for each task Impact of the Program Challenges/concerns in execution of responsibilities (admin and MEL)Areas for improvement Additional comments About Ginners Transcript Satish Botla. WWF PC - Satish is a consultant for WWF India , POC for BCI - Administrative + technical support for Karimnagar cluster, since 2012 (for other clusters - Satish assists in technical work) Responsibilities: Divided in Admin &amp;amp; T echnical Broad responsibilities: Data collection for project proposals Submission of Annual data to BCI CB of staff, planning for farmer training - Satish mainly responsible for staff trainings (TOT) planning , cross checking of documentations, training, action plans, corrective action plans, project review, analysis of results, - his broad responsibilities Under technical - Developing materials (like BCI principles recently changed - Satish translated in local language) includes material for training (PUMs and FFs), plan for conducting trainings - PUM &amp;amp; FFs, Also involved in BCI licensing assessments (whatever support required from WWF), CAP Under Admin Monitoring - Satish visits the fields at least 2 to 3 times a week. He talks to them, understands their issue, takes inputs from them, etc. During internal review he discusses this with PUM (once a month) PUMs also conduct stock taking meeting with FFs one in 15 days (for each and every document there is a detailed monitoring protocol. For eg. FFB - Field staff will monitor 10%, PUM 3%, APM 5%, Satish 3% at project level not unit level) Monitoring, reviewing, staff recruitment (every village (earlier it was LG) has one demo farmer for whom we give green grams, biofertilizers, etc. and other activities) Farmers list (annual): Giving training to PUM - how to fill, etc. &amp;amp; to Cross checking by Satish before sending to BCI T ools used: They internally have made easy excels (not prescribed by BCI) key points required by BCI are shared with them, rest retained with us. Attendance list: NA (only when he goes on field he sees it - this comes mainly under the purview of FF / PUM) Training &amp;amp; CS activities: PUM and PU staff training,(farmer training - FFs / PUM responsible) Adoption , RIR - Same as CS activities FFB - No work but checks during field visits CS for farmers: Satish gives training to PUMs / Field staff, not directly to farmers. During CS activities, FF may not know the answer to every question farmers ask - they call Satish and ask him / whatsapp him.Admin: 20%, Data - Farmers list, Attendance, Training &amp;amp; CS, Adoption, RIR, FFB : 25-30% Trainings &amp;amp; CS: 25-30% Demos and Community level activities: 5-10% Max time in data and CS As per Satish, CB / CS and monitoring of fields of work are more helpful to farmers instead of data. Importance of Data : - Satish has discussed previously with BCI that such level of data collection is not required, data load is decreased alot now compared to 2012 -13 - Reasons for doing FFB activity: BCI says for Farmer learning and RIR data - After many years of back &amp;amp; forth: only 15% farmers in a PU are mandated to maintain FFB, rest voluntary. - No FFB was to be included in PURE - since farmers are interested in maintaining their own diary. Maintaining FFB also leads to increase in no. of training - how to fill, what units to fill, etc. - Satish said he would like to spend more time on training than being bogged down with data work - Satish had suggested that we (WWF) can make our own data templates to collect data - simple data - farmer name, village name, gender, mode of irrigation, contact - that&amp;#x27;s it. - Suggestion: Reduce data burden on FF / PUM. - Because of WWF - BC thought of implementing a project at global level (H&amp;amp;M) - Similarly for PURE, they are piloting with us (India) - this shows the trust they have in WWF. - None of the INTLs have lost any licensing - this speaks for our work. - We speak directly with BCI Before data comes to Satish, it is checked 2 times (PUM and APUM) - so if they do a good job in checking my challenges are reduced automatically, but no other challenges as such. - The Appointment of MEL, CB manager has helped me put more time in other priority work where I am needed more. - More focus to be on capacity building. - Lot of docs in BCI, soft copies (1 TB finished) - Separate MEL manager will help us do effective analysis - Data including work burden of PUM instead of CS, in the self assessment report (every PU has this) for so many years, i have always given feedback that data needs to reduce inorder for PUMs to concentrate on field work Opinion on PUM / FF work allocation Depends from person to person 75-80% of PUMs are doing well, 20-25% need to focus more on the project About Licensing: - Rigorous audits done by BC for licensing of PU - 4 days of audit - They choose the sample - not WWF. - Management - checking of docs, what are the planned activities, activity wise success indicators, etc. - Interview with PUM - They talk to PUM - as per BCI PUM, a very important / effective POC. - - They feel, if PUM is effective then the farmers will reap the benefits. Even the project - coordinator is not allowed to speak much during these meetings with PUM. - Field level - they will select some LGs (BC informs only 24 hours before about the sample to avoid any manipulation) -Farmer interviews are done- they ask BCI principles being followed are not - they check farmers knowledge and then the adoption - two main factors. - Other stakeholders - Workers - BC also interacts with field workers - Verifiers will cross check with fertilizer shops and cross check if they are selling organic fertilizers mentioned by farmers in the vicinity, - They also check with schools asking them if there is any child labor, etc. - Closing day - major findings are discussed - They prepare a report and submit it to BC India and they decide if the license will be continued or not. Types of licenses - Compliance with observation (means farmers may have knowledge but adoption is less - so they will give chance to see if there is any growth happening) - 64 Indicators under BCI - non-compliance with any one of the indicators - license is lost. - Licensing done once in three years. INTL 23 is pending for licensing this year. INTL 01 and 02 got licenses in the last 2 years. About ginners - Supply chain very big challenge in BCI - BC program farmers do not necessarily go to BC licensed Ginner - BC program farmers wanted more money per quintal - premium - Ultimate benefit of this project is to the environment - Biggest cotton market - Jammikunta - Rs. 100- 150 price higher compared to other markets. Reason: There are a lot of ginning mills in Jammikunta, so prices are competitive. - There is a BCI portal for registered ginners and spinners. - Ginners are not getting a lot of benefit and hence are not keen on continuing with the license.

Every village has close to 40 to 50 farmers. Vanita is passionate about training farmers and sharing her knowledge with them. If given the choice, she would prefer to dedicate more of her time to trainings over data entry work. Vanita&amp;#x27;s responsibilities are varied and require meticulous attention to detail. She is in charge of gathering essential data for the Farmers List, which includes details like the farmer&amp;#x27;s name, acres of land, irrigation methods, and contact numbers. After collecting this information, she diligently cross-checks it with the farmers to ensure accuracy. \n\nFor attendance, Vanita maintains the LG book, a hardcopy record where farmers sign after each meeting, ensuring that participation is documented. When it comes to training and capacity-strengthening activities, Vanita is at the forefront, leading farmer training sessions and demonstrating sustainable agricultural practices. She conducts demos on intercropping and the use of biofertilizers, motivating farmers to adopt these environmentally friendly methods.\n\nIn her role, Vanita also oversees the accuracy of the data recorded in the Farm Field Books (FFB). She cross-checks this information, particularly focusing on instances where farmers might inflate costs. Her ability to verify this data is crucial, as it relies on comparisons with records from other farmers. Additionally, she assists farmers in filling out their FFBs, ensuring all information is correct. Once completed, she signs the books and takes photos for official records, maintaining a comprehensive and accurate account of the work being done. \n\nOverall, she spends 30% of her time on admin work, 40% of her time on data work and remaining 30% on CS activities. Vanita&amp;#x27;s day begins early at 7:30 AM, starting with a visit to the field to engage with farmers. After spending the morning in the field, she heads to the office after lunch to enter data from her morning sessions. Although she handles much of this work on her own, she occasionally receives assistance from the APU and PU managers, especially during busier times.\n\nThe timing of her training sessions is often discussed and finalized through WhatsApp groups, ensuring that both she and the farmers are on the same page. Her daily routine is a mix of calling farmers to arrange training, conducting these sessions, and managing data and administrative tasks. Vanita also dedicates time specifically to training female farmers.\n\nDuring her training sessions, Vanita makes effective use of Flex banners, which she believes are invaluable in helping farmers grasp complex concepts more easily. The visual aids, featuring pictures, make it simpler for farmers to understand topics such as water management, biodiversity, soil health management, and cotton storage. Each session typically sees the participation of 20 to 30 farmers.\n\nFor those farmers who miss the training, Vanita takes the extra step of meeting them in the field to ensure they are up to speed on the topics covered. After each meeting, she ensures that all attendees sign the LG book as a record of their participation. To keep track of everything discussed, Vanita diligently maintains a diary where she notes down key points from each training.\n\nVanita also conducts soil testing as part of her role. After receiving the results, she meets with the farmers to discuss the findings and provide advice where necessary. Over the course of a month, she typically conducts three to four meetings. Beyond these regular activities, Vanita has also been involved in organizing two rallies focused on the use of PPE kits and addressing child labor, reflecting her commitment to broader social issues affecting the farming community. Vanita&amp;#x27;s day is a balancing act between administrative duties and her passion for working directly with farmers. She spends about half an hour each day on admin work, followed by 2 to 3 hours of office data work. During the busy season, this data entry becomes a daily task, consuming 2 to 3 hours each day, while in the off-season, it drops to 1 to 2 hours. On a monthly basis, this adds up to a significant portion of her time—anywhere from 50% to 70%—being devoted to administrative tasks.\n\nEvery day, Vanita spends 10 to 15 minutes maintaining the Farmers List and another 10 to 15 minutes updating the Attendance List. Additionally, she dedicates half an hour to an hour daily to adoption activities, an hour to RIR tasks, and another half hour to assisting farmers with their Farm Field Books (FFB).\n\nTraining and capacity strengthening, which are central to her role, also occupy 3 hours of her day, with a demo conducted once a week that lasts for about 2 hours. When broken down, Vanita&amp;#x27;s overall time allocation is roughly 30% for administrative tasks, 40% for data work, and 20% to 30% for capacity strengthening and training activities.\n\nDespite her efficiency, Vanita finds the excessive data work physically taxing, causing shoulder and eye pain. More importantly, she feels that this time could be better spent on training and interacting with farmers, which she finds far more rewarding. If given the option, she would gladly reduce her data entry work to focus more on these impactful activities. Vanita&amp;#x27;s motivation for becoming a FF stems from her deep-rooted experience working with farmers and her background in the children&amp;#x27;s rights domain. She has always had a passion for farming, and she firmly believes that women farmers often bring more innovative ideas to the table than their male counterparts. This belief is reinforced by her work with BC, which actively encourages farmers to share their insights and keeps them motivated.\n\nFor Vanita, the most impactful aspects of her work are the training sessions, phone follow-ups, and one-on-one interactions with both farmers and field workers. These activities allow her to make a direct and meaningful difference in the lives of those she works with.\n\nVanita also recognizes the critical role that data plays in her work. She views data as a storyteller, providing valuable insights that guide the training sessions and other activities she conducts. This understanding underscores her commitment to using data effectively to maximize the benefits for the farmers she supports. The biggest challenge faced by Vanita is incorrect data and delays in data sharing, coupled with the need for repeated follow-ups, making the process time-consuming. Vanita firmly believes that organic farming results in higher-quality cotton, a conviction that drives her dedication to promoting sustainable practices among farmers. She recognizes that her work would be even more beneficial if she could spend more time in the field, directly engaging with farmers, and if meetings were scheduled according to the farmers&amp;#x27; availability, preferably in the afternoons rather than the mornings.\n\nVanita also sees potential for improving the efficiency of administrative tasks, which often take up a significant portion of her time. She is eager to enhance her own knowledge so that she can offer even more valuable information to the farmers, further supporting their efforts in achieving better results. When asked about her overall experience, she said she has gathered more information to communicate with farmers in BCI, performed soil testing, and visited farmers&amp;#x27; gatherings in village GPs. \n\nVanita believes that women farmers have more ideas than men and she actively encourages them to share ideas during training sessions. \n Field notes_FF_Vanita NaN FF2 - Rakesh (INTL 02) Rakesh, who has been a FF for two years, oversees six villages and is responsible for 445 farmers. In managing his duties, Rakesh relies heavily on his mobile phone for nearly every task. From taking photos in the field to sharing updates with the PUM daily, his phone has become an indispensable tool. However, the constant data handling often causes his device to freeze, making his work more challenging. Rakesh mentioned that it would be much more efficient if BC could provide them with tablets, which would better support the demanding nature of his job. Rakesh manages attendance data by recording the minutes of every meeting and training session. He ensures that each farmer signs the LG attendance book after every meeting, maintaining a thorough record of participation.\n\nWhen it comes toFFB, Rakesh provides crucial support to illiterate farmers, helping them accurately complete their entries. He notes that while literate farmers can generally fill out the data correctly on their own, the illiterate ones often make errors. To address this, Rakesh advises them to bring their FFBs to meetings where he assists them in making the necessary corrections.\n\nFor adoption data, Rakesh uses a printed table to track the farming practices followed by each farmer. He marks the relevant practices for each individual, and this data is then sent to the PUM for further verification and entry into the computer system.\n\nRegarding the RIR data, Rakesh&amp;#x27;s involvement is minimal. His role is confined to transferring data from the FFB to an Excel spreadsheet, which is an internal document created by WWF and is less complex than the RIR. Rakesh’s daily routine involves meeting with at least two LGs, each session focused on a specific training topic relevant to the season. Each meeting lasts about an hour,. Every 15 days, Rakesh organizes training on a specific topic across all the villages under his care, collaborating with the PUMs to determine the subjects to cover. While Rakesh handles these meetings on his own, the PUMs occasionally join for sessions on specific issues like child labor or women-focused meetings, typically once a month. The APUM checks in every 15 days to confirm that these meetings are taking place.\n\nThe training sessions cover a range of general topics, including soil health, biodiversity, land fertility improvement, and water pollution reduction. To support regenerative agriculture, Rakesh provides green gram and red gram seeds to demo farmers, which helps reduce their investment costs and builds their trust in the program. This trust is reinforced by sharing valuable information on combination medicines, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, which encourages regular participation in the meetings.\n\nFor farmers who miss these sessions, Rakesh takes a proactive approach by conducting home visits, making follow-up phone calls, and providing comprehensive summaries of the missed topics to encourage their attendance at future meetings. Additionally, he occasionally attends Self-Help Group (SHG) meetings, where he educates women on various topics such as kitchen gardening, tailoring, and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits.\n\nAfter the cotton is harvested, Rakesh offers practical advice on storage, recommending methods to keep the cotton away from water and suggesting open storage as a better option to preserve quality. Rakesh begins his day at 6:30 AM, with farmers having already been informed about the day&amp;#x27;s meeting the previous evening. He starts with an hour of training, followed by 30 minutes of field visits and observations. His office work consumes about three hours of his day. During May and December, he spends additional time monitoring wells across three villages. \n\nIn terms of time distribution, Rakesh dedicates 20% of his time to administrative tasks, 30% to data management, and 50% to capacity strengthening activities. He finds transferring well monitoring data from the field to Google Sheets to be a time-consuming task that he considers unnecessary. He believes that the time spent on this task could be better utilized training farmers who grow crops other than cotton, such as maize and paddy.\n\nUpdating the farmers&amp;#x27; list is another significant task. Rakesh estimates it takes him 15 to 20 minutes to collect information from each farmer, with the entire process for one village taking 2 to 3 days and for all villages under his purview, 10 to 15 days annually, as the list is updated every year.\n\nRakesh has expressed a desire to reduce the amount of time spent on data documentation. He noted that inaccurate or incomplete data entries in the FFB often impact the accuracy of the RIR. He helps illiterate farmers with data entry while literate farmers handle it correctly on their own. Rakesh is keenly interested in training and believes that while data is crucial for monitoring and supporting farmers, he would prefer to spend more of his time on direct training activities. Previously, farmers were spending around Rs. 18,000 per acre on cultivation. However, after joining BC program this expenditure has been reduced to below Rs. 15,000. Before joining the program, farmers relied heavily on DAP based on their own knowledge, but this approach did not yield the expected results.\n\nWhen asked about the impact of his work, at an FF level, he said that he has conducted over 50 training sessions for farmers, also engaging with various stakeholders such as workers, schools, and ANMs. Reflecting on his efforts, Rakesh estimates that he has achieved about 70% of the impact he aims for, acknowledging that there remains room for further improvement. He highlights that the most significant outcomes of his work have come from educating farmers on the use of bio-pesticides, cow urine, and cow dung, which have proven highly effective in enhancing their agricultural practices. Rakesh feels immense pride that he has been able to reduce fertilizer usage which has led to increase by 10 to 12 quintals per acre of farmers. \n\nMotivation of Rakesh: \n- “I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” \n\nWhen asked what he feels has been the impact of his work - &amp;quot;I never recommend using pesticides; instead, I advocate for organic fertilizers like neem oil and homemade preparations. We use Agni Asram, neem, and Jeevamrutham, all of which are prepared on agricultural land. The soil quality has remained stable. We’ve organized rallies in villages to discourage the use of red-colored pesticides. During meetings, we conducted an intercropping demonstration using green grams, which not only increased soil carbon but also provided farmers with an additional income. We are also developing vermicompost.&amp;quot; NaN Rakesh strongly suggested to have meetings at night (6:30 to 8:30 PM) - since farmers are free at that time \n Rakesh has highlighted several key improvements since the project began. The initiative now includes providing vegetable seeds and connecting farmers with tailoring units. Additionally, they are supplying more seeds for kitchen gardens, which supports both food security and local livelihoods.\n\nTheir Sustainable Land Management efforts have also made a significant impact. In collaboration with WWF, they have distributed plants to farmers and introduced border crops like coconut trees. These border crops not only protect farm boundaries but also help retain soil moisture, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nAs per Rakesh, there is a clear difference between BCI &amp;amp; non-BCI cotton - quality, color and fibre, etc. \n\nRakesh feels that the cultivation of Better Cotton is on the rise. He particularly appreciates the use of bio-pesticides and the preparation of neem oil by farmers. - A mixture of 5 kg cow dung, 5 liters of cow urine, 5 kg of jaggery, and soil is also used, and he finds this method effective. \n\nFarmers are also preparing and using Trichoderma, which he highly values. Stem application is another method he favors; out of 30 farmers, 20 are using it. - This technique effectively eradicates sucking insects. What he loves most about stem application is that it prevents soil and environmental pollution, unlike spraying, which can cause harm. By applying directly to the plant stem, we ensure no damage to the soil or the environment.\n\n(about stem application usage: Sixty percent of farmers are using stem application. Just 250 ml is sufficient for two acres. While spraying costs around Rs. 1,000, stem application costs only Rs. 200. It also saves time, taking just one hour compared to two for spraying. Overall, the investment is significantly lower. This method has been implemented since two years)\n FF - Rakesh NaN FF 3 - Ramesh (INTL23) As a Field Facilitator, Ramesh is responsible for the Monthly Planning and Execution of his field-related duties. He meticulously prepares and implements the Monthly Action Plan, which includes planning village visits, scheduling meetings, and conducting awareness programs that are tailored to the seasonal needs of the community. His proactive approach ensures that all activities are aligned with the program’s objectives and effectively address the community&amp;#x27;s requirements.\nIn the area of Coordination and Communication, Ramesh maintains consistent contact with farmers through calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. He collaborates with Lead Farmers, community heads, and other stakeholders to both gather and disseminate essential information. His effective communication ensures that everyone involved is informed and engaged in the program&amp;#x27;s activities.\n\nWhen it comes to Reporting, Ramesh diligently updates the Field Manager and PU Manager on the progress of the action plan. He provides detailed reports on any deviations from the plan, ensuring transparency and alignment with the overall program objectives. His thorough reporting is crucial for maintaining the integrity and success of the program.\n\nFor Documentation, Ramesh is responsible for maintaining and verifying Farmer Field Books (FFBs), recording entries in diaries, and submitting meeting minutes along with signatures to the Field Manager. His meticulous attention to detail in documentation ensures accurate records are kept, contributing to the program’s accountability and success. Ramesh diligently gathers data from Lead Farmers, ensuring that the farmer lists are accurate by conducting physical visits and making phone calls. This meticulous process of cross-checking information allows him to update records with precision, ensuring that the data is reliable and up-to-date. His thorough approach to data validation plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the program&amp;#x27;s database.\n\nIn his role, Ramesh is also responsible for Monitoring Farmer Practices. He keeps a close watch on how farmers adhere to the guidelines provided, particularly in the use of organic fertilizers and pesticides. By regularly following up with the farmers, Ramesh ensures that they continue to comply with sustainable agricultural practices. This ongoing monitoring is vital for promoting environmentally friendly farming methods and ensuring that the program&amp;#x27;s objectives are being met.\n\nRamesh also takes on the responsibility of Result Indicator Reporting (RIR), where he tracks and reports on key performance indicators related to farmer practices and crop outcomes. His reports offer valuable Ramesh plays a pivotal role in conducting Training and Awareness Programs for farmers. He organizes and leads training sessions and awareness meetings on essential topics such as crop management, pesticide use, and environmental protection. To enhance the farmers&amp;#x27; understanding, he utilizes Farmer Field Books (FFBs) as a tool to educate them on the importance of proper record-keeping. Through these programs, Ramesh ensures that farmers are well-informed and equipped with the knowledge they need to implement best practices in their fields.\n\nIn addition to training, Ramesh is responsible for Material Distribution and Demonstrations. He distributes educational materials, such as flexes, and conducts practical demonstrations on techniques like using sticky traps for pest control. To further reinforce the training, he shares informative videos through WhatsApp groups, making the information easily accessible to the farmers. These efforts help solidify the knowledge imparted during training sessions and encourage the adoption of these practices.\n\nRamesh is also deeply committed to Promoting Sustainable Practices among the farming community. He actively encourages farmers to adopt sustainable farming methods, such as the use of Navadhanyalu (nine types of seeds), which supports biodiversity and soil health. Additionally, he advocates for the reduction of chemical pesticides, promoting more environmentally friendly alternatives. Through these initiatives, Ramesh contributes to the long-term sustainability of agriculture in the region. Ramesh conducts Training Sessions that typically last between 30 to 40 minutes each. These sessions are designed to be concise yet informative, providing farmers with the essential knowledge they need in a focused timeframe.\n\nHis Field Visits are scheduled daily, starting early in the morning at 7:00 AM and continuing until 5:30 PM. During these visits, Ramesh engages in meetings and fieldwork, ensuring that he is present in the community to offer guidance and support throughout the day.\n\nIn the Post-Noon hours, Ramesh primarily focuses on office-related tasks. This time is dedicated to administrative duties, including updating records, preparing reports, and coordinating with other team members to ensure that all aspects of his work are well-organized and aligned with the program&amp;#x27;s goals. The program that Ramesh facilitates brings significant Environmental Benefits to the community. One of the key outcomes is the reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, which leads to a healthier environment and safer agricultural practices. Additionally, there is an increased use of organic fertilizers, which further enhances soil health and sustainability. These efforts collectively contribute to improved environmental protection, ensuring a more sustainable future for the region.\n\nFor the Farmers, the benefits are equally substantial. By adopting the recommended practices, farmers experience an increase in their crop yields, which directly translates to higher profits. This financial boost allows them to reduce their overall investment in farming inputs, creating a more cost-effective approach to agriculture. Moreover, the higher profits enable farmers to invest in the education of their children, improving opportunities for the next generation.\n\nThe program also sees a strong Adoption of Practices among the farming community, with an impressive 80% of farmers following the recommended guidelines. This high adoption rate underscores the effectiveness of the program and the positive impact it has on both the farmers and the environment. Data Management poses a significant challenge for Ramesh, as ensuring accurate data collection and validation is often a time-consuming process. The meticulous effort required to gather and cross-check data demands considerable attention to detail, which can be demanding given the scope of his responsibilities.\n\nFarmer Engagement also presents its own set of challenges. Not all farmers consistently maintain their Farmer Field Books, which can hinder the documentation process. As a result, Ramesh often has to spend additional time sitting with the farmers to help them write and update their diaries. This hands-on approach is necessary to ensure that records are properly maintained, but it adds an extra layer of effort to his already busy schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ramesh suggests Enhancing Female Participation by planning and conducting more separate meetings for women farmers. This approach aims to address the unique constraints they face, such as domestic responsibilities and long distances, thereby increasing their participation in the program.\n\nAdditionally, he recommends Using Technology to improve training sessions. By integrating more audiovisual tools, such as videos and interactive presentations, Ramesh believes that farmers will gain a better understanding and retention of the material covered. This method is intended to make the training more engaging and effective. NaN Field Facilitator - Ramesh NaN FF 4 - Sony (INTL01) Sony has been working with BC as an FF for the past 1 year. She has previously worked with Self Help Groups for a few years before becoming a full time employee at BC.\nSony has been working as a field facilitator for the past year and visits six villages under her once a week.\n\nHer main responsibilities are:\nCoordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information.\nReporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives. Sony is responsible for collecting and verifying data through Farmer Field Books (FFB), field visits, and phone calls. She conducts Result Indicator Recording (RIR) data collection, analyzing investment, expenditure, and profit related to agricultural activities. Ensuring accurate documentation is a key part of her role, along with cross-checking farmer information to maintain data integrity. \n\nSony provides support through home visits to women who miss training sessions, ensuring they receive the necessary guidance. She also follows up with farmers who need additional assistance. Her engagement with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) is crucial, as she actively works to increase female participation in the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) program, promoting gender inclusivity in agricultural practices.\n\n\n\n Sony provides training on organic farming practices, pesticide reduction, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). She engages with Self-Help Groups (SHGs), conducts awareness sessions, and facilitates stakeholder meetings. \nAdditionally, she organizes field visits, demonstrations, and rallies to promote sustainable agriculture. Sony visits six villages weekly, carefully scheduling meetings based on farmer convenience to ensure maximum participation and impact.\n\n\n Sony&amp;#x27;s daily schedule consists of field visits from 7 AM to 12:30 PM, followed by office work, including documentation, from 2 PM to 5 PM. \nThe specific tasks she handles include data collection for the farmer list, which spans one month (April and May). RIR data collection per farmer typically takes 40 to 60 minutes, while training sessions last between 45 minutes to 1 hour. Demonstrations usually take about 20 minutes, and the duration of home visits and follow-up meetings varies depending on the farmer&amp;#x27;s availability.\n\n Sony has facilitated a significant reduction in pesticide use, with farmers increasingly adopting organic fertilizers. This shift has resulted in an increase in crop yields, from the previous 7-8 quintals to 10-11 quintals. Through targeted outreach via SHG meetings and home visits, Sony has successfully increased female farmer participation. Additionally, she has ensured the effective implementation of PPE kits among the farming community.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sony encounters several challenges in her role as a Field Facilitator. The RIR data collection process is particularly time-consuming, often requiring an hour or more to document investment, expenditure, and profit for each farmer. She frequently deals with incorrect information provided by farmers, who may lack knowledge or initially be skeptical and mistrustful of her role. Some farmers are reluctant to share information directly, fearing they might lose access to government schemes, which necessitates Sony spending extra time on explanation and persuasion. However, she noted that after working with the farmers for a year, a level of trust has been established. The farmers are no longer as skeptical as they were initially, and they are now more willing to provide accurate information.\nFurthermore, her reliance on mobile phones for data entry proves to be an inefficient method at times as the device may happen to hang. She instead recommended the provision of special tablets for data collection Sony suggested reducing documentation work to allocate more time for fieldwork and training. She recommended the use of customized tablets to improve data management efficiency. \n\nTo enhance female participation, she proposed linking livelihood programs such as tailoring, packing systems, embroidery, and vegetable seeds packing. These initiatives aim to boost female participation, empowerment, and financial independence within the community. Additionally, she highlighted the need for more support in providing PPE kits, which many farmers currently find unaffordable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sony pointed out that the lack of irrigation facilities is a significant challenge mentioned by farmers, and she expressed a desire for Better Cotton to facilitate improvements in this area. She takes pride in her role, noting its positive impact on farmers&amp;#x27; knowledge and income. \n\nAdditionally, she believes that the current frequency of meetings with the PU Manager and Assistant PU Manager is sufficient, as they include regular follow-ups and discussions to address ongoing issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sony_FF_Budidapally INTL01 - Interview NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN PUM NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Walkthrough of the program / general overview Impact of the program Roles and responsibilities of the PU Manager (for Administration) Roles and responsibilities of the PU Manager (for Capacity Building) Time taken for each task\n Link to transcript NaN NaN NaN NaN Sindhu (INTL 01) Sindhu has been serving as a PUM for the past two years, overseeing a broad and impactful program. Her core objectives are to boost soil organic carbon, cut down pesticide toxicity, enhance farmer incomes, empower women, and advance regenerative agriculture. To achieve these goals, Sindhu and her team develop and implement field activities tailored to local needs.\n\nShe manages a team of 9 FFs, including an Assistant PUM, across 43 villages, reaching out to a total of 3,018 farmers. Since 2012, WWF has been a key partner in this project. The program operates within a structured hierarchy, starting with the farmers at the grassroots level, followed by Field Facilitators, PUMs, Navkranti FPCL, Project Coordinator (WWF), and finally BCI. Sindhu reports directly to Satish, the Project Coordinator, ensuring that the project&amp;#x27;s objectives are met and its impact is maximized. The impact of Sindhu’s work on the BCI objectives has been significant. The soil organic carbon levels have risen from 0.32 to 0.38, reflecting improved soil health. Additionally, there has been a notable increase in women&amp;#x27;s empowerment and the adoption of sustainable practices among farmers.\n\nThe success of the program is largely attributed to the dedication and efforts of Sindhu and her Field Facilitators. The highest impact comes from direct fieldwork, hands-on interactions with farmers, and the training sessions they conduct. However, documentation remains a challenging aspect, often seen as laborious despite its importance. Sindhu has frequently advocated for reducing the documentation burden, and BCI is currently developing an app to streamline data entry.\n\nSindhu finds fieldwork and training to be the most fulfilling parts of her job, and she believes farmers are eager to learn and implement new technologies. For instance, training on innovations like PB Knot and Cremigel has sparked interest among farmers, demonstrating their willingness to embrace new practices. If given the opportunity, Sindhu would prefer to allocate more time to these impactful field activities rather than the demanding task of documentation. Sindhu’s role encompasses a range of responsibilities across different categories:\n\nHR:Sindhu is involved in recruiting FFs, focusing on their experience in farming, communication skills, and motivation. After selecting candidates, she presents her recommendations to Satish sir.\n\nProject Management: Sindhu’s day begins early, around 6:30 or 7 AM. She starts by conducting training sessions for farmers, typically lasting an hour. If a farmer requests a farm visit, Sindhu accommodates that as well. By mid-morning, she returns home for lunch, and by early afternoon, she heads back to the office in Huzurabad.\n\nIn the office, Sindhu spends 30 minutes to an hour discussing with FFs, understanding their challenges, and learning from their experiences. She then focuses on documentation tasks, which include updating the farmers&amp;#x27; list, entering farming data, monitoring groundwater levels, and compiling soil testing results. The soil testing process, which involves collecting samples from each of the 43 villages, is done primarily during May and June. Sindhu also ensures that the minutes of training sessions taken by FFs are accurately cross-checked.\n\nSindhu manages intercropping and stem application demos, deciding on the allocation of these resources. Although she finds her work challenging at times, she feels capable of handling it effectively. The APUM assists with field visits, training, documentation verification, and monitoring, and Sindhu cross-checks this information once back in the office. She adjusts her village visits based on seasonal priorities, such as focusing on villages that have started land preparation.\n\nSindhu does not handle finance or external assessments directly. Training for FFs is tailored to the seasons, ensuring that they are well-prepared to teach farmers effectively. The FFs are equipped with various communication materials, including flexes, pamphlets, and door stickers, to aid in their training sessions.\n\nIn addition to farmer training, special sessions are held for a wider audience, including anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare professionals, pesticide sprayers, and school children. These trainings focus on important issues such as child labor, the dangers of hazardous chemicals, and the importance of education.\n\nEach year, Sindhu organizes six training sessions for each of her 97 LGs, and every village receives 3 to 4 special activities or trainings. As a PUM, Sindhu plays a crucial role in motivating farmers and stepping in when FFs need clarification or additional support.\n\nSindhu remains uncertain about whether there is a more efficient way to enhance the MEL processes, but she believes the current system is effective. She emphasizes the importance of data in assessing the impact of their training programs and ensuring they are achieving their intended outcomes. Sindhu&amp;#x27;s current time allocation reveals that 10% of her work is dedicated to administrative tasks, 60% to data management, and 30% to capacity strengthening (CS) activities. \n\nShe is keen to shift her focus more towards fieldwork and interactions with farmers, expressing a desire to reduce the time spent on documentation and data entry. Sindhu believes that the burden of data-related tasks, including cross-checking and managing duplicate information, could be alleviated with alternative solutions provided by BCI. This change would allow her to spend more time directly benefiting farmers and enhancing the program’s impact. Field notes_Sindhu_PUM NaN NaN NaN NaN Nikita (INTL 23) Nikita has been serving as a PUM for the past year. As per her the objective of the BC program are to identify cotton farmers, boost their yields, and support them throughout the growing cycle from sowing to harvesting, with an additional focus on empowering women, enhancing soil organic carbon, and reducing GHG emissions. Nikita’s approach is based on the principle that farmers are more likely to adapt to activities that are easily accessible to them, so she creates activity plans and conducts demonstrations and trainings tailored to the local context. Although farmers initially feel uncomfortable wearing PPE kits, Nikita educates them on their importance and the risks associated with not using them. Each LG is tasked with conducting six trainings annually. The highest impact of Nikita&amp;#x27;s role comes from providing training and demonstrations to farmers. She believes that for FFs to effectively teach farmers, they must be well-versed in every aspect of the BCI program. When FFs have a deep understanding, they can better explain the program&amp;#x27;s benefits and practices to the farmers.\n\nOn the other hand, Nikita finds that the impact of demonstrations is somewhat limited because they reach only a few farmers at a time. Many farmers have expressed frustration that they are often left out of these demos, leading to a perception of favoritism. Nikita feels that scaling up the demonstrations could make them more effective and beneficial to a larger number of farmers.\n\nDespite the challenges, Nikita notes that demos have been instrumental in fostering cross-learning. Farmers who participate share their experiences and benefits with others, sparking curiosity and encouraging broader adoption of practices. However, there are challenges in convincing farmers about the long-term benefits of reduced pesticide use, especially when initial yields drop, leading to concerns and hesitation.\n\nDocumentation work presents a significant challenge for Nikita, often detracting from her ability to focus on training. The complexity and volume of data management sometimes make it difficult for her to dedicate sufficient time to hands-on activities with farmers. Sindhu’s role encompasses a range of responsibilities across different categories:\n\nIn terms of HR, Nikita conducts preliminary screenings of candidates before forwarding them to Sindhu or Satish. Although she doesn&amp;#x27;t handle finance or accounts, she plays a key role in project management by developing activity plans, ensuring deadlines are met, and coordinating self-assessment and external evaluations for FFs. She manages documentation, reviews progress bi-monthly, and monitors daily field updates.\n\nNikita employs a structured approach to systems and processes. She prepares a yearly activity plan, maintains daily to-do lists, and sets deadlines for long-term goals. She holds internal FF review meetings twice a month to discuss a 15-day work plan. For tools, she uses diaries, boards for FFs, and computers for data management.\n\nHer personal passion for animals and nature, rooted in her master’s in Zoology and her work with WWF on a Biodiversity Restoration project, has driven her commitment to organic practices and environmental sustainability. She believes that aligning with BCI principles helps create a favorable environment for both farmers and wildlife. Nikita manages the training process across 55 villages, focusing on the six BCI principles, with a total of 330 training sessions (55 villages x 6 principles). In addition to these, she integrates discussions on 30 regenerative agriculture (RA) practices into the same training sessions, advising farmers on various activities within the same framework. To date, she has conducted 24 trainings (12 sessions x 2).\n\nEach FF visits the same village twice a month, ensuring regular interaction with farmers. Despite occasional resistance from some farmers towards Nikita, most are enthusiastic about receiving input and guidance.\n\n Regarding her workload, Nikita allocates her time as follows: 5% on administrative tasks (with Sindhu assisting significantly in this area), 60% on data management, and 35% on capacity strengthening (CS). While BCI had promised a reduction in documentation requirements, there is still a need to maintain certain records to demonstrate adherence to program objectives. Nikita believes that spending more time in the field, rather than on data entry, would be more beneficial for understanding and addressing the challenges faced by farmers.

WWF PC - Satish is a consultant for WWF India , POC for BCI \n- Administrative + technical support for Karimnagar cluster, since 2012 (for other clusters - Satish assists in technical work)\nResponsibilities: Divided in Admin &amp;amp; Technical \nBroad responsibilities: \nData collection for project proposals \nSubmission of Annual data to BCI \nCB of staff, planning for farmer training - Satish mainly responsible for staff trainings (TOT) \nplanning , cross checking of documentations, training, action plans, corrective action plans, project review, analysis of results, - his broad responsibilities \nUnder technical -\nDeveloping materials (like BCI principles recently changed - Satish translated in local language) includes material for training(PUMs and FFs), \nplan for conducting trainings - PUM &amp;amp; FFs, \nAlso involved in BCI licensing assessments (whatever support required from WWF), \nCAP \nUnder Admin \nMonitoring - Satish visits the fields at least 2 to 3 times a week. He talks to them, understands their issue, takes inputs from them, etc. During internal review he discusses this with PUM (once a month) PUMs also conduct stock taking meeting with FFs one in 15 days \n(for each and every document there is a detailed monitoring protocol. For eg. FFB - Field staff will monitor 10%, PUM 3%, APM 5%, Satish 3% at project level not unit level) \nMonitoring, reviewing, staff recruitment \n(every village (earlier it was LG) has one demo farmer for whom we give green grams, biofertilizers, etc. and other activities) \n Farmers list (annual): Giving training to PUM - how to fill, etc. &amp;amp; to Cross checking by Satish before sending to BCI\nTools used: They internally have made easy excels (not prescribed by BCI) key points required by BCI are shared with them, rest retained with us. \nAttendance list: NA (only when he goes on field he sees it - this comes mainly under the purview of FF / PUM) \nTraining &amp;amp; CS activities: PUM and PU staff training,(farmer training - FFs / PUM responsible) \nAdoption , RIR - Same as CS activities\nFFB - No work but checks during field visits \n\n CS for farmers: Satish gives training to PUMs / Field staff, not directly to farmers. During CS activities, FF may not know the answer to every question farmers ask - they call Satish and ask him / whatsapp him. Admin: 20%, \nData - \nFarmers list, Attendance, Training &amp;amp; CS, Adoption, RIR, FFB : 25-30%\nTrainings &amp;amp; CS: 25-30%\nDemos and Community level activities: 5-10% \n\nMax time in data and CS \n\nAs per Satish, CB / CS and monitoring of fields of work are more helpful to farmers instead of data. \n\nImportance of Data : \n- Satish has discussed previously with BCI that such level of data collection is not required, data load is decreased alot now compared to 2012 -13 \n- Reasons for doing FFB activity: BCI says for Farmer learning and RIR data \n- After many years of back &amp;amp; forth: only 15% farmers in a PU are mandated to maintain FFB, rest voluntary. \n- No FFB was to be included in PURE - since farmers are interested in maintaining their own diary. Maintaining FFB also leads to increase in no. of training - how to fill, what units to fill, etc. \n- Satish said he would like to spend more time on training than being bogged down with data work \n- Satish had suggested that we (WWF) can make our own data templates to collect data - simple data - farmer name, village name, gender, mode of irrigation, contact - that&amp;#x27;s it. \n- Suggestion: Reduce data burden on FF / PUM. \n - Because of WWF - BC thought of implementing a project at global level (H&amp;amp;M) \n- Similarly for PURE, they are piloting with us (India) - this shows the trust they have in WWF. \n- None of the INTLs have lost any licensing - this speaks for our work. - We speak directly with BCI \n Before data comes to Satish, it is checked 2 times (PUM and APUM) - so if they do a good job in checking my challenges are reduced automatically, but no other challenges as such.

She also motivates them to adopt sustainable practices. \n- RIR - She is responsible for cross checking data in FFB. Sometimes farmers inflate costs and they are quickly able to understand because they have data from other farmers. \nFFB - She assists farmers in filling the FFB, then signs and takes a picture of it for record.\n - Vanitas day starts at 7:30 AM &amp;gt;&amp;gt; goes to the field then goes to office after lunch - enters data from morning sessions \n- She is assisted by the APU manager and PU manager at times \n- Training timings are discussed and finalized on whatsapp groups, at times\n- Daily activities - calling farmers to arrange for training, conducting the trainings, data &amp;amp; admin work, Female farmer trainings \n- During training she makes use of Flex and believes that it is very useful for farmers to understand concepts easily. Farmers also find it easier to grasp concepts when shown through pictures on a flex.\n- Topics covered: Water management, biodiversity, soil health management, storage of cotton. \n- Nearly 20 to 30 farmers participate in every training session. \n- Farmers who miss the training, FF goes and meets them on field and educates them on the topics that he or she missed. \n- After meetings, farmers who have attended the training are made to sign in the LG book. \n- She maintains a diary for noting all points related to the trainings \n- Soil testing is also conducted - after the results she goes and talks to them and advises them, if need be. \n- In a month she conducts 3 to 4 meetings \n- Till date, two rallies have been held on PPE Kits and child labour. - Administration: ½ hr - diary entry, 2-3 hours office data work \n- During season there is data entry work every day which takes 2 to 3 hours daily \n- Off season it is only 1-2 hours \n- Overall : 50-70% time goes in admin work on a monthly basis - Farmers list - 10 to 15 mins daily \n- Attendance list - 15 to 10 mins daily \n- Capacity strengthening - 3 hours daily \n- Adoption - ½ - 1 hour daily \n- RIR - 1 hour \n- FFB - ½ hour \n- Demo - weekly once -2 hours \n- Overall - Admin: 30%, Data work: 40%, CS: 20 to 30% \n\n- She wants to spend more time on training because excessive data work gives her shoulder and eye pain and she finds interacting with farmers more fruitful. \n- Given an option she would reduce her data entry work\n - Motivation for being FF - Vanita used to previously deal with farmers and also work in the children&amp;#x27;s rights domain. She enjoys farming and believes that women farmers have more ideas than men. She said that BC encourages farmers to share their ideas and keep them inspired. Additionally, she believes that the highest profits are reaped from farming the organic way. \n- Highest impact work: Training, phone follows ups, one to one interactions with farmers and field workers.\n- Vanitha believes that data is very important as it tells us a story and based on that they conduct the trainings.\n\n Incorrect data and delays in data sharing involving repeated follow up which becomes time consuming. - As per Vanita, doing organic farming yields higher quality cotton \n- As per Vanita, her responsibilities which will benefit the farmers more is - an increase in her field time and scheduling meetings as per farmers availability (in the afternoon instead of morning) \n- Vanita feels that there is scope for improvement in efficiency of admin work and also she feels she can increase her knowledge in order to provide more information to the farmers.\n When asked about her overall experience, she said she has gathered more information to communicate with farmers in BCI, performed soil testing, and visited farmers&amp;#x27; gatherings in village GPs. Field notes_FF_Vanita NaN NaN FF2 - Rakesh (INTL 02) - Rakesh has six villages and 445 farmers under him \n- He has been FF since 2 years \n- When asked about the tools for management, used by FF, Rakesh mentioned that he uses his mobile phone for almost every work. He has to click photos and share with PUM on a daily basis - this leads to a lot of data and ultimately hangs up his phone. He said it would be nice if BC would provide them with tabs.\n Attendance: Minutes of every meeting / training is made by the FF. If he cannot make it in the meeting then he goes to his office and prepares the detailed version. Sign of every farmer is also taken in the LG attendance book after every meeting. \nFFB: Rakesh helping illiterate farmers in filling FFB. He said that literate farmers are able to fill the data correctly and the illiterate farmers usually make mistakes so we tell them to carry it during the meeting. \nAdoption data: - Rakesh said that he has the printout of the adoption data table and as per every farmer - the practices he follows, he ticks the relevant practices. \n- This data is then sent to the PUM - who further checks it and then enters in the computer. \nRIR: FF has nothing to do with RIR - only from FFB transfer to excel - this excel is an internal doc made by WWF (not as complex as RIR) - He meets with minimum 2 LGs per day \n- As per season training topics are taken up , one meeting lasts for one hour. \n- 1 LG - 1 adoption sheet \n- 15 days - training on 1 topic across all villages under him- FFs discuss with PUMs on topics to teach farmers. The meetings are conducted by Rakesh alone ( no supporting staff) - only some meetings PUM attend like on child labour, only-women meetings - once a month. APUM checks once in 15 days if we are having meetings or not. \n- General topics covered: soil health, biodiversity, how to increase fertility of land, reduction in water pollution, etc.\n- Rakesh said that they provide green gram and red gram seeds to RA (regenerative agriculture) Demo farmers, not all the farmers. By helping reduce their investment costs, we&amp;#x27;ve gained their trust, and they attend our meetings regularly. As a voluntary organization, we share valuable information, which strengthens their trust in us. During meetings, we explain the use of combination medicines, pheromone traps, and sticky traps, which encourages their continued participation.\n- When asked on how he reaches out to farmers who do not attend meetings - he said he does home visits, follows up with them on phone and gives them a download of all the topics discussed and urges them to attend the following meetings. \n- Rakesh mentioned that he sometimes goes to SHG meetings where he finds all the women - he educates them on kitchen gardening, tailoring, knowledge on PPE kits, etc. \n- Once the cotton is plucked, Rakesh provides suggestions on storage - for eg. to keep it away from water, open storage better, etc. - His day starts at 6:30 AM, farmers are already informed about the meeting the previous evening. He gives training for one hour followed by field visits / observations: 30 mins \n- Office work : 3 hours \n- In may &amp;amp; dec - well monitoring - 3 villages \n- Overall: Admin: 20% , Data: 30%, Capacity strengthening: 50% \n- Rakesh mentioned that he doesn&amp;#x27;t like (feels it is a time waste) to transfer well monitoring data from field to g sheets - it is not required \n- He said that instead this time could be used to train farmers who are not growing cotton but other crops like maize, paddy, etc. \n- When asked about the time taken for Farmers list - Rakesh said it takes 15 to 20 minutes from each farmer and it takes 2 to 3 days to collect info from one village and for all villages under him 10 to 15 days (annually - since farmer list is updated every year) \n\nWhen asked about what he would like to work more upon and what work he would like to reduce - \n- He said he would like it if data documentation work was reduced. Few farmers do not update / enter the wrong data -in their FFB, as a result of which data for RIR gets affected. When asked about how he knows that the correct info is filled in FFB he mentioned that the literate farmers fill data properly and he helps the illiterate ones. \n- Rakesh is interested in conducting training \n- He said that data is important as it supports farmers indirectly and also helps in monitoring their work.\n - Previously, farmers were investing Rs. 18,000 per acre, but now their expenditure has reduced to less than Rs. 15,000. \n- Before participating in the BCI project, farmers were heavily using DAP based on their own knowledge, but it wasn&amp;#x27;t yielding the expected results. \n- Rakesh also mentioned that they are providing vegetable seeds and connecting farmers with tailoring units, while also supplying more seeds for kitchen gardens.\n- Through their Sustainable Land Management efforts, they have distributed plants to farmers in partnership with WWF. Additionally, they also provide border crops, such as coconut trees, to protect farm boundaries and help retain soil moisture.\n\nMotivation of Rakesh: \n- “I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” \n- Rakesh feels immense pride that he has been able to reduce fertilizer usage which led to increase by 10 to 12 quintals per acre \n- When asked what he feels has been the impact of his work - &amp;quot;I never recommend using pesticides; instead, I advocate for organic fertilizers like neem oil and homemade preparations. We use Agni Asram, neem, and Jeevamrutham, all of which are prepared on agricultural land. The soil quality has remained stable. We’ve organized rallies in villages to discourage the use of red-colored pesticides. During meetings, we conducted an intercropping demonstration using green grams, which not only increased soil carbon but also provided farmers with an additional income. We are also developing vermicompost.&amp;quot;\n- Rakesh has till date conducted over 50 trainings for farmers - he conducts meetings with other stakeholders too like workers, schools, ANMs, etc.) \n- Overall, Rakesh said he feels he has created a 70% impact and there is still scope for improvement. \n- As per Rakesh, there is a clear difference between BCI &amp;amp; non-BCI cotton - quality, color and fibre, etc. \n- As per Rakesh, the highest impact of his work has been by educating farmers on bio pest, cow urine and cow dung NaN - To have meetings at night (6:30 to 8:30 PM) - since farmers are free at that time \n - Rakesh feels that the cultivation of Better Cotton is on the rise. He particularly appreciates the use of bio-pesticides and the preparation of neem oil by farmers. - A mixture of 5 kg cow dung, 5 liters of cow urine, 5 kg of jaggery, and soil is also used, and he finds this method effective. \n- Farmers are also preparing and using Trichoderma, which he highly values. Stem application is another method he favors; out of 30 farmers, 20 are using it. - This technique effectively eradicates sucking insects. What he loves most about stem application is that it prevents soil and environmental pollution, unlike spraying, which can cause harm. By applying directly to the plant stem, we ensure no damage to the soil or the environment.\n\n(about stem application usage: Sixty percent of farmers are using stem application. Just 250 ml is sufficient for two acres. While spraying costs around Rs. 1,000, stem application costs only Rs. 200. It also saves time, taking just one hour compared to two for spraying. Overall, the investment is significantly lower. This method has been implemented since two years)\n FF - Rakesh NaN NaN FF 3 - Ramesh (INTL23) Monthly Planning and Execution: Prepare and implement the Monthly Action Plan. This includes planning village visits, scheduling meetings, and conducting awareness programs based on seasonal requirements.\nCoordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages. Coordinate with Lead Farmers, community heads, and stakeholders to gather and disseminate necessary information.\nReporting: Report to the Field Manager and PU Manager, providing updates on any deviations in the plan and ensuring all activities align with the program’s objectives.\nDocumentation: Maintain and verify Farmer Field Books (FFBs), write in diaries, and submit meeting minutes and signatures to the Field Manager. Data Collection and Validation: Collect data from Lead Farmers, validate farmer lists through physical visits and phone calls, and update records accordingly. Ensure the accuracy of data by cross-checking information.\nMonitoring Farmer Practices: Monitor farmers&amp;#x27; adherence to guidelines, especially regarding the use of organic fertilizers and pesticides, and follow up to ensure continued compliance.\nResult Indicator Reporting (RIR): Track and report on key performance indicators related to farmer practices and crop outcomes.\n\n\nData Validation: Cross-check data over the phone and through physical visits. Ensure data is updated and accurate.\nMonitoring: Regularly monitor farmer practices, particularly the use of organic fertilizers and adherence to guidelines.\n Training and Awareness Programs: Conduct training sessions and awareness meetings with farmers on topics such as crop management, pesticide use, and environmental protection. Use Farmer Field Books (FFBs) to educate farmers on record-keeping.\nMaterial Distribution and Demonstrations: Distribute educational materials like flexes, demonstrate techniques such as using sticky traps, and share videos via WhatsApp groups to reinforce training.\nPromoting Sustainable Practices: Encourage the adoption of sustainable farming practices, including the use of Navadhanyalu (nine types of seeds) and reducing the use of chemical pesticides.\n Training Sessions: 30-40 minutes per session.\nField Visits: Daily from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM, with specific timings for meetings and fieldwork.\nPost Noon - Office works mostly Environmental Benefits: Reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, increased use of organic fertilizers, and improved environmental protection.\nFarmer Benefits: Increased yield, reduced investment, and improved education for farmer children due to higher profits.\nAdoption of Practices: High adoption rate of guidelines among farmers, 80% following the recommended practices. Data Management: Ensuring accurate data collection and validation can be time-consuming \nFarmer Engagement: Not all farmers consistently maintain their Farmer Field Books - so have to sit and write diaries with them Enhancing Female Participation: Plan and conduct more separate meetings for women farmers to increase their participation, especially considering the constraints they face such as domestic responsibilities and long distances.\nUse of Technology: Integrate more audiovisual tools in training sessions to enhance understanding and retention among farmers. Sustained Engagement Needed: Continued follow-up and engagement are crucial to prevent farmers from reverting to less sustainable practices if the project ends.\nCapacity Building for Field Facilitators was asked by Ramesh Field Facilitator - Ramesh NaN NaN FF 4 - Sony (INTL01) Coordination and Communication: Communicate with farmers via calls, WhatsApp messages, and voice messages.

APUM) and 43 villages under Sindhu, 3018 farmers \n- From 2012 WWF has been part of this project. \n- Governing structure (from bottom level) - Farmer, FF, PUM, Navkranti FPCL, Project coordinator (WWF), BCI\n- Sindhu reports to project coordinator - Satish \n - Impact of work on BCI objectives: \nInitially the soil organic carbon - 0.32 now it is 0.38 \nWomen empowerment has increased \nIncrease in adoption practices \n- Factors contributing to the success of the program: Our hard work &amp;amp; FFs contribute to the success of the program \n- Highest impact: Working on the field, field interactions and conducting trainings \n- Lowest impact: Documentation is difficult. But data is important. \n- Aspects of work which are complex: Doing the compilation is a task and laborious work. She has told BCI many times to reduce the documentation. (BCI in process of developing an app for direct data entry)\n- Time allocation of which of your responsibilities could be changed: Sindhu likes going on the field and conducting training - she said that farmers are also keen to learn and know more about tech (PB Knot, Cremigel, etc.) if we train them on this they are interested in its implementation. \n Role of Sindhu under various categories of work: \n\nHR: Recruitment of FF (based on experience &amp;amp; knowledge in farming, communication skills, motivation) \nAfter selecting she shares with Satish sir. \nFinance, Accounts: NA \nProject management: \n- Her day starts at 6:30 - 7 AM. FFs arrange for the farmers, then Sindhu goes and gives them training for an hour. If any farmer wants Sindhu to visit farm then she goes there too. \n- By 11:30-12 - home and lunch \n- By 1:30 - 2 - back to office (Huzurabad) - half an hour to one hour she talks to FF - understands their challenges, learnings, etc. \n- Then she does documentation work - Presently working on farmers list (updating last year list and entering farming data), well monitoring data (groundwater levels data), compiling of soil testing (this not everyday, from every 43 village 4 or 5 samples from each - cross checking of data) Minutes of training taken by FF - Sindhu cross checks that \n- Soil testing completed in may-june. Distributed soil health card to farmers and now compiling data ..\n- Intercropping demo, stem application demo - to whom to give, etc. \n- Any work she finds complex - nothing as such, she is managing everything \n- Role of APUM - field visits with one FF, training, documentation verification &amp;amp; monitoring - after coming to office we cross check with FF, etc. \n- Based on season, she decides which villages to go to - for eg. if any village has started with land prep then will prioritize that over another which has not yet.\nCoordinator and facilitation of external assessment : NA Processes under MEL: \n- Cross checking: For each document there is a % which she cross checks. From each FF, 10 to 20% data is considered. So say if an FF has 4 villages under her - from each village 10% is considered and that sample is called and cross checked. \n- Each list / document is cross checked 10-20% (if the population is high) and 5 to 10% (if population is low) \n- This % was fixed internally by WWF. \n- APUM cross checks 40 to 50% \n- Project coordinator checks 3 to 5% \n- As per her, this process is reliable. If she finds any issues - she again tells the FF to cross check - so the process is very reliable. \n- Data is collected in google sheets, hard copies. Every document has a hardcopy - little difficult to manage but major data on google sheets. \n\nManagement strategies: \n- We have a monitoring sheet with us when we go on field, she notes down in the sheet. \n- She also carries her diary and makes notes of suggestions, etc. We also come back and discuss with KVKs. \n- There is a whatsapp group of FFs + KVKs - so if FFs are unable to answer anything, they step in and answer. \n- Whatsapp group of only FFs + Sindhu \n- Whatsapp group with farmers \n- Village wise whatsapp group also \n- They put weather forecast info also \n- These groups also help farmers who have missed training to come to speed \n\nFactors that driver her: Her parents were farmers, she is interested in this and has a degree as well in soil science. \n\nNumber of lists: Soil health (soil organic carbon, etc. is analyzed, we cross check if decreased or increased) &amp;gt; Early season estimates (farmers list) &amp;gt; well monitoring&amp;gt; Demos are planned &amp;gt; PRA data &amp;gt; Activity / monitoring plan &amp;gt; adoption plan &amp;gt; FFBs &amp;gt; RIR (post harvest estimates) \nWhat is the Farmers list approach? LGs, farmer codes for individual farmers, co farmers, irrigation data etc. (for responsibilities wrt each list see detailed transcript)\n\nHow is the sample collected? \n- APUM - 40 to 50% of type of data, PUM - 10%, Satish sir - 3 to 5% \n- Demos are held based on seasons - for eg. sowing then spraying and Rallies (staff and villagers walking together with placards) are held in sept - august - for eg. not to use highly chemical pesticides, use PPE Kits, etc. - this way even Non - BC farmers get educated. \n\nTime spent on MEL work - Season wise lists are prepared - so her work also varies accordingly. Currently time for farmers list so her 1-2 weeks goes in that. After that some other data set. - We train the FFs depending on season &amp;gt;&amp;gt; that they teach farmers \n- Communication material carried by FFs - flexes, pamphlets, door stickers. \n- We give special trainings also - to anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare workers, pesticide sprayers, school children - we tell them about Child Labour, to be away from hazardous chemicals, focus on education, etc.\n- Every year 6 farmer trainings for each LG - she has 97 LGs \n- Each village 3-4 special activities / trainings \n- PUM role - Motivating farmers, if FFs cannot clarify anything then PUM comes in. \n- She is not sure if there is any efficient way to improve the MEL processes. She feels the current way is good. \n- Data is important - it helps understand if our training is working or not. \n Overall: Admin: 10%, Data: 60%, CS: 30%\n\nSindhu wants to spend more time with farmers and less on documentation. If BCI gives any alternative then she would be happy. She would like to replace her data admin work with field work. Data entry burden must be reduced - cross checking, duplication data, etc. no challenges faced in execution NaN - Any given farmer - may be growing multiple crops on his 5-6 acres of land. In such cases we train on other crops also - if farmers have queries on other crops we answer. \n- In paddy farming, work is much less compared to cotton - once transplantation is done for paddy - farmers just go to farm daily switches on pump machines and that&amp;#x27;s it. But for cotton, everyday farmers have to go and some or other work is there. Water availability is high here so many are opting for paddy. \n Field notes_Sindhu_PUM NaN Nikita (INTL 23) - She has been the PUM since one year \nObjectives as per Nikita: to identify cotton farmers and increase their yields, support farmers from sowing to harvesting, to empower women, increase soil organic carbon and decrease GHG emissions. \n- 50% chance that farmers will adapt to activities easily accessible to them. Accordingly we make activity plan and conduct demos, training, etc. all this is based on local context, so that it is easy for them to adopt to it. \n- Farmers feel a bit uncomfortable in PPE Kit - we make them aware of its importance and disadvantages of not wearing it \n- Annually six trainings have to be conducted every LG \n Highest impact: Giving training &amp;amp; demos to farmers is very crucial - it is very important for FFs to be knowledgeable. Every aspect of BCI should be known by FF only then he will be able to explain to farmers. \nLow impact: Demos are only for few farmers (as impossible to give all farmers the inputs) - many farmers said that we come for training but you select only few. Nikita feels that if demos are done on a larger scale it will be more beneficial. \nNikita said that the Demos have been crucial - there are cross learnings since farmers tell other farmers the benefits they have gained. Because of this even other farmers become curious to practice the same. At times it is difficult for them to understand that pesticides are harmful because the yields initially drop. So farmers are worried about this - other than this they follow most of the things. \nComplex work: documentation work is complex - sometimes we are not able to concentrate on training because of excessive data work. HR:Preliminary screening of candidates - and then send to Sindhu or Satish \nFinance, Accounts: NA \nProject Management: - To build activity plan according to which trainings are conducted as per pre determined timeline, Deadlines are fixed - cross checked, etc.\nCoordinator and facilitation of external assessment: Self assessment, CB to FFs \nOthers: Documentation work, Monthly twice review meetings, Daily field updates - we check FF phones if they have invited farmers and if few farmers have not attended why they have not attended. \n\nSystems &amp;amp; processes: Yearly there is an activity plan - Nikita makes a to do plan every day and mentions deadlines for long term plans. In the internal FF review meetings (which is held twice monthly) she discusses a 15 day work plan with them. \n\nTools used : Diaries, for FFs she uses board and for data computer \n\nFactors that drive you to execute your duties: Personal interest in animals and nature. After her masters in Zoology, she was interning with WWF under Biodiversity Restoration project. She believes that if the environment is friendly then only the animals will survive. That is why she propagates using organic fertilizers. She believes that BCI principles are very close to her ideologies. What data she handles? \n- Annually, we have to make a time bound plan, for which we have to know the key issues - collected by FF. This year we have an activity plan then a monitoring plan. \n- Soil sample testing - after that data compiled by FF, she puts it in the computer in prescribed BC format and then shares it to the project coordinator. \n- Action plan for FFs every month activities \n- Locally used pesticides list \n- Disadvantage list: we identify physically handicapped people and provide them livelihood - we try to collaborate with govt. Schemes \n- Degraded lands identification - degraded lands identified and then restoration plan \n- FFB updation (routine) \n- Adoption \n- RIR \n\nHow does she manage the data ?\n- Every data is seasonal and accordingly we share hard copies with FF \n- Tools used for handling data: Hardcopies, internal WWF excel templates which FF fill and give me, google sheets are also used. \n- FF collect data from farmers and then give to PUM &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PUM checks / calls or one to one contact with farmers and rectify any issue &amp;gt;&amp;gt; - APUM also checks the data &amp;gt; PUM &amp;gt; Project coordinator \n\nAbout farmers list\n- Annual updation \n- FF goes to the village and identifies cotton growing farmers and enrolls them. FF collects the data - if anyone is not growing cotton anymore then the same is mentioned. We filter him out and add new farmer. \n\nTypes of data collected: See the detailed transcript \n\nSample selection - randomly \n\nSteps taken to ensure quality and integrity of data collected: \n- She always cross checks. In the farmer list , we randomly select 10 farmers and call them up to cross check info. If there is a mismatch, then Nikita goes to FF and tells them to cross check the entire data from her end. \n- 10% of sample size is chosen by me and if there is a mistake the full list is to be checked by FF. \n- APUM cross checks data and sometimes APUM also fills in data. \n- Note: PUM checks 10% from every village data - so FF may have 5 villages under him or her - 10% of every 5 villages (50). APUM checks 20 to 30% .. and project coordinator 3 to 5% - Trainings are conducted across 55 villages on the 6 BCI principles (55* 6). We also talk about RA practices (30 practices) - there is no separate training for this. In the same training we suggest farmers to do certain activities. \n- Trainings conducted till date: 12 *2 = 24 trainings \n- Frequency of the training: 1 FF will reach the same village twice a month. \n- At times, farmers are not interested in listening to me - most farmers are eager to get some input \n Overall: Admin: 5% (Since sindhu helps her in most admin work), Data: 60%, CS: 35%\n\nBCI had told us documentation will reduce, even though it has reduced we have to maintain some docs to show proof of farmers adhering to program objectives. It will be better if we get more time on field than data entry work, and will be better in understanding issues faced by farmers. \n\nDo you think the MEL systems are efficient? \n10% is currently done, for the errors to lessen it would be better if we considered 20 to 30% . Due to heavy documentation work it becomes difficult. \n Challenges in execution / managing the PU position: \n- Deadlines are strict and sometimes we dont get data on time from farmers. For FF also it is difficult to collect data from farmers \nThe above issue does not have effect on final project outcomes \n- Before BC project deadline, Satish sir has a deadline\n Collection of data should be done in another way so that it is easier to fill in data. No issue in CS since Satish sir always there with us.

WWF PC - Satish is a consultant for WWF India , POC for BCI \n- Administrative + technical support for Karimnagar cluster, since 2012 (for other clusters - Satish assists in technical work)\nResponsibilities: Divided in Admin &amp;amp; Technical \nBroad responsibilities: \nData collection for project proposals \nSubmission of Annual data to BCI \nCB of staff, planning for farmer training - Satish mainly responsible for staff trainings (TOT) \nplanning , cross checking of documentations, training, action plans, corrective action plans, project review, analysis of results, - his broad responsibilities \nUnder technical -\nDeveloping materials (like BCI principles recently changed - Satish translated in local language) includes material for training(PUMs and FFs), \nplan for conducting trainings - PUM &amp;amp; FFs, \nAlso involved in BCI licensing assessments (whatever support required from WWF), \nCAP \nUnder Admin \nMonitoring - Satish visits the fields at least 2 to 3 times a week. He talks to them, understands their issue, takes inputs from them, etc. During internal review he discusses this with PUM (once a month) PUMs also conduct stock taking meeting with FFs one in 15 days \n(for each and every document there is a detailed monitoring protocol. For eg. FFB - Field staff will monitor 10%, PUM 3%, APM 5%, Satish 3% at project level not unit level) \nMonitoring, reviewing, staff recruitment \n(every village (earlier it was LG) has one demo farmer for whom we give green grams, biofertilizers, etc. and other activities) \n Farmers list (annual): Giving training to PUM - how to fill, etc. &amp;amp; to Cross checking by Satish before sending to BCI\nTools used: They internally have made easy excels (not prescribed by BCI) key points required by BCI are shared with them, rest retained with us. \nAttendance list: NA (only when he goes on field he sees it - this comes mainly under the purview of FF / PUM) \nTraining &amp;amp; CS activities: PUM and PU staff training,(farmer training - FFs / PUM responsible) \nAdoption , RIR - Same as CS activities\nFFB - No work but checks during field visits \n\n CS for farmers: Satish gives training to PUMs / Field staff, not directly to farmers. During CS activities, FF may not know the answer to every question farmers ask - they call Satish and ask him / whatsapp him. Admin: 20%, \nData - \nFarmers list, Attendance, Training &amp;amp; CS, Adoption, RIR, FFB : 25-30%\nTrainings &amp;amp; CS: 25-30%\nDemos and Community level activities: 5-10% \n\nMax time in data and CS \n\nAs per Satish, CB / CS and monitoring of fields of work are more helpful to farmers instead of data. \n\nImportance of Data : \n- Satish has discussed previously with BCI that such level of data collection is not required, data load is decreased alot now compared to 2012 -13 \n- Reasons for doing FFB activity: BCI says for Farmer learning and RIR data \n- After many years of back &amp;amp; forth: only 15% farmers in a PU are mandated to maintain FFB, rest voluntary. \n- No FFB was to be included in PURE - since farmers are interested in maintaining their own diary. Maintaining FFB also leads to increase in no. of training - how to fill, what units to fill, etc. \n- Satish said he would like to spend more time on training than being bogged down with data work \n- Satish had suggested that we (WWF) can make our own data templates to collect data - simple data - farmer name, village name, gender, mode of irrigation, contact - that&amp;#x27;s it. \n- Suggestion: Reduce data burden on FF / PUM. \n - Because of WWF - BC thought of implementing a project at global level (H&amp;amp;M) \n- Similarly for PURE, they are piloting with us (India) - this shows the trust they have in WWF. \n- None of the INTLs have lost any licensing - this speaks for our work. - We speak directly with BCI \n Before data comes to Satish, it is checked 2 times (PUM and APUM) - so if they do a good job in checking my challenges are reduced automatically, but no other challenges as such. - The Appointment of MEL, CB manager has helped me put more time in other priority work where I am needed more. \n- More focus to be on capacity building. \n- Lot of docs in BCI, soft copies (1 TB finished) - Separate MEL manager will help us do effective analysis \n- Data including work burden of PUM instead of CS, in the self assessment report (every PU has this) for so many years, i have always given feedback that data needs to reduce inorder for PUMs to concentrate on field work \n\nOpinion on PUM / FF work allocation \nDepends from person to person \n75-80% of PUMs are doing well, 20-25% need to focus more on the project\n About Licensing: \n\n- Rigorous audits done by BC for licensing of PU - 4 days of audit \n- They choose the sample - not WWF. \n- Management - checking of docs, what are the planned activities, activity wise success indicators, etc. \n- Interview with PUM - They talk to PUM - as per BCI PUM, a very important / effective POC. - - They feel, if PUM is effective then the farmers will reap the benefits. Even the project - coordinator is not allowed to speak much during these meetings with PUM. \n- Field level - they will select some LGs (BC informs only 24 hours before about the sample to avoid any manipulation) -Farmer interviews are done- they ask BCI principles being followed are not - they check farmers knowledge and then the adoption - two main factors. \n- Other stakeholders - Workers - BC also interacts with field workers\n- Verifiers will cross check with fertilizer shops and cross check if they are selling organic fertilizers mentioned by farmers in the vicinity,\n- They also check with schools asking them if there is any child labor, etc. \n- Closing day - major findings are discussed \n- They prepare a report and submit it to BC India and they decide if the license will be continued or not. Types of licenses - Compliance with observation (means farmers may have knowledge but adoption is less - so they will give chance to see if there is any growth happening) \n- 64 Indicators under BCI - non-compliance with any one of the indicators - license is lost. \n- Licensing done once in three years. INTL 23 is pending for licensing this year. INTL 01 and 02 got licenses in the last 2 years.\n About ginners \n\n- Supply chain very big challenge in BCI \n- BC program farmers do not necessarily go to BC licensed Ginner \n- BC program farmers wanted more money per quintal - premium \n- Ultimate benefit of this project is to the environment \n- Biggest cotton market - Jammikunta - Rs. 100-150 price higher compared to other markets. Reason: There are a lot of ginning mills in Jammikunta, so prices are competitive. \n- There is a BCI portal for registered ginners and spinners. \n- Ginners are not getting a lot of benefit and hence are not keen on continuing with the license. \n Field notes_Satish_PC WWF --- Sheet: KPI2 --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 15% increase in women participation in BC activities (benefiting from the work)\n Unnamed: 3 Unnamed: 4 Unnamed: 5 Unnamed: 6 Unnamed: 7 Unnamed: 8 Unnamed: 9 Unnamed: 10 NaN NaN Stakeholders for KPI 2 : BC Program farmers (F), Non program farmers (F) &amp;amp; Co farmers (F) NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN BC Program Farmers (female) NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Gender Analysis Matrix Experience and expectations as a Woman program farmer Attendance in trainings and other capacity strengthening activities Effectiveness of trainings and other capacity strengthening activities Effectiveness of other capacity strengthening initiatives (demonstrations/ exposure visits/ activities etc) Change in knowledge, attitude and practices (capacity) related to cotton farming Change in agency/empowerment\n Role of men &amp;amp; women on farms and farmers education aspirations for their children Other topics covered Link to transcript Bheempally (INTL 02) NaN - Part of program since: The women have been associated with BC since two years but have been growing cotton since 20 years \n- Other crops grown: Besides cotton, they also grow Maize from December to March - they get paid Rs. 2,300 per quintal (one acre produces close to 25 to 30 quintals) \n- Engagement with BC program: There are 40 BC farmers in the village - out of which 11 to 12 are women \n- Farmers are not using pesticides - they use pheromone traps and neem oil &amp;amp; follow calendar spraying. \n- They have stopped using cocktails from past 3 to 4 years. \n- Soil testing is done free of cost – they give a report after 15 days, helps them to plan which crops to grow. \n- They wear PPE kits diligently - masks, they make use of old dresses as aprons (costs Rs. 500 per PPE Kit, big farmers who can afford buy it – it lasts for one year. Other farmers make use of old shirts, sarees, scarves and use it as PPE kit) \n- Farmers also use vermi compost \n- Support by family \n- The women said that the husbands and full family is very supportive of them being in farming and that they let them take farm decisions. \n- Husbands do not object when women go for meetings. Earlier they used to not allow, but now they allow - even husbands have become sensitive to the needs of women. \n- Whatever women learn in the training, they go and share / discuss with husbands. \n- Reason for joining BC program \n- To improve crops quality \n- Also to contribute monetarily in the household so that all the burden does not come on their husbands \n-Other\n- Depending on water availability they either plant cotton or paddy – if more water then paddy. \n The women have attended BC trainings They said that the FF conducts training once during the sowing season and then another one during the season. Monthly one or two meetings take place for half an hour to one hour. \nTopics covered: Intercropping, usage of bio pesticides, PPE kits usage, usage of cow urine, cow dung, neem oil, proper hand wash, precautions to be taken by pregnant women, health issues pertaining to women, \nConvenience &amp;amp; facilities provided: Training are conducted at their convenient time, They are provided chairs during the trianing \nSolving of doubts: They are able to easily communicate their doubts with FF and they also said that the FFs don&amp;#x27;t treat male and female farmers differently, all the topics are well explained to both the genders. \nAll farmers maintaining FFB - they write daily expenses , what plants they are growing, seeds cost, fertilisers cost, tractor rent, etc. \nWhen asked about the extent to which the training adds to your knowledge and awareness - they said ‘Medium’ \nThey like attending trainings and don&amp;#x27;t get bored since it is interactive \nWomen-only training are also conducted on bio pesticides, etc. (last conducted during sowing season) \nSharing of knowledge: Women share their knowledge with other non-BC farmers\nFarmers who have cattle make use of it to get organic pesticides; others who don&amp;#x27;t buy it from shops. \nFarmers mentioned that the pesiticides costs are very high and yield is low. \nWhat do they like most about the BCI program? Avoiding pesticides - using organic fertilisers and intercropping. \n Demos are also held at frequent intervals - where they make placards of slogans like ‘Do intercropping’- this was even the non-BC farmers get educated \nExposure and field visits are also conducted – at a convenient time. Farmers learned about the exposure visits by seeing on neighboring farmers \nFarmers who attend exposure visits - it depends on their transportation availability, per batch 18 farmers will attend. \nAs per the women - most impactful is - Exposure visits and rewarding of farmers with high yield by BC Reduced usage of chemicals - they are aware they should not use heavy chemicals as it will affect their health. \nIncrease in yield, good quality crops \nHigh market rates - earlier it was Rs.1500/- to Rs. 1800/- per quintal, it is very less. After joining in BCI it is an increased quintal rate of Rs.7500/-.\nFarmers have adopted inter cropping and border cropping (yellow gram) after joining the BC program. \nAble to grow 2 crops yearly - one is cotton and other we grow vegetables which we use in our household. \nAdoption of PPE kits\nUpgrade in their standard of living: The women said that after being part of BC - many have purchased TV, fridge, bike, tractor \nThey make 20 to 30k profit per acre per season \nOverall, less expenditure \nThe women said that they have seen a change in the past 5 years - earlier they used to use pesticides (urea, DAP, cocktails) due to which crop used to get full damaged but now using organic fertilizers &amp;gt;&amp;gt; overall income increased and fertilizer investment decreased \nFarmers not using red color pesticides as they understand it is harmful to their health.\n\n Women also mentioned that after being part of the BC program, husbands are allowing them for meetings and venturing outside the house without any hesitation.\n\n Role of men &amp;amp; women on farms: \n- Females typically handle tasks like picking flowers from cotton plants, while male farmers press the cotton, fill the bags, and carry them. Both men and women contribute equally to the work, though their tasks differ. \n- Women are more involved in activities like picking and sowing, which are traditionally considered women&amp;#x27;s work. In contrast, men focus on spraying, applying fertilizers, carrying heavy bags, and managing water flow. \n- Agricultural field work usually takes place from 9 am to 5 pm. \n- However, if they have other responsibilities, many male workers spend about three hours in the field before moving on to other livelihood activities.\n\nEducation and jobs attained by farmers children \n- Farmers do not allow their children on field as it affects their health and education \n- Many of the children have completed their education, starting from 10th grade and progressing to at least graduation, with some attaining post-graduation. \n- After completing their studies, many have secured private sector jobs, with both males and females working, including those employed in Hyderabad. \n- Among the group of approximately 100 youth, all are currently engaged in various jobs.\n- They dont want their kids to be in agriculture (during the FGD kids of two ladies were sitting with us - one had a degree in BSc. Agriculture and other too was pursuing a similar degree) Effect of climate change \n- The farmers said that if there are no rains they will suffer huge losses. Only 2 to 5% of people have borewells \n- If the rains are no there they grow fodder crops and give it to their cattle \n\n- Depending on the quality of cotton, they decide who to sell to - if good quality then they go to ginner and sell and if not so good then vendors who come to village. \n- During summers, the ladies are also enrolled for the ‘100 days work’ program \n- All the ladies had bank accounts \n\nSuggestion: They would like to be provided with good quality seeds / subsidy on seeds.\n Field Notes_Bheempally_F program farmers.docx Choppadandi (INTL 23) NaN - Part of program since: From 3 years they are part of BC program - but have been growing cotton from 20 years \n- Women said that they use chemicals \n- Land owners grow paddy and for cotton these women go on other farms \n- They use organic fertilizers on their own land (neem oil)\n- Their husbands also working on cotton farms (on leased lands) \n- No soil testing has been done so they have no idea what to grow \n- Support from family: They dont tell anything to their husbands about things learned in training as they say they already know \nBut in terms of support from family, it is there. Husbands are supportive of women working in the field. No. of trainings conducted: In 2024, till now 3 women trainings have been conducted \nFor men, season wise, monthly 2 trainings They have got trainings only on health and certain precautions to take and safety \nTopics covered: In the training they have been taught precautionary measures like Covering of hair, covering of nose and moth to avoid dust, covering of cotton with proper cover and in proper places, pregnant women should not involve in chemical and pesticides usage, avoid child labour, practive intercropping to improve fertility in the land. \nEvery BC farmer follows the above practices. \nFreely speak in meetings: During the meetings, husband and wife both speak up freely and there is no restriction. If women have any doubts they ask FF \nConvenience &amp;amp; facilities provided: During the training, BC provides chairs, toilet facilities are taken care of and also water. Trainings are conducted from 7 to 8 PM. \nWhen asked about why they do not attend the trainings - they said that if meetings are conducted nearby they will be able to attend. \n\n - There have been no demos, rallies organized for BC women farmers \n- Demos for men farmers have been conducted on intercropping, nav dhanya usage, etc. Practices followed\nSticky traps \nMen use neem oil in field women dont know how it is to be used \nThey use cocktails \nThey use ‘green color’ pesticides \nThey use mask in field \nIntercropping and border cropping followed \n\nWomen on pesticide usage\nThe women reported using bio pesticides, nav-dhanya and they also use gloves \nWomen are not averse to organic pesticides but they have tried using it in the past and it didn&amp;#x27;t help them so they don&amp;#x27;t believe in using organic pesticides. \nThey use urea, potassium- before 10 years they used to use organic - but now chemical as chemicals lead to faster growth as compared to organic\nOnce they tried using neem oil for killing pests but they did not see any result - lost trust on organic \n Women said that the training has had no impact on their empowerment NaN Suggestion on training: There is no new / special information that we have come to know about, meetings are very lengthy / time consuming which makes it difficult for them to stay full time as they have to attend to house chores AND agriculture work. They suggested keeping the meeting for half an hour. \n\nOverall Suggestions: Women said that they would like to have more season wise trainings but only night / evening time convenient for them as they are free then \n\nThey also suggested to provide cotton storing bags. Big farmers are able to purchase storage materials but small farmers find it difficult. It would be nice if BC could provide us with good quality storage bags \n Field notes_Choppadandi_F program farmers NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Non Program Farmers (Female) NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Gender Analysis Matrix Awareness of the Better Cotton program Experience as a non-program farmer participant in WWF/Better Cotton training programs Expectations as a non-program farmer from the Better Cotton training programs Knowledge, attitude and practices (capacity) related to cotton farming Other topics Transcript NaN NaN NaN Bheemadevarapally (INTL 01) NaN - This village was newly considered for the BC program. \n- Women did not see training conducted in the village - they are not aware of it. \n- They grow cotton .. and maize, red gram, etc. as intercrop \n- Women mentioned that rains are a big issue - due to lack of it their crops get affected.

However, since joining the BCI program, they have shifted from using DAP urea to using organic fertilizers like animal dung, as promoted by the project.\nFarmers expect to receive seeds, such as vegetable and cotton seeds, on a free or subsidized basis. They also expect to receive PPE kits for agricultural work.\nAny income from cotton farming is used for the family, with profits contributing to family expenses like shopping. There is an expectation that any training or meetings should lead to direct benefits, such as financial support or resources.\n\nChallenges in Training Implementation: Despite attending meetings, 70% of farmers are not following the recommended practices due to negligence or other priorities. Farmers attended 4 to 5 meetings where topics like cotton crop precautions and organic fertilizer usage were discussed.\nMost cotton-related meetings are attended by men.\nMeetings after 7 pm are said to be more convenient, especially during the summer when they have no work and children are not in school.\nWomen prefer separate meetings due to discomfort with men, especially as many men attend meetings drunken - they reported disturbed by the smell of alcohol.\n Usefulness of Trainings: Farmers found the trainings useful, particularly for growing Better Cotton. The meetings helped them understand the benefits of organic fertilizers and the importance of using PPE kits.\nChallenges in Training Implementation: Despite attending meetings, 70% of farmers are not following the recommended practices due to negligence or other priorities.\n\nDemonstrations and Exposure Visits: Some farmers have participated in exposure visits to other agricultural fields. These visits and demonstrations (e.g., on border crops, intercropping, and bio-fertilizers) were found to be beneficial.\nParticipation in rallies was low, especially among women due to domestic responsibilities. NaN Shift to Organic Practices: There has been a shift toward using organic fertilizers and border crops, which has led to an increase in yield. However, farmers are still heavily reliant on labor, which drives up costs.Children&amp;#x27;s Involvement: On holidays, children help with agricultural work, and their education continues. \nBoys typically pursues post-graduation. The average marriage age is after completing education, around 21 years. Education of girls mostly stop after marriage Women’s Involvement: Women are increasingly participating in agricultural decisions and meetings.\nHousehold Decision-Making: Women engage in mutual discussions with their husbands regarding farming decisions, and they feel empowered to suggest changes, although not all suggestions are accepted.\nSelf-Help Groups (SHGs): SHG meetings focus primarily on savings rather than agriculture. Female farmers expressed a desire for SHG activities to also include agricultural topics.

Attendance in trainings and other capacity strengthening activities The women have attended BC trainings No. of trainings conducted: In 2024, till now 3 women trainings have been conducted \nFor men, season wise, monthly 2 trainings Effectiveness of trainings and other capacity strengthening activities They said that the FF conducts training once during the sowing season and then another one during the season. Monthly one or two meetings take place for half an hour to one hour. \nTopics covered: Intercropping, usage of bio pesticides, PPE kits usage, usage of cow urine, cow dung, neem oil, proper hand wash, precautions to be taken by pregnant women, health issues pertaining to women, \nConvenience &amp;amp; facilities provided: Training are conducted at their convenient time, They are provided chairs during the trianing \nSolving of doubts: They are able to easily communicate their doubts with FF and they also said that the FFs don&amp;#x27;t treat male and female farmers differently, all the topics are well explained to both the genders. \nAll farmers maintaining FFB - they write daily expenses , what plants they are growing, seeds cost, fertilisers cost, tractor rent, etc. \nWhen asked about the extent to which the training adds to your knowledge and awareness - they said ‘Medium’ \nThey like attending trainings and don&amp;#x27;t get bored since it is interactive \nWomen-only training are also conducted on bio pesticides, etc. (last conducted during sowing season) \nSharing of knowledge: Women share their knowledge with other non-BC farmers\nFarmers who have cattle make use of it to get organic pesticides; others who don&amp;#x27;t buy it from shops. \nFarmers mentioned that the pesiticides costs are very high and yield is low. \nWhat do they like most about the BCI program? Avoiding pesticides - using organic fertilisers and intercropping. \n They have got trainings only on health and certain precautions to take and safety \nTopics covered: In the training they have been taught precautionary measures like Covering of hair, covering of nose and moth to avoid dust, covering of cotton with proper cover and in proper places, pregnant women should not involve in chemical and pesticides usage, avoid child labour, practive intercropping to improve fertility in the land. \nEvery BC farmer follows the above practices. \nFreely speak in meetings: During the meetings, husband and wife both speak up freely and there is no restriction. If women have any doubts they ask FF \nConvenience &amp;amp; facilities provided: During the training, BC provides chairs, toilet facilities are taken care of and also water. Trainings are conducted from 7 to 8 PM. \nWhen asked about why they do not attend the trainings - they said that if meetings are conducted nearby they will be able to attend. \n\n Effectiveness of other capacity strengthening initiatives (demonstrations/ exposure visits/ activities etc) Demos are also held at frequent intervals - where they make placards of slogans like ‘Do intercropping’- this was even the non-BC farmers get educated \nExposure and field visits are also conducted – at a convenient time. Farmers learned about the exposure visits by seeing on neighboring farmers \nFarmers who attend exposure visits - it depends on their transportation availability, per batch 18 farmers will attend. \nAs per the women - most impactful is - Exposure visits and rewarding of farmers with high yield by BC - There have been no demos, rallies organized for BC women farmers \n- Demos for men farmers have been conducted on intercropping, nav dhanya usage, etc. Change in knowledge, attitude and practices (capacity) related to cotton farming Reduced usage of chemicals - they are aware they should not use heavy chemicals as it will affect their health. \nIncrease in yield, good quality crops \nHigh market rates - earlier it was Rs.1500/- to Rs. 1800/- per quintal, it is very less. After joining in BCI it is an increased quintal rate of Rs.7500/-.\nFarmers have adopted inter cropping and border cropping (yellow gram) after joining the BC program. \nAble to grow 2 crops yearly - one is cotton and other we grow vegetables which we use in our household. \nAdoption of PPE kits\nUpgrade in their standard of living: The women said that after being part of BC - many have purchased TV, fridge, bike, tractor \nThey make 20 to 30k profit per acre per season \nOverall, less expenditure \nThe women said that they have seen a change in the past 5 years - earlier they used to use pesticides (urea, DAP, cocktails) due to which crop used to get full damaged but now using organic fertilizers &amp;gt;&amp;gt; overall income increased and fertilizer investment decreased \nFarmers not using red color pesticides as they understand it is harmful to their health.\n\n Practices followed\nSticky traps \nMen use neem oil in field women dont know how it is to be used \nThey use cocktails \nThey use ‘green color’ pesticides \nThey use mask in field \nIntercropping and border cropping followed \n\nWomen on pesticide usage\nThe women reported using bio pesticides, nav-dhanya and they also use gloves \nWomen are not averse to organic pesticides but they have tried using it in the past and it didn&amp;#x27;t help them so they don&amp;#x27;t believe in using organic pesticides. \nThey use urea, potassium- before 10 years they used to use organic - but now chemical as chemicals lead to faster growth as compared to organic\nOnce they tried using neem oil for killing pests but they did not see any result - lost trust on organic \n Change in agency/empowerment\n Women also mentioned that after being part of the BC program, husbands are allowing them for meetings and venturing outside the house without any hesitation.\n\n Women said that the training has had no impact on their empowerment Role of men &amp;amp; women on farms and farmers education aspirations for their children Role of men &amp;amp; women on farms: \n- Females typically handle tasks like picking flowers from cotton plants, while male farmers press the cotton, fill the bags, and carry them. Both men and women contribute equally to the work, though their tasks differ. \n- Women are more involved in activities like picking and sowing, which are traditionally considered women&amp;#x27;s work. In contrast, men focus on spraying, applying fertilizers, carrying heavy bags, and managing water flow. \n- Agricultural field work usually takes place from 9 am to 5 pm. \n- However, if they have other responsibilities, many male workers spend about three hours in the field before moving on to other livelihood activities.\n\nEducation and jobs attained by farmers children \n- Farmers do not allow their children on field as it affects their health and education \n- Many of the children have completed their education, starting from 10th grade and progressing to at least graduation, with some attaining post-graduation. \n- After completing their studies, many have secured private sector jobs, with both males and females working, including those employed in Hyderabad. \n- Among the group of approximately 100 youth, all are currently engaged in various jobs.\n- They dont want their kids to be in agriculture (during the FGD kids of two ladies were sitting with us - one had a degree in BSc. Agriculture and other too was pursuing a similar degree) NaN Other topics covered Effect of climate change \n- The farmers said that if there are no rains they will suffer huge losses. Only 2 to 5% of people have borewells \n- If the rains are no there they grow fodder crops and give it to their cattle \n\n- Depending on the quality of cotton, they decide who to sell to - if good quality then they go to ginner and sell and if not so good then vendors who come to village. \n- During summers, the ladies are also enrolled for the ‘100 days work’ program \n- All the ladies had bank accounts \n\nSuggestion: They would like to be provided with good quality seeds / subsidy on seeds.\n Suggestion on training: There is no new / special information that we have come to know about, meetings are very lengthy / time consuming which makes it difficult for them to stay full time as they have to attend to house chores AND agriculture work. They suggested keeping the meeting for half an hour. \n\nOverall Suggestions: Women said that they would like to have more season wise trainings but only night / evening time convenient for them as they are free then \n\nThey also suggested to provide cotton storing bags. Big farmers are able to purchase storage materials but small farmers find it difficult. It would be nice if BC could provide us with good quality storage bags \n --- Sheet: KPI 2.2_non prog farmers --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 Unnamed: 2 NaN NaN NaN Participant Bheemadevarapally (INTL 01) Rukhmapur (INTL 23) Gender Analysis Matrix NaN NaN Awareness of the Better Cotton program - This village was newly considered for the BC program. \n- Women did not see training conducted in the village - they are not aware of it. \n- They grow cotton .. and maize, red gram, etc. as intercrop \n- Women mentioned that rains are a big issue - due to lack of it their crops get affected.

This review is limited to understanding the system without being influenced by existing data or statistical analysis.\n\nRisk Profiling:\nStakeholder Engagement: Verifiers conduct interviews with three different stakeholders who are not directly related to the PU (e.g., KVK, Sarpanch, school teachers) without the PU’s knowledge. These interviews help assess potential risks and gather insights into issues such as child labor, farmer suicides, and other relevant sectoral challenges.\n\nField Verification:\nArrival and Initial Procedures:\nOpening Meeting: Verifiers hold an opening meeting with field-level farmers, PU managers, and officials.\nInterviews and Clarifications: Interviews are conducted with various stakeholders, including farmers, PU managers, and other relevant staff. If any discrepancies or unclear areas arise, clarification meetings are held.\nField Visits: A small team (typically 2-3 people) conducts farm visits to observe and verify field-level documentation and practices.\nOn-the-Field Activities:\nVerification of Documentation: Field documentation is checked to ensure accuracy and compliance with BCI standards.\nInterviews: Workers, farmers, and PU staff are interviewed to cross-check information.\nExternal Source Engagement: Engagement with external sources, such as community leaders or local authorities, is conducted to gather additional insights.\nData Collection: All gathered data is meticulously recorded for further analysis.\nData Triangulation:\n\nDaily Triangulation: Verifiers carry out daily data triangulation, comparing and cross-referencing new data with previous indicators.\nDebate and Consensus: Different verification teams may have varying perspectives and findings. These are debated internally to reach the most accurate and factual conclusions before reporting.\nReporting:\n\nData Submission: The collected and triangulated data is submitted to BCI.\nReview and Amendments: BCI may request modifications or cross-check the data before making any decisions.\nFinal Report: A final report is prepared, encapsulating all findings and recommendations.\n\nPost-Verification:\nNo Decision-Making Role: After submitting the data to BCI, third-party verifiers do not participate in the decision-making process regarding the PU’s eligibility for licensing.\nLicensing Considerations: BCI&amp;#x27;s licensing decisions are based on the submitted data, the PU&amp;#x27;s history with RIR submissions, the credibility of the data, and the quality of communication.\nBCI Involvement:\nLimited Accompaniment: BCI staff do not accompany the verifiers at all times, ensuring the independence of the third-party verification process.\nBCI supports verifiers with date coordination, Point of Contact (PoC) arrangements, and training - 7 trainings- (both online and offline) to enhance the credibility of assessments.\n\nTopics discussed:\nStandards and Updated Procedures of BC, Recent Developments and Informations in the cotton sector, Trainings are held on pre/mid/end season-wise themes. Sample Size Calculation:\n\nSampling is conducted using purposive sampling, with a typical sample size of 15 farmers, which is considered adequate and precise.\n\nSample Selection:\nBCI provides the sample size and representation guidelines. The third-party verifier selects the sample within these guidelines, ensuring it is inclusive and representative of the entire PU.\nFactors such as gender representation and geography (e.g., irrigation levels) are considered during sample selection.\n\nChallenges in Sampling:\n- Local partners inability to properly execute and assist the 3rd Party (leads to more time spend on engaging with the PU)\n- Time constraints, especially when the sample includes distant locations (e.g., villages over 100 km apart), making it difficult to thoroughly cross-check the farmers&amp;#x27; list and other data.\n The level of confidence in the current assurance processes is generally high.\nThe robustness of the sample selection process, despite the small size, contributes positively to confidence.\nFactors Positively Influencing Confidence:\n\nThe ability of the third-party verifier to choose the sample independently.\nThe systematic approach of daily data triangulation and cross-checking.\n\nWithin the 3 days on the field days, continuous cross checking are carried out \nTriangulation within different sources - Govt, reports etc\nTriangulation with past yrs data (adoption data of this year vis a vis last year)\n\nIndependent teams can have different findings - debated and cross verified\nUploaded to Excel, Review - Cross Checkings with the data collector - Desk Review (before the final submission to BC) is done by increasing the sample size etc if there&amp;#x27;s a discrepancy or confusion. \n\nFactors Negatively Influencing Confidence:\nDuration constraints (e.g., the 3-day fieldwork period) limit in-depth investigations\n\nLimitation in shared data: Data shared should be broad. Currently it is only from the respective PU - rather than the overall data making it difficult to crosscheck (There has been instances where the PUs/LGs disqualified often change their name (INTL X to INTL Y) with the farmers still same. Since the Verifier is only given 3 days onfield - time constraints force such instances difficult to be caught) Copy of Third Party Verifier-Yunus Interview (MD) NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN BC Staff NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Overview of the Better Cotton Assurance approach Roles and responsibilities of BC staff\n Compliance to credibility\n Sampling Level of confidence in assurance results Link to transcript NaN Lalit Sharma Assurance approach (to understand if PUs are complying to BC standards or not - includes lists etc.) \n- It differs between the PU - licensing for old vs new \n- Partners conduct internal assessment of PU before BC licensing \n- Old PUs - assessment visit, license for three years, whenever it is getting expired BC will do it. \n- Surveillance assessment is for those who have an active license - incase there is any change in farmer participation or if there is any red flag raised in previous visits - then this assessment is conducted. \n- Assurance activities are mostly time bound \n- Assurance is an umbrella term - licensing is just a part of it. Even assessment comes under it like data verification, etc.\n\nAssessment process (Assurance is the umbrella term and assessment is a part of it)\n- There are principles and criteria in place which have some indicators in them\n- PUs have to comply to these principles \n- Assurance team comprises - 2 sets of assessors (BC + third party verifiers) - 4 organizations currently empanelled as TPV. People like lalit who do assessment - 4 to 5 people \n- PUs are intimated one week in advance - a template is shared with them which outlines the requirements. There are some docs also which are required to be submitted by PU before the assessment - we give them three days to give it to us.\n Role of Lalit : \n- He has joined BC 4 years ago and is working as Assurance Cooridnator &amp;gt;&amp;gt; he has a reporting manager \n- He is involved in - Assurance activities: \n- Data management (farmers list, adjusted figures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data) \n- Assurance activities calendar preparation (licensing, etc.) \n- Training of PUMs / FFs on various lists\n- Purpose of assurance - whether PUs are complying to standards or not. Within assurance we have different compliances (like list) + assessment conducted every three years. Assurance activities are defined set of requirement for eg. data - early season data, adjusted figures after one month of sowing, farm level data, self assessment, etc. \n- Before the start of the season we approach program partners to ask them about sowing dates, harvesting - based on these dates we decide the calendar activity for PUs \n- Lalit gets data in separate files as per INTL\nExpectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors: \n- Requirements to partners made clear \n- We plan our activities in advance so that partners are aware of when to submit \n- We also ensure that data from the field is of good quality - we thoroughly investigate it. \n- All communication from our end should be on time so that PCs have time to complete on time. \nRole of BC staff &amp;amp; TPV same - 3 day exercise \n- 1st day: opening meeting - PUs give introduction / PPT - interview with staff members, During this meeting, they also inform the villages that the team will be visiting the next day\n- 2nd day: 2 LGs are covered - 5 farmers from each LG minimum - farmers + workers are interviewed. On this day we tell them about the next day&amp;#x27;s villages. \n- 3rd day: Morning - 1 LG - 5 farmers meeting - Post lunch: closing remarks / meeting. We dont give any recommendations or idea of how the PU is doing - all that goes in the report. \n- After this - we make a report and submit it to the India Assurance Team and also to the global assurance team. Licensing is in their hands. \n- BC staff and TPV visits separately to separate PUs - we have a ratio of 60:40 - 60% assessment will be done by TPV and 40% by BC. \n- Assessment process same as above \n- There is flexibility in conducting the interviews - more than 3 LGs can also be interviewed - minimum is 3 \n- TPV also has to submit a report to India Assurance Team\nSupport provided by BC to TPV and WWF \n- CS vertical - Relationship management team - in touch with WWF Telangana - we provide the standard protocol to the partners - it is up to them how they want to design the meetings / training calendar -they just have to comply with the principles. Incase PC wants any clarification or want to access a knowledge partner then BC conducts TOT. \n- We have separate templates for different data sets - we train the PUMs and PCs on how to fill this template - since RIR is technical. \n Integrity of Data: \n- Earlier we had encountered the issue of fake farmers - when we receive the list of farmers from PU we cross check by calling a few farmers and asking them if they know they are a part of the BC program. \n- We have details of PU Staff - who are responsible for particular LGs - we call at least 5-10 farmers under each FF (non lead farmers since they are reliable) \n- Random selection of 5-10 farmers - we used to ask their names, father names, whether they know BC program \n- Right now they dont do this calling exercise - we have told partners that we can do this cross check anytime \n- Processes followed currently - whenever they receive a file they look from quality POV - correct format, units, duplication, etc. \n- For different data sets we have different cleaning exercises. For eg. RIR is checked by the global team. We just glance and check for basic things and follow the global team - they do a deep dive \nFactors considered for credibility in assessment process \n- Process are designed in a way that is impartial \n- It is recommended to assessors not to give suggestions to PUs during their visits \n- Anti bribery policy - no gifts to be considered from PUs \nRisks considered \n- When we used to inform PU about the assessment dates they used to revert saying there is xx festival - so we have asked partners to share dates with us \n- Recently 1 PU told us that there is some staffing issue and all the FFs had got terminated so they asked for time extension - sometimes even PUM not well etc. - so if particular staff is not available we assess how crucial they are for our assessment - if not very crucial then we are ok and continue with the assessment \n- Weather issues - farmers are not in mood to talk when weather is not good \nEfficiency in assurance process \n- Approach is good enough \n- We have an arm for CS also which is unique to BC \n- We have a whole picture in the three day assessment - at the end of the day we want to understand the impact \n- We only talk to 15 farmers but this is good to get an idea - as general practices are same across LGs \nFactors contributing to non compliance from farmers \n- Adoption of PPE kit - we want farmers to use them but weather conditions are such they dont wear \n- Sometimes extension agents (pesticide vendors) tell farmers to mix chemicals \n- Certain chemicals BC bans but it is cheap and easily available to farmers so they opt for it (for eg. monocrotophos) \n- We have run campaigns to discourage such behavior\nHow do the existing assurance systems and processes work to mitigate the risks/ influence associated with free riders and non-BC farmers?\nThis will remain a challenge - we dont have details of ALL farmers since we dont have resources for that. Even in the PURE we cant say there wont be free riders \n\n\n - In the limited time we have (3 days) - 15 farmers is fair - but we also do FGDs to cross check \n- Sample size is fixed for us - 15 - random sampling \n- We also talk to local resources - pesticides shop owner, sarpanch, etc. \n- Therefore , 15 farmers + FGDs + local resources is good enough \n- We are well versed on how to talk to farmers and we are also well versed with the geography - makes our job easier \n- He feels the sample size is representative - sampling is done on our own as in the LG selection is on us. We do it on following factors - based on rain fed farmers, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, response of FF in opening meeting \n- Selection bias prevention - Assessors select the LGs \n- Respondent bias prevention - we are as objective as possible \n- Scope of the assessment (duration and sample) limit the assessors’ ability \nIn case we feel that three LGs is not enough or if something is inconclusive - we are free to consider 4 or 5 LGs \n- Challenges in assurance process \n- Nothing as such - just the risks i mentioned above\n- Remote locations - traveling becomes too far - even between LG farmers \n - Means of verification used to validate/triangulate the findings - FGDs + local resource information\n- For rating of level of confidence please see detailed transcript Notes_Assurance_BC Staff_Lalit NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Satish Botla. WWF PC About Licensing: \n\n- Rigorous audits done by BC for licensing of PU - 4 days of audit \n- They choose the sample - not WWF. \n- Management - checking of docs, what are the planned activities, activity wise success indicators, etc. \n- Interview with PUM - They talk to PUM - as per BCI PUM, a very important / effective POC. - - They feel, if PUM is effective then the farmers will reap the benefits. Even the project - coordinator is not allowed to speak much during these meetings with PUM. \n- Field level - they will select some LGs (BC informs only 24 hours before about the sample to avoid any manipulation) -Farmer interviews are done- they ask BCI principles being followed are not - they check farmers knowledge and then the adoption - two main factors. \n- Other stakeholders - Workers - BC also interacts with field workers\n- Verifiers will cross check with fertilizer shops and cross check if they are selling organic fertilizers mentioned by farmers in the vicinity,\n- They also check with schools asking them if there is any child labor, etc. \n- Closing day - major findings are discussed \n- They prepare a report and submit it to BC India and they decide if the license will be continued or not. Types of licenses - Compliance with observation (means farmers may have knowledge but adoption is less - so they will give chance to see if there is any growth happening) \n- 64 Indicators under BCI - non-compliance with any one of the indicators - license is lost. \n- Licensing done once in three years. INTL 23 is pending for licensing this year.

High: Due to systematic sampling, multiple levels of cross-checking, and credibility checks. Sindhu - PUM INTL01 Processes under MEL: \n- Cross checking: For each document there is a % which she cross checks. From each FF, 10 to 20% data is considered. So say if an FF has 4 villages under her - from each village 10% is considered and that sample is called and cross checked. \n- Each list / document is cross checked 10-20% (if the population is high) and 5 to 10% (if population is low) \n- This % was fixed internally by WWF. \n- APUM cross checks 40 to 50% \n- Project coordinator checks 3 to 5% \n- As per her, this process is reliable. If she finds any issues - she again tells the FF to cross check - so the process is very reliable. \n- Data is collected in google sheets, hard copies. Every document has a hardcopy - little difficult to manage but major data on google sheets. \n\nManagement strategies: \n- We have a monitoring sheet with us when we go on field, she notes down in the sheet. \n- She also carries her diary and makes notes of suggestions, etc. We also come back and discuss with KVKs. \n- There is a whatsapp group of FFs + KVKs - so if FFs are unable to answer anything, they step in and answer. \n- Whatsapp group of only FFs + Sindhu \n- Whatsapp group with farmers \n- Village wise whatsapp group also \n- They put weather forecast info also \n- These groups also help farmers who have missed training to come to speed \n\nFactors that driver her: Her parents were farmers, she is interested in this and has a degree as well in soil science. \n\nNumber of lists: Soil health (soil organic carbon, etc. is analyzed, we cross check if decreased or increased) &amp;gt; Early season estimates (farmers list) &amp;gt; well monitoring&amp;gt; Demos are planned &amp;gt; PRA data &amp;gt; Activity / monitoring plan &amp;gt; adoption plan &amp;gt; FFBs &amp;gt; RIR (post harvest estimates) \nWhat is the Farmers list approach? LGs, farmer codes for individual farmers, co farmers, irrigation data etc. (for responsibilities wrt each list see detailed transcript)\n\nHow is the sample collected? \n- APUM - 40 to 50% of type of data, PUM - 10%, Satish sir - 3 to 5% \n- Demos are held based on seasons - for eg. sowing then spraying and Rallies (staff and villagers walking together with placards) are held in sept - august - for eg. not to use highly chemical pesticides, use PPE Kits, etc. - this way even Non - BC farmers get educated. \n\nTime spent on MEL work - Season wise lists are prepared - so her work also varies accordingly. Currently time for farmers list so her 1-2 weeks goes in that. After that some other data set. NaN NaN NaN NaN Nikita (INTL 23) MEL approach &amp;amp; its implementation on ground \n- Activity plan main thing &amp;gt;&amp;gt; CS at FF level cascaded to farmer level \n- After farmer trainings &amp;gt; adoption data collected \n- Analysis done based on past years data points and current year \n- Based on the findings, we will suggest / improve trainings \n\nRoles and responsibilities\n- Nikita prepares 15 day timeline for FFs and keeps them aware of the deadline \n- Review with FF every 15 day - meeting\n Different types of data collected:\n- For every training / activity we do we maintain documents even if not mandated by BC \n- For eg., for farmers list we have an internal template (non BCI) - after all the cleaning it is copy pasted in the BC template \n- RIR \n- Adoption data \n- Continuous improvement plan / time bound plan - for few activities 100% adoption is not there by farmers (eg. PPE kit) such critical activities we take under the improvement plan and then we ensure that the adoption increases to 100% in the next three years. Max 10 such activities and minimum 5 such activities\n \nFor detailed MEL activities see Transcript \n\nSupport provided by BC for monitoring: \n- Online training given on RIR - - how to collect data, etc. \n- Even Satish sir gives training in local language\n - Data is collected in timely manner \n- Quality control protocol &amp;gt;&amp;gt; APUM checks 20 to 30% PUM checks 10 to 20% &amp;amp; PC 3 to 5% &amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is applicable to any data set \n- Steps taken to rectify errors &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If any mismatches are found in first round of 10%, (more than 2) PUM checks for another 10% - if mistake found there also then entire data set sent back to FF for refilling / cross checking \n- Challenges: no big issue. Just sometimes farmers may give different answers so in that case we ask the farmers itself if their land size (for eg) has changed, compared to previous year \n- Farmers are cooperative with PUM / FF - we dont tell them it is wrong we just ask them the question again.\n - For every village there is a lead farmer + random picking from LG . Instead of calling we also go and talk to them. (PUM asks Lead farmer of that LG on pesticide data, or other data) \n- It does represent the entire population since if we combine the PUM, APUM, PC - majority of the data is cross checked. \n- Farmers that are chosen by APUM are different, in the sense, PUM choose different set of farmers, PC chooses different. \n- Eg. There are 97 farmers under one LG then they will choose 10% of that LG = 9.7 (10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 9 farmers + 1 lead farmer.\n- Challenges in doing sampling: no challenges as such\n MEL model being representative of farmers: Yes it is representative\n\nDo you think the MEL systems are efficient? \n10% is currently done, for the errors to lessen it would be better if we considered 20 to 30% . Due to heavy documentation work it becomes difficult. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a59FNTY_HeADS838yND25HNdLn6oGWzsFVTv8nD1Mfo/edit Nikita handles a variety of data critical to the success of her projects:\n\n1. Annual Planning Data: This includes developing time-bound plans based on key issues collected by Field Facilitators (FFs). Each year, she prepares an activity plan and a monitoring plan.\n\n2. Soil Sample Testing: After FFs compile soil testing data, Nikita inputs it into a prescribed BC format and shares it with the project coordinator.\n\n3. Monthly Action Plans for FFs: She manages and reviews the action plans that outline monthly activities for FFs.\n\n4. Pesticide Lists: She maintains a list of locally used pesticides.\n\n5. Disadvantage List: Identifies physically handicapped individuals for livelihood support and collaborates with government schemes.\n\n6. Degraded Lands Identification: Manages data on degraded lands, including identification and restoration plans.\n\n7. FFB Updation: Routine updates of the FFB\n\n8. Adoption and RIR Data: Manages data related to adoption of practices and the Results Indicator Report (RIR).\n\nData Management Process:\n\nNikita manages data seasonally, distributing hard copies to FFs who use internal WWF Excel templates and Google Sheets for data entry. FFs collect data from farmers and submit it to Nikita, she then verifies the information through calls or in-person visits to resolve any issues. The APUM also reviews the data before it is forwarded to Nikita and then to the project coordinator. This structured process ensures that data is consistently updated and accurately maintained\n\nFarmers List Management:\n\nNikita oversees the annual updating of the farmers&amp;#x27; list, which involves FFs visiting villages to identify and enroll cotton-growing farmers. Each year, FFs update the list to remove farmers who no longer grow cotton and add new farmers. This process ensures that the data remains current and relevant.\n\nData Quality and Integrity:\n\nTo maintain data quality, Nikita cross-checks the data by randomly selecting 10% of farmers for verification. Any discrepancies found lead to a thorough review of the entire data set by the FF. The APUM also contributes by cross-checking and occasionally entering data. Nikita ensures that 10% of data from each village is reviewed, while the APUM checks 20-30% and the project coordinator audits 3-5%. This multi-tiered approach to data quality and integrity supports the accuracy and reliability of the information collected. NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN BC Staff NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Overview of the MEL approach Implementation of the MEL system Quality Assurance Sampling Level of confidence in MEL results Transcript NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Sonal Dhingra - MEL We have split data into two categories - \n- Reach data (area, number of farmers &amp;amp; production) - for each PU we get reach data \n- RIR - Result Indicators Report - sample of farmers taken from each PU and we try to understand - what was the water use, pesticide use (bio vs chemicals) \n- Sonal majorly deals with RIR data \nWhat is her role? / activities \n- Sonal is the senior coordinator - global MEL - she works with one more coordinator who looks after reach (Phelix). Shannon - boss of both. \n- We receive this data 12 weeks after the harvest - Sonal does gap analysis (basic completeness check, data validity - eg, area irrigated cannot be higher than area under cultivation, if all active ingredients of a pesticide are listed in the data or not, etc.) - whatever is possible \n- If data is not ok - we reach out to partners \n- Data is recorded in a particular format - from FFB to RIR - the data is not transferred without issues. - so gap analysis helps. \n- After this basic check, we do outlier check - we compare PUs average with the farms average - in terms of yield, if a PUs yield is 135 kg per ha but for a particular farm it is 1000 kg per ha - then we question the data \n- Sometimes it is an error and sometimes it is a genuine issue \n- So there is a lot of back and forth between country MEL, global MEL, partners \n- Farmer level - FFB &amp;gt; FF &amp;gt; PUM + MEL person at partner level &amp;gt; RIR \n- Hidden layer between FFB and PUM - partners maintain an internal excel which is easy - they agg values and they input the values in the RIR \n- Mostly PUMs fill the RIR with help of FFs or MEL person at partner level\n Set of Activities under MEL (done by Sonal) \n- Gap analysis\n- Outlier check (PU’s average with farmer average is compared - involves lot of back and forth - this is a very big issue as it delays sending data further)\n- Data updation on Cotton Cloud (database) - Power BI DB \n \nReporting requirements that Better Cotton MEL mandates from the PU:\n- Reach data - broken down in multiple parts - you also get in early season estimates - farmers who are expected to grow cotton this year, etc. we update this figure in terms of area, production, and final number of farmers who are growing cotton (late estimate data) . \n- Then post harvest data - it will come at the same time as RIR \n- RIR data - Main three sheets - area &amp;amp; production, fertilizer use, pesticide use and three more sheets -\n- Number of training that happens in the entire season (description, training, duration, attendance, etc.) training is further divided into farmers and workers. \n- Contextual information: we introduced it three years back - questions at PU level - was the water level higher than last year, costs higher than last year, etc. \n- These three sheets help us answer reasons for some outlier \n\nSupport provided by the Better Cotton team to the WWF in the successful completion of the monitoring process\n- Dashboards are something that partners are using data quality - how much chemicals / pesticides they have used, income variation across seasons, \n- We are talking with partners regularly and the MEL team trying to collab with partners directly, understanding pain points from partners - RIR\n Are all the types of data collected and reported in a timely manner? If not, what are the reasons for delays? \n- no major delays from Partner (deadline is 3 months after the harvest) they report diligently - but when we get back with clarifications it takes time for them to revert. \n- Deadline for actual sharing of RIR - i have not seen any delays\n\nWhat are the steps taken to rectify errors found in data collection and entry?\n- Yield for alot of farmers is the same in a PU - sampled farmers say 200 -&amp;gt; 100 end up having the same yield. how can that be possible ? - they must be guesstimating - but sometimes there are genuine reasons as all farmers are close by - same climatic conditions, same pest attacks, etc. \n- Farmers usually know their land size in bigha and BC asks for land size in ha, so sometimes the numbers are lost in translation.\n- Farmers should be seeing sale receipts - small farmers dont have weighing machines - they dont know how much they have produced and sold. FFs should check the sale receipt. We are trying to put this in the minds of PUMs / FF\n\nWhat are the challenges encountered by the BC team when data is received from the ground (from partners/country or MEL team)? \n- Timeliness in terms of clarification is a big issue we face. The first set of data they give is timely but when we ask for clarification it takes alot of time and we are frozen. So we are very dependent on partners answers,\n- Unit conversion (from bigha to acres to ha as BC demand data in ha) difference in units compared with BC and what is followed region wise - is an issue , \n- Fertilizer - we ask them how much kilogram is used - but since they are small farmers, they report in ML - unit is a big issue. \nSonal deals with multiple countries so it is even more challenging as farm size categorisation is different across countries. \n\n\n Lot of changes have happened - because of COVID and methodology based changes \nTwo types of farmers - BC farmers + Lead farmers (every LG has one) \nBefore COVID - \n- we used to sample using 95% CI and 5% MoE - say there are 3500 farmers per PU - we used to ask for 500 to 600 farmers (can be between 350 to 600) - this includes all the lead farmers (100 to 125) + BC farmers \n- Methodology - 100 LGs for any PU - randomly select 10 LGs (country team selects) and pick up all farmers in that LG (35 farmers each LG) - 350 - remaining 90 LGs where lead farmers are selected. \n- Was it representative? Our unit of analysis - LG - LGs were formed to ensure smooth training purposes .. farmers were randomly selected but the lead farmers were not random - so you can say this was a flaw .. at one point we were comparing lead farmers with BC farmers.. We used to also compare BC farmers with comparison farmers of the same PU. \n- Despite all this we were not reporting on lead farmers outside.. (since it was not random sample).. We were reporting on BC farmers versus comparison farmers (non BC farmers) \nPost COVID \n- 95% , 10% - 200 farmers per PU - out of 200 = 100 lead farmers + 100 BC farmers - mandate to collect lead farmers did not change. \n- 100 BC / lead farmers Farmers - methodology - randomly selected 10 LGs out of which 9 BC farmers randomly selected each LG = 90 BC farmers + 1 Lead farmer from each LG from remaining LGs &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 200. \n- FFB - 5 farmers each LG since feedback received that a lot of time of FF going behind FFB. Therefore changed to support only 5 farmers per LG. \n- Before COVID all farmers under LG were selected later only few \n- Now I am more confident in the methodology, it is representative. (PURE) \n- Any suggestions: Lead farmer selection should have been scrapped - \n For rating of confidence in MEL results see Transcript\n\nMeans of Verification: MEL team is not well resourced to do those kind of verifications (Rating: ⅔) - lot of scope for improvement. \nCountry workshops are being held - better collabs with partners which will help us better connect with partners. \n MEL-BC Staff_26062024.docx NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Role of Robin Understanding of Supply Chain Process followed in BC Risks to credibility - segregation (BC vs non BC cotton) Process of Traceability Risks in traceability Demand supply situation in TN Challenges reported by Ginner or other staff Actual credible uptake meet the AAV for each PU Credibility challenges by value chain players Transcript Robin - Supply Chain - Robin has been working in BC for 2 and a half years as a _____ - within BC he is responsible for taking care of audits, reviewing reports, capacity building, etc. \n- He is working with the ginner to retailers and brands. \nFollowing are his main activities: \n- Capacity building - Ginner CB program in august and sept - CB takes place on Chain of Custody standards, which all suppliers (ginner to end manufacturer) need to comply with. \n- Monitoring and audits - His focus is on ginner part - answering their queries on the BC platform. - any queries like technical issues he provides support - Ginner &amp;gt; trader &amp;gt; spinner &amp;gt; yarn &amp;gt; fabric and then brands - it is not a one step process. \n- We do not give any costing on the BC portal. Since we are non - profits - it is the seller and buyers call. \n- Qty received is captured \n- Ginner captures the qty purchased on the BC platform - from xx PU we have procured this xx quantity, code name is specified, AV code, reference of procurement docs (suppose 100 slips involved in procurement from that PU - we need to mention the purchase slip number) \n- Once they put on the portal it enters into the BC supply chain. \n- Risks - we are representing 2-3k farmers through one AV code only. So on the portal we don&amp;#x27;t have mapping at farmer level, only at PU level. \n- If spinner not giving order to ginner for the procured BC cotton - \n- Say if spinner buys from ginner - then ginner will enter a sales transaction - they will specify buyer name, qty, invoice and other commercial invoices \n- Suppose if ginner is not able to sell BC and he sells it elsewhere - then does not appear in the BC value chain. \n- We are aware that all BC produced cotton will not enter our supply chain. \n- So therefore, in the portal we know only about qty sold and bought. No prices are mentioned.\n - We are not into certification, we don&amp;#x27;t give ginners any certificates. \n- Process - at the beginning of every cotton season - we start the onboarding training and every ginner has to go through it. We invite the old ginners plus new ones who have shown interest - training takes place full day. It is a mandatory process and if they dont attend they are not enrolled on the BC platform. Instead of a certificate you can say that we give them access to the BC platform. Every ginner will have a code. We don&amp;#x27;t charge anything from the ginner. \n- We onboard ginners in and around the PU villages, within a 50 to 100 km area. - basically near a farmer. \n- Time for transportation depends on distance between ginner and farmers \n- Demand for cotton has been very low since last year due to international scenario \nNo. of ginners working with BC: \n- Every year at the end of Aug every registration is null and void - every year we start from scratch - for the last 2-3 seasons 250 to 270 ginners have been working with us (all the PUs across India). In TN, we have 40 to 50 ginners. Lesser no. in TN as required - it is higher in MH, PB, etc.\n\nFarmers are free to sell with BC registered Ginner or outside, up to them. Factors like cost, immediate payment to farmers- influences farmers to choose ginner. - CoC specifies that ginners have to keep BC cotton separate from conventional cotton.\n- During the training we tell them ginners have to maintain separate heaps - some marking has to be there. \n- For quality purpose - we are not caring of the quality as that is commercial discussion - we care only about the segregation \n- How are you ensuring that ginner is segregating? / verification systems: We have an assurance program / third party audits for registered ginners- we have a specific sample - at least 30% of all India ginner verification takes place. \n- CoC is very comprehensive - we have third party assurance \n- Jammikunta ginner mentioned that he does not segregate the cotton - Robin’s reply - if ginner is not able to procure then he cannot list it on the portal. It is not mandatory for the ginner to supply through the portal. \n- We also visit ginners regularly. Ginners are active during the start of September and end in march. \n - Through sales and purchase docs - every Ginner has to have record at farmer level \n- Every farmer has a different code \n- Ginners have to maintain the following data - Mode of transportation, qty purchased, directly purchased or through middlemen (if middlemen all his info) \n- Transportation data is also captured - vehicle no., etc - supporting docs are also maintained - \npurchase slips (farmer details, etc.), \nquantity slip and \ntransportation doc if the transportation is done by the ginner. (there is no uniform transp method, sometimes middlemen collects from 10 farmers and sometimes ginner also sends transportation to farmer) \n- Are these docs sufficient as per you ? - The farmer to gin transaction is unorganized. For eg. B2BCI - limited docs from the actors, all dealings happen in cash, therefore the docs we ask for are sufficient. We are working on some pilots in this regard - but I am not part of it. \n- Risks - sometimes ginners cannot send two vehicles for BC and non BC - we mention in training that separate trucks have to be sent.. \n- We check the size of vehicles during our assessment and the quantity they bring there. Vehicle no. of all BC farmers we will check if the same. \n- We tell them not to mix BC and non BC - since quality is the utmost imp. \n- Purchase slips are also given to farmers \n- We check these slips during verification\n There are risks. \nNon BC farmers - sometimes in heap of BC cotton - conventional cotton is mixed.\n - Overall demand bit low since last two years \n- Since cotton is an export based community \n- With respect to TN, feedback received is that the quality of the cotton is low - length of the fiber, maturity of the fiber, gin outturn (suppose - I put 100 kg of seed cotton - how much lint and how much seed - out of 100 kg 37/36 kg lint cotton but in TN the recovery is lower. \n- We are getting feedback that a lot of cotton is being transported from TN to the neighboring states, where quality of cotton is better - middlemen doing this to optimize the costs. \n - Pricing - ginners are saying BC farmers are asking more cost even though we are not getting any profit here. Cotton prices are driven by the market \n- Esp in TN, ginner is saying we are not getting enough info on farmers. Gap between ginner and farmer - struggling in farmer identity. \n Uptake never as per AAV (always less) - not practical as well. We have no physical traceability - we are not claiming that the garment is of BC \nBut at the ginner side we have traceability \n2 types of CoC model - Physical and mass balance (mb) - from gin to upward actors it is physical and mb. \nAfter the ginner, we are having a system of BCCU (BC Claim Unit- 1 BCCU = 1 kg of lint cotton) . If 100 kg lint cotton is sold from ginner to spinner then 100 BCCU will appear in the spinner&amp;#x27;s account. That 100 BCCU can be used by spinner for any cotton. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is mb.\nThis mb points can be used by the spinner without selling the actual cotton \nIn mb there is a requirement of physical transaction then only points will be transferred to spinner account. \nDuring audits, we try to get the sense if points have been transferred without actual physical transfer - we track this. \nIn the physical method - cotton has to be segregated at all steps of VC - but there is a risk of mixing. This method we have introduced last year - we use both methods of mb and physical. \n Notes_Robin - supply chain NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Overview of the Better Cotton Assurance approach Roles and responsibilities of BC staff\n Compliance to credibility\n Sampling Level of confidence in assurance results Link to transcript NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Lalit Sharma Assurance approach (to understand if PUs are complying to BC standards or not - includes lists etc.) \n- It differs between the PU - licensing for old vs new \n- Partners conduct internal assessment of PU before BC licensing \n- Old PUs - assessment visit, license for three years, whenever it is getting expired BC will do it. \n- Surveillance assessment is for those who have an active license - incase there is any change in farmer participation or if there is any red flag raised in previous visits - then this assessment is conducted. \n- Assurance activities are mostly time bound \n- Assurance is an umbrella term - licensing is just a part of it. Even assessment comes under it like data verification, etc.\n\nAssessment process (Assurance is the umbrella term and assessment is a part of it)\n- There are principles and criteria in place which have some indicators in them\n- PUs have to comply to these principles \n- Assurance team comprises - 2 sets of assessors (BC + third party verifiers) - 4 organizations currently empanelled as TPV. People like lalit who do assessment - 4 to 5 people \n- PUs are intimated one week in advance - a template is shared with them which outlines the requirements. There are some docs also which are required to be submitted by PU before the assessment - we give them three days to give it to us.\n Role of Lalit : \n- He has joined BC 4 years ago and is working as Assurance Cooridnator &amp;gt;&amp;gt; he has a reporting manager \n- He is involved in - Assurance activities: \n- Data management (farmers list, adjusted figures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data) \n- Assurance activities calendar preparation (licensing, etc.) \n- Training of PUMs / FFs on various lists\n- Purpose of assurance - whether PUs are complying to standards or not. Within assurance we have different compliances (like list) + assessment conducted every three years. Assurance activities are defined set of requirement for eg. data - early season data, adjusted figures after one month of sowing, farm level data, self assessment, etc. \n- Before the start of the season we approach program partners to ask them about sowing dates, harvesting - based on these dates we decide the calendar activity for PUs \n- Lalit gets data in separate files as per INTL\nExpectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors: \n- Requirements to partners made clear \n- We plan our activities in advance so that partners are aware of when to submit \n- We also ensure that data from the field is of good quality - we thoroughly investigate it. \n- All communication from our end should be on time so that PCs have time to complete on time. \nRole of BC staff &amp;amp; TPV same - 3 day exercise \n- 1st day: opening meeting - PUs give introduction / PPT - interview with staff members, During this meeting, they also inform the villages that the team will be visiting the next day\n- 2nd day: 2 LGs are covered - 5 farmers from each LG minimum - farmers + workers are interviewed. On this day we tell them about the next day&amp;#x27;s villages. \n- 3rd day: Morning - 1 LG - 5 farmers meeting - Post lunch: closing remarks / meeting. We dont give any recommendations or idea of how the PU is doing - all that goes in the report. \n- After this - we make a report and submit it to the India Assurance Team and also to the global assurance team. Licensing is in their hands. \n- BC staff and TPV visits separately to separate PUs - we have a ratio of 60:40 - 60% assessment will be done by TPV and 40% by BC. \n- Assessment process same as above \n- There is flexibility in conducting the interviews - more than 3 LGs can also be interviewed - minimum is 3 \n- TPV also has to submit a report to India Assurance Team\nSupport provided by BC to TPV and WWF \n- CS vertical - Relationship management team - in touch with WWF Telangana - we provide the standard protocol to the partners - it is up to them how they want to design the meetings / training calendar -they just have to comply with the principles. Incase PC wants any clarification or want to access a knowledge partner then BC conducts TOT. \n- We have separate templates for different data sets - we train the PUMs and PCs on how to fill this template - since RIR is technical. \n Integrity of Data: \n- Earlier we had encountered the issue of fake farmers - when we receive the list of farmers from PU we cross check by calling a few farmers and asking them if they know they are a part of the BC program. \n- We have details of PU Staff - who are responsible for particular LGs - we call at least 5-10 farmers under each FF (non lead farmers since they are reliable) \n- Random selection of 5-10 farmers - we used to ask their names, father names, whether they know BC program \n- Right now they dont do this calling exercise - we have told partners that we can do this cross check anytime \n- Processes followed currently - whenever they receive a file they look from quality POV - correct format, units, duplication, etc. \n- For different data sets we have different cleaning exercises. For eg. RIR is checked by the global team. We just glance and check for basic things and follow the global team - they do a deep dive \nFactors considered for credibility in assessment process \n- Process are designed in a way that is impartial \n- It is recommended to assessors not to give suggestions to PUs during their visits \n- Anti bribery policy - no gifts to be considered from PUs \nRisks considered \n- When we used to inform PU about the assessment dates they used to revert saying there is xx festival - so we have asked partners to share dates with us \n- Recently 1 PU told us that there is some staffing issue and all the FFs had got terminated so they asked for time extension - sometimes even PUM not well etc. - so if particular staff is not available we assess how crucial they are for our assessment - if not very crucial then we are ok and continue with the assessment \n- Weather issues - farmers are not in mood to talk when weather is not good \nEfficiency in assurance process \n- Approach is good enough \n- We have an arm for CS also which is unique to BC \n- We have a whole picture in the three day assessment - at the end of the day we want to understand the impact \n- We only talk to 15 farmers but this is good to get an idea - as general practices are same across LGs \nFactors contributing to non compliance from farmers \n- Adoption of PPE kit - we want farmers to use them but weather conditions are such they dont wear \n- Sometimes extension agents (pesticide vendors) tell farmers to mix chemicals \n- Certain chemicals BC bans but it is cheap and easily available to farmers so they opt for it (for eg. monocrotophos) \n- We have run campaigns to discourage such behavior\nHow do the existing assurance systems and processes work to mitigate the risks/ influence associated with free riders and non-BC farmers?\nThis will remain a challenge - we dont have details of ALL farmers since we dont have resources for that. Even in the PURE we cant say there wont be free riders \n\n\n - In the limited time we have (3 days) - 15 farmers is fair - but we also do FGDs to cross check \n- Sample size is fixed for us - 15 - random sampling \n- We also talk to local resources - pesticides shop owner, sarpanch, etc. \n- Therefore , 15 farmers + FGDs + local resources is good enough \n- We are well versed on how to talk to farmers and we are also well versed with the geography - makes our job easier \n- He feels the sample size is representative - sampling is done on our own as in the LG selection is on us. We do it on following factors - based on rain fed farmers, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, response of FF in opening meeting \n- Selection bias prevention - Assessors select the LGs \n- Respondent bias prevention - we are as objective as possible \n- Scope of the assessment (duration and sample) limit the assessors’ ability \nIn case we feel that three LGs is not enough or if something is inconclusive - we are free to consider 4 or 5 LGs \n- Challenges in assurance process \n- Nothing as such - just the risks i mentioned above\n- Remote locations - traveling becomes too far - even between LG farmers \n - Means of verification used to validate/triangulate the findings - FGDs + local resource information\n- For rating of level of confidence please see detailed transcript Notes_Assurance_BC Staff_Lalit NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Yunus - Third Party Verifier Dhanish) NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN --- Sheet: KPI 6 --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 Stakeholders for KPI 6 : Program farmers (M) , Lead farmers Unnamed: 3 Unnamed: 4 Unnamed: 5 Unnamed: 6 Unnamed: 7 Unnamed: 8 Unnamed: 9 Unnamed: 10 Unnamed: 11 Unnamed: 12 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN BC Program Farmers (Male) NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Overview - journey experience Farmers on trainings / effectiveness Impact of the BC Program Support from family / spouse Farmer income On caste distribution in village Suggestions Transcript NaN NaN NaN NaN Aarepally (INTL 01) - The farmers have been a part of BC from 6 years \n- All the cotton farmers in this GP are BC farmers = Out of 200 farmers in GP / 150 growing cotton (others grow rice), out of 150 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 130 are BC farmers, within which there are only 2-3 women farmers (they joined because their husbands died recently). The women participate in training, etc. \n- Average land size of farmers = 2 to 5 acres (max: 10 acres) Farmers with less agri land take land on lease \n- Non-program farmers have a particular mindset and they don&amp;#x27;t want to join ANY program\n- Earlier farmers used to end up investing higher amounts and used to get less yield. Now their investments have decreased and are getting better yield - they now use organic fertilizers and cow / buffalo dung. \n- Previously, when Mr. Raghuveera Reddy was the Agricultural Minister of the former Andhra Pradesh state, he provided a subsidy on fertilizers. The original cost of a bag of seed was Rs. 1,750, but with the subsidy, they were able to purchase it for Rs. 750.\n - Farmers like AVs and find it helpful : They feel that videos are the best medium for learning \n- FFs conduct training as per farmer convenience (morning 7AM to 9AM) \n- Farmers who joined the BC program late - joined by seeing the progress of BC farmers - less pesticides, rallies, AVs, etc. \n- Farmers fill FFB diligently, they like it and feel it is useful. For illiterate farmers, FF helps + also farmers children \n- When asked on the challenges, farmers said they haven&amp;#x27;t faced any issue. \n- Due to the rallies, co farmers and other non program farmers too have become keen on being part of BC \n- The FF- Sony - does regular follow up with BCI farmers through farm visits, home visits. Farmers also call her up and ask doubts. \n- Women also participate in rallies, though about 10% of female farmers are unable to attend. Not all women gather on a single platform; instead, they split into different groups based on their areas and attend various meetings. The 10 women farmers who missed the rallies will be reached through Self Help Group meetings and FF does home visits.\n - Previously, they were using Monocrotophos and spending a significant amount on pesticides, often following a cocktail of chemicals, but with very poor crop yields. However, thanks to the guidance from Ms. Sony and the field staff, they learned not to use harmful pesticides or chemical mixtures. \n- As a result, their costs have decreased, and our crop yields have significantly improved, leading to better prices in the market. In the past, farmers were incurring losses, but now, with the regular support and information from Ms. Damayanthi and Ms. Sony, they have conducted soil tests, \n- We also started planting intercropped green grams and black grams, and began using domestically produced organic fertilizers, such as those made from neem trees.\n- Previously, no one guided us on these practices. Now, due to the impact of field visits and meetings, they are using fewer pesticides, cultivating intercropped crops, and protecting our health.\n- They face menace from Monkeys - monkeys target crops like Tomato and Brinjal - making it difficult for the farmers to do intercropping \n- Farmers told that their quality of life has increased after becoming part of BC - purchased chairs at home, educated their children, converted their Kaccha houses to Pakka houses \n- They get Rs. 20k profit per acre per season \n - BC farmers mentioned that their wives also help in farming \n- They do not take help from children as it affects their education. The farmers also said that it is risk to take them to field as if a snake bit or scorpion bite happens then they cant identify it and it can become fatal \n - The average income from one acre of land - Rs. 20,000 - 6 months and if two crops then Rs. 40,000 (12 months) All families in the village belonged to backward class. There is only one upper caste in the village and they are not into farming. \nHowever, there is no community system now and we dont differentiate between religions. \n Subsidies for PPE kits, drip and sprinkler irrigation, charger pump and sprayer. \n Combined_M_program farmers - Aarepally NaN NaN NaN NaN Chityalapally (INTL 23) The farmers have been cultivating different crops including Maize, grams etc since 30+years but have transitioned to cultivating cotton from the last 12 years. The BC program have been operating in the area since 6 years.\nLead Farmer - Mallesh, has been involved for many years.\nThe farmers carry their cotton to the market yard, where they receive a higher price compared to selling to private agents. But some of the farmers transacts with private agents even as the transport responsibility and expenses are taken care by them.\n Theres a 50% attendance ratio for trainings.\nTrainings cover topics including the proper use of fertilizers, soil testing, the importance of wearing PPE kits, and avoiding harmful pesticides .\nSome farmers do not consistently use PPE kits, leading to health issues. \nFFB is not maintained by and large, although a very few is said to have noting down the important expenses.\nAudio and video demonstrations by private companies are demonstrated on the use of their products. Reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals and increased adoption of safer practices like using green color pesticides instead of red .\nMachinery usage has increased, reducing the need for manual labor. This includes the use of tractors, harvesting machines, and even cotton-removing machines .\nThe shift from cotton to paddy is noted due to the lower labor requirements for paddy and improved water resources . Female farmers rarely attend the meetings due to their domestic and agricultural responsibilities\nDecision-making within families is predominantly done by male farmers, though feedback from educated females is sometimes accepted - BC trainings has helped the female farmers in gaining the knowledge and hence, better decision making roles (&amp;quot;If the females are educated, we will accept female feedback&amp;quot;) Income Generated: Rs. 7000 per quintal, with yields of 10-12 quintals per acre . They also earn income from intercropping with maize, green grams, and groundnut .\n\nThe use of private markets and government market yards affects their earnings, with government yards offering higher prices but involving more effort in transportation .\n No major role was discussed on Caste operations - though all of them were from OCs Farmers suggest that the duration of meetings should be reduced to 45 minutes, as the current one-hour meetings are considered too long .\nThere is a need for free PPE kits, as the cost of Rs. 1000 per kit is burdensome for farmers. \nThey also requested fixed prices for pesticides and fertilizers across outlets to avoid losses .\nFarmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training tools and better safety materials .\nThere is a general satisfaction with the BCI program, but they pointed out that some farmers still do not follow all recommended practices, such as wearing PPE kits .

On the first day, he waters rows 1 and 3. On the second day, he waters rows 2 and 4) \n- What he learns from the Farmer Facilitator (FF), he shares with the field farmers. FF has taught him about intercropping with red gram and green gram, usage of PPE Kits, and border crops. \n - He became the lead farmer because he was more educated compared to other farmers in the village. \n- He also said that initially investments were high with pesticides and fertilizers, now after becoming part of BC his investments have reduced and he wants to educate the other farmers too.\n - He said that he is not aware of demos, rallies, exposure visits, etc. Since this village recently came under the fold of BCI - they have planned for rallies, demos, etc. after July 15 2024. He said that few trainings have been conducted \n- Srikant also mentioned that other farmers listen to him and few farmers who cannot attend trainings come for other trainings which are held at their convenient timings. \n - Srikant maintains FFB and fills it on the same day. He helps other farmers fill in too. \n- He said he likes filling FFB, he does not face any challenges and also feels that it is important. \n- When asked about how maintaining FFB helped him - he said it helps them track their income, expenditure, profit and loss. - FF told farmers in training about cotton storage - no dust, no water contact, etc. \n- Srikant preserves the cotton in a clean, dry place by following proper precautions. He ensures the cotton is free of dust by tying it in cloth and avoiding exposure to water and humidity. Additionally, he dries the cotton thoroughly and stores it in good-quality bags to maintain its condition.\n- Srikant has 18 quintals of cotton which he has stored for the past one year - the day this interview was held he had sent out 8 quintals of cotton for sale at Rs. 12,000 per quintal. He was waiting for the prices to increase. One ginner (market yard commission agent) approached Srikant and gave him cash and receipt and took his cotton. \n- The commission agent will take 1.5% commission if farmer wants immediate cash but if farmer is ok with receiving money after 15 days then no commission is levied.\n- For transportation, most of the farmers use truck (rented) - expense is around Rs. 1,200\n- Price of cotton depends on its quality. \n - Srikant talks to other non-BC farmers about BC but only to those who are near him \n- He also said that other farmers are reluctant to join BC because they feel they will have to attend lot of trainings and do documentation \n- Farmers discuss practices amongst themselves\n - He said that post BC, yield per acre has increased. Before also yield was good , the difference post BC has been that first he used to grow only cotton throughout the year - now he grows cotton and maize and yellow gram as a border crop. \n- Crop yield increased per acre\n Subsidy for seeds, new agricultural methods, labor problem is there, therefore machinery equipment to cut cotton flowers. - 20 laborers working on his farm - Female Rs 500 per day and male Rs. 800 to 1000 per day because they do more laborious work. During the season the rates may be higher. \n- Male farmers are usually involved in laborious work while women are involved in weeding and cotton plucking. - Srikant said that avoidance of pesticides has benefitted them as quality of cotton has increased and investment has reduced.\n- In his initial months, Srikant used to motivate non-BCI farmers to join the the BC program. \n- Srikant himself wears a scarf to cover his head but he does not wear shoes because the land is very marshy.\n- Srinkant buys seeds from private fertilizer shops - Sidda and Randhir - Rs. 750 to 800 for 450 gms which suffices for 0.5 acres of land. He also said WWF provides with navadhanya to promote regenerative agriculture \n- Srikant doesn&amp;#x27;t want his children to do farming. He said when he was young he started farming and could not study further. \n- Youth of the village get either private or govt. Jobs with a minimum 10,000 salary. \n\n Combined_Lead farmer_srikant Ramesh (INTL 23) Ramesh has been associated with BC since 6 years &amp;amp; has 40 farmers under him, only 2 to 3 are women. Ramesh was selected to become the lead farmer by KVK. - Conducting trainings, solving problems faced by farmers\n- He gives official training to farmers once a month, if need be then more than once. But on an informal basis, Ramesh meets farmers everyday - they call him up and ask him for suggestions / advice \n- Topics covered - Intercropping (with red gram &amp;amp; yellow gram), no usage of pesticides, use of organic methods, precautions while spraying pesticides, etc. \nRamesh educates farmers on using pheromone traps, and the importance of wearing safety gloves and masks during spraying. The farmers follow his recommendations because he promotes good practices and suggests using effective medicines. As a result, the farmers end up adopting the practices.\n\n\n He said that he feels everyone should benefit from good / best farming practices. He believes that if he educates other farmers then their crop yield will be higher and costs will be lower. \n - Most impactful aspect of training: Rallies have been conducted in the village, AVs have not been shown but he said that the distribution of pamphlets and putting Flexis during training proves to be very useful to the farmers. \n- Ramesh mentioned that non BC and non cotton growing farmers (paddy farmers) also participate in the meetings \n- Ramesh also believes that the duty of restoring the damage done to the environment is in our hands and therefore we should only fix it. Ramesh being the lead farmer maintains the FFB by writing all farm expenditures in it. Even the other farmers like maintaining the FFB as they feel it helps them capture / record everything. NaN - Non BC farmers (growing maize, gram, etc.) also participate in the training and have shown interest in becoming part of the program. \n- Ramesh mentioned that farmers talk about agri practices as and when they meet - be it on the road, fertilizer shops or temples. \n- While some farmers are cooperative, there are some larger farmers who may not always listen. However, it was announced to all the cotton farmers that everyone would attend a meeting where cotton would be harvested as a competition. \n Yields have increased plus we are now able to do intercropping of pulses. We use these pulses at home for meals which saves us on the cost of buying from the market. \n NaN - 50% of the village women farmers help in farming - providing water, planting seeds, removing weeds, plucking and helping in pesticide spraying \n- Men do tasks like ploughing and spraying pesticides - basically heavy physical work \n Challenges: \n- Biggest problem is the pink bollworm which affects the quality of the cotton. Usage of pheromone traps has reduced the problem only a little. No medicine is available in the market against bollworm. \n- Fluctuating cotton prices are an issue \n- Govt. gives seeds of red gram and green gram free of cost - they haven&amp;#x27;t given it this time \n Combined_Lead farmer_Ramesh --- Sheet: KPI 6.1_prog farmers --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 Unnamed: 2 NaN NaN NaN Participant Aarepally (INTL 01) Chityalapally (INTL 23) Overview - journey experience - The farmers have been a part of BC from 6 years \n- All the cotton farmers in this GP are BC farmers = Out of 200 farmers in GP / 150 growing cotton (others grow rice), out of 150 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 130 are BC farmers, within which there are only 2-3 women farmers (they joined because their husbands died recently). The women participate in training, etc. \n- Average land size of farmers = 2 to 5 acres (max: 10 acres) Farmers with less agri land take land on lease \n- Non-program farmers have a particular mindset and they don&amp;#x27;t want to join ANY program\n- Earlier farmers used to end up investing higher amounts and used to get less yield. Now their investments have decreased and are getting better yield - they now use organic fertilizers and cow / buffalo dung. \n- Previously, when Mr. Raghuveera Reddy was the Agricultural Minister of the former Andhra Pradesh state, he provided a subsidy on fertilizers. The original cost of a bag of seed was Rs. 1,750, but with the subsidy, they were able to purchase it for Rs. 750.\n The farmers have been cultivating different crops including Maize, grams etc since 30+years but have transitioned to cultivating cotton from the last 12 years. The BC program have been operating in the area since 6 years.\nLead Farmer - Mallesh, has been involved for many years.\nThe farmers carry their cotton to the market yard, where they receive a higher price compared to selling to private agents. But some of the farmers transacts with private agents even as the transport responsibility and expenses are taken care by them.\n Farmers on trainings / effectiveness - Farmers like AVs and find it helpful : They feel that videos are the best medium for learning \n- FFs conduct training as per farmer convenience (morning 7AM to 9AM) \n- Farmers who joined the BC program late - joined by seeing the progress of BC farmers - less pesticides, rallies, AVs, etc. \n- Farmers fill FFB diligently, they like it and feel it is useful. For illiterate farmers, FF helps + also farmers children \n- When asked on the challenges, farmers said they haven&amp;#x27;t faced any issue. \n- Due to the rallies, co farmers and other non program farmers too have become keen on being part of BC \n- The FF- Sony - does regular follow up with BCI farmers through farm visits, home visits. Farmers also call her up and ask doubts. \n- Women also participate in rallies, though about 10% of female farmers are unable to attend. Not all women gather on a single platform; instead, they split into different groups based on their areas and attend various meetings. The 10 women farmers who missed the rallies will be reached through Self Help Group meetings and FF does home visits.\n Theres a 50% attendance ratio for trainings.\nTrainings cover topics including the proper use of fertilizers, soil testing, the importance of wearing PPE kits, and avoiding harmful pesticides .\nSome farmers do not consistently use PPE kits, leading to health issues. \nFFB is not maintained by and large, although a very few is said to have noting down the important expenses.\nAudio and video demonstrations by private companies are demonstrated on the use of their products. Impact of the BC Program - Previously, they were using Monocrotophos and spending a significant amount on pesticides, often following a cocktail of chemicals, but with very poor crop yields. However, thanks to the guidance from Ms. Sony and the field staff, they learned not to use harmful pesticides or chemical mixtures. \n- As a result, their costs have decreased, and our crop yields have significantly improved, leading to better prices in the market. In the past, farmers were incurring losses, but now, with the regular support and information from Ms. Damayanthi and Ms. Sony, they have conducted soil tests, \n- We also started planting intercropped green grams and black grams, and began using domestically produced organic fertilizers, such as those made from neem trees.\n- Previously, no one guided us on these practices. Now, due to the impact of field visits and meetings, they are using fewer pesticides, cultivating intercropped crops, and protecting our health.\n- They face menace from Monkeys - monkeys target crops like Tomato and Brinjal - making it difficult for the farmers to do intercropping \n- Farmers told that their quality of life has increased after becoming part of BC - purchased chairs at home, educated their children, converted their Kaccha houses to Pakka houses \n- They get Rs. 20k profit per acre per season \n Reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals and increased adoption of safer practices like using green color pesticides instead of red .\nMachinery usage has increased, reducing the need for manual labor. This includes the use of tractors, harvesting machines, and even cotton-removing machines .\nThe shift from cotton to paddy is noted due to the lower labor requirements for paddy and improved water resources . Support from family / spouse - BC farmers mentioned that their wives also help in farming \n- They do not take help from children as it affects their education. The farmers also said that it is risk to take them to field as if a snake bit or scorpion bite happens then they cant identify it and it can become fatal \n Female farmers rarely attend the meetings due to their domestic and agricultural responsibilities\nDecision-making within families is predominantly done by male farmers, though feedback from educated females is sometimes accepted - BC trainings has helped the female farmers in gaining the knowledge and hence, better decision making roles (&amp;quot;If the females are educated, we will accept female feedback&amp;quot;) Farmer income - The average income from one acre of land - Rs. 20,000 - 6 months and if two crops then Rs. 40,000 (12 months) Income Generated: Rs. 7000 per quintal, with yields of 10-12 quintals per acre . They also earn income from intercropping with maize, green grams, and groundnut .\n\nThe use of private markets and government market yards affects their earnings, with government yards offering higher prices but involving more effort in transportation .\n On caste distribution in village All families in the village belonged to backward class. There is only one upper caste in the village and they are not into farming. \nHowever, there is no community system now and we dont differentiate between religions. \n No major role was discussed on Caste operations - though all of them were from OCs Suggestions Subsidies for PPE kits, drip and sprinkler irrigation, charger pump and sprayer. \n Farmers suggest that the duration of meetings should be reduced to 45 minutes, as the current one-hour meetings are considered too long .\nThere is a need for free PPE kits, as the cost of Rs. 1000 per kit is burdensome for farmers. \nThey also requested fixed prices for pesticides and fertilizers across outlets to avoid losses .\nFarmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training tools and better safety materials .\nThere is a general satisfaction with the BCI program, but they pointed out that some farmers still do not follow all recommended practices, such as wearing PPE kits . --- Sheet: KPI 6.2_lead farmers --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 Unnamed: 2 Participant Srikant (INTL 02) Ramesh (INTL 23) Overview - He has been with BC from 2 years and has been the lead farmer since 1 ½ years \n- He owns 2.5 acres of land \n- 15 farmers under him , 200 cotton farmers in the village\n- In the village, maximum 5 acres of land and minimum 1 acre of land. \n- Cotton and paddy are the most grown crops in his village, other crop: chilly and maize. \n Ramesh has been associated with BC since 6 years &amp;amp; has 40 farmers under him, only 2 to 3 are women. Ramesh was selected to become the lead farmer by KVK. Responsibilities - Educating farmers on bio pesticides (green, blue), stem applications, usage of PPE kits, intercropping, pest management, border crops. \n- Srikant explains to his fellow farmers the following things - \n- The use of certain pesticides led to losses, so he explained the system to others, emphasizing the importance of using only green and blue pesticides. \n- He advised against using Monocrotophos. \n- He is educating farmers about precautions related to water resources, promoting the use of bio-fertilizers, and advising them to avoid harmful pesticides. \n- He also taught farmers a crop watering method - it involves watering alternate rows of plants (There are four plant rows: 1, 2, 3, and 4. On the first day, he waters rows 1 and 3. On the second day, he waters rows 2 and 4) \n- What he learns from the Farmer Facilitator (FF), he shares with the field farmers. FF has taught him about intercropping with red gram and green gram, usage of PPE Kits, and border crops. \n - Conducting trainings, solving problems faced by farmers\n- He gives official training to farmers once a month, if need be then more than once. But on an informal basis, Ramesh meets farmers everyday - they call him up and ask him for suggestions / advice \n- Topics covered - Intercropping (with red gram &amp;amp; yellow gram), no usage of pesticides, use of organic methods, precautions while spraying pesticides, etc. \nRamesh educates farmers on using pheromone traps, and the importance of wearing safety gloves and masks during spraying. The farmers follow his recommendations because he promotes good practices and suggests using effective medicines. As a result, the farmers end up adopting the practices.\n\n\n Reason / motivation for working as Lead farmer - He became the lead farmer because he was more educated compared to other farmers in the village. \n- He also said that initially investments were high with pesticides and fertilizers, now after becoming part of BC his investments have reduced and he wants to educate the other farmers too.\n He said that he feels everyone should benefit from good / best farming practices. He believes that if he educates other farmers then their crop yield will be higher and costs will be lower. \n Impact of Trainings, rallies, demos, etc - He said that he is not aware of demos, rallies, exposure visits, etc. Since this village recently came under the fold of BCI - they have planned for rallies, demos, etc. after July 15 2024. He said that few trainings have been conducted \n- Srikant also mentioned that other farmers listen to him and few farmers who cannot attend trainings come for other trainings which are held at their convenient timings. \n - Most impactful aspect of training: Rallies have been conducted in the village, AVs have not been shown but he said that the distribution of pamphlets and putting Flexis during training proves to be very useful to the farmers. \n- Ramesh mentioned that non BC and non cotton growing farmers (paddy farmers) also participate in the meetings \n- Ramesh also believes that the duty of restoring the damage done to the environment is in our hands and therefore we should only fix it. About FFB - Srikant maintains FFB and fills it on the same day. He helps other farmers fill in too. \n- He said he likes filling FFB, he does not face any challenges and also feels that it is important. \n- When asked about how maintaining FFB helped him - he said it helps them track their income, expenditure, profit and loss. Ramesh being the lead farmer maintains the FFB by writing all farm expenditures in it. Even the other farmers like maintaining the FFB as they feel it helps them capture / record everything. Cotton Storage &amp;amp; Cotton prices - FF told farmers in training about cotton storage - no dust, no water contact, etc. \n- Srikant preserves the cotton in a clean, dry place by following proper precautions. He ensures the cotton is free of dust by tying it in cloth and avoiding exposure to water and humidity. Additionally, he dries the cotton thoroughly and stores it in good-quality bags to maintain its condition.\n- Srikant has 18 quintals of cotton which he has stored for the past one year - the day this interview was held he had sent out 8 quintals of cotton for sale at Rs. 12,000 per quintal. He was waiting for the prices to increase. One ginner (market yard commission agent) approached Srikant and gave him cash and receipt and took his cotton. \n- The commission agent will take 1.5% commission if farmer wants immediate cash but if farmer is ok with receiving money after 15 days then no commission is levied.\n- For transportation, most of the farmers use truck (rented) - expense is around Rs. 1,200\n- Price of cotton depends on its quality. \n NaN Social cohesion and collaboration amongst farmers - Srikant talks to other non-BC farmers about BC but only to those who are near him \n- He also said that other farmers are reluctant to join BC because they feel they will have to attend lot of trainings and do documentation \n- Farmers discuss practices amongst themselves\n - Non BC farmers (growing maize, gram, etc.) also participate in the training and have shown interest in becoming part of the program. \n- Ramesh mentioned that farmers talk about agri practices as and when they meet - be it on the road, fertilizer shops or temples. \n- While some farmers are cooperative, there are some larger farmers who may not always listen. However, it was announced to all the cotton farmers that everyone would attend a meeting where cotton would be harvested as a competition. \n Benefits from joining BC program - He said that post BC, yield per acre has increased. Before also yield was good , the difference post BC has been that first he used to grow only cotton throughout the year - now he grows cotton and maize and yellow gram as a border crop. \n- Crop yield increased per acre\n Yields have increased plus we are now able to do intercropping of pulses. We use these pulses at home for meals which saves us on the cost of buying from the market. \n Expectations from BC Subsidy for seeds, new agricultural methods, labor problem is there, therefore machinery equipment to cut cotton flowers. NaN Role on men / women on farms - 20 laborers working on his farm - Female Rs 500 per day and male Rs. 800 to 1000 per day because they do more laborious work. During the season the rates may be higher. \n- Male farmers are usually involved in laborious work while women are involved in weeding and cotton plucking. - 50% of the village women farmers help in farming - providing water, planting seeds, removing weeds, plucking and helping in pesticide spraying \n- Men do tasks like ploughing and spraying pesticides - basically heavy physical work \n Other comments - Srikant said that avoidance of pesticides has benefitted them as quality of cotton has increased and investment has reduced.\n- In his initial months, Srikant used to motivate non-BCI farmers to join the the BC program. \n- Srikant himself wears a scarf to cover his head but he does not wear shoes because the land is very marshy.\n- Srinkant buys seeds from private fertilizer shops - Sidda and Randhir - Rs. 750 to 800 for 450 gms which suffices for 0.5 acres of land. He also said WWF provides with navadhanya to promote regenerative agriculture \n- Srikant doesn&amp;#x27;t want his children to do farming. He said when he was young he started farming and could not study further. \n- Youth of the village get either private or govt. Jobs with a minimum 10,000 salary. \n\n Challenges: \n- Biggest problem is the pink bollworm which affects the quality of the cotton. Usage of pheromone traps has reduced the problem only a little. No medicine is available in the market against bollworm. \n- Fluctuating cotton prices are an issue \n- Govt. gives seeds of red gram and green gram free of cost - they haven&amp;#x27;t given it this time \n --- Sheet: KPI 7 --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 Stakeholders for KPI 7 : Ginner, BC Staff (Robin, Lalit, Sonal) Unnamed: 3 Unnamed: 4 Unnamed: 5 Unnamed: 6 Unnamed: 7 Unnamed: 8 Unnamed: 9 Unnamed: 10 Unnamed: 11 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Ginner NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Role of Ginner Procurement of Cotton Mitigation of Risks to Credibility Supply of Processed Cotton NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Ginner - Narayanan Mukka - Jammikunta Operates in Jammikunta and has been in the cotton industry since 1997, started Ginning operations in 2002.\nThe ginning process involves unloading cotton, heating it for 24 hours, ginning (cleaning and separating fibers), and pressing into bales.\nGinners work with private spinning mills, mainly in Chennai and emerging markets like Gundoor in Telangana.\nGinning Mills in Jammikonda process approximately 1500 quintals of cotton per day.\nGinners have noticed that conventional and BC (Better Cotton ) cotton cannot be differentiated, and BCI certification is seen more as a negotiation tool. Farmers participate in two ways: through the Government Market Yard (6 AM to 9 AM) or by bringing cotton directly to the ginner for mutual negotiation based on quality.\nThe average rate for cotton is 7500-7600 INR per 100 kg, with the highest this year being 7800 INR.\nCotton quality is tested after procurement, focusing on stability and micronaire.\nCotton is usually sold by farmers according to their convenience and financial needs rather than optimal storage or timing, leading to quality degradation with prolonged storage. Farmers face challenges in cotton marketing and storage, as fiber quality decreases after 6-8 months of storage.\nThe Technology Mission of Cotton and mechanization (since 2008) have improved the ginning process, but issues like lack of farmer collectivization and the inefficacy of e-marketing platforms like GeM persist.\nBCI certification isn’t widely adopted by farmers due to a lack of perceived necessity, though it could encourage better practices if more farmers were educated on its benefits. Cotton is processed and then sold to private spinning mills, with no distinct identification mechanisms for cotton grown with chemicals or organically.\nBidding for cotton typically occurs through open tender, and quality remains 80% uniform for a specific delivery.\nThe yield per acre ranges from a minimum of 6 quintals to a maximum of 15 quintals, with the best quality cotton available from January to March, just before summer.

Since we are non - profits - it is the seller and buyers call. \n- Qty received is captured \n- Ginner captures the qty purchased on the BC platform - from xx PU we have procured this xx quantity, code name is specified, AV (Annual Authorised Volume) code, reference of procurement docs (suppose 100 slips involved in procurement from that PU - we need to mention the purchase slip number) \n- Once they put on the portal it enters into the BC supply chain. \n- Risks - we are representing 2-3k farmers through one AV code only. So on the portal we don&amp;#x27;t have mapping at farmer level, only at PU level. \n- If spinner not giving order to ginner for the procured BC cotton - \n- Say if spinner buys from ginner - then ginner will enter a sales transaction - they will specify buyer name, qty, invoice and other commercial invoices \n- Suppose if ginner is not able to sell BC and he sells it elsewhere - then does not appear in the BC value chain. \n- We are aware that all BC produced cotton will not enter our supply chain. \n- So therefore, in the portal we know only about qty sold and bought. No prices are mentioned.\n - We are not into certification, we don&amp;#x27;t give ginners any certificates. \n- Process - at the beginning of every cotton season - we start the onboarding training and every ginner has to go through it. We invite the old ginners plus new ones who have shown interest - training takes place full day. It is a mandatory process and if they dont attend they are not enrolled on the BC platform. Instead of a certificate you can say that we give them access to the BC platform. Every ginner will have a code. We don&amp;#x27;t charge anything from the ginner. \n- We onboard ginners in and around the PU villages, within a 50 to 100 km area. - basically near a farmer. \n- Time for transportation depends on distance between ginner and farmers \n- Demand for cotton has been very low since last year due to international scenario \nNo. of ginners working with BC: \n- Every year at the end of Aug every registration is null and void - every year we start from scratch - for the last 2-3 seasons 250 to 270 ginners have been working with us (all the PUs across India). In TN, we have 40 to 50 ginners. Lesser no. in TN as required - it is higher in MH, PB, etc.\n\nFarmers are free to sell with BC registered Ginner or outside, up to them. Factors like cost, immediate payment to farmers- influences farmers to choose ginner. - CoC specifies that ginners have to keep BC cotton separate from conventional cotton.\n- During the training we tell them ginners have to maintain separate heaps - some marking has to be there. \n- For quality purpose - we are not caring of the quality as that is commercial discussion - we care only about the segregation \n- How are you ensuring that ginner is segregating? / verification systems: We have an assurance program / third party audits for registered ginners- we have a specific sample - at least 30% of all India ginner verification takes place. \n- CoC is very comprehensive - we have third party assurance \n- Jammikunta ginner mentioned that he does not segregate the cotton - Robin’s reply - if ginner is not able to procure then he cannot list it on the portal. It is not mandatory for the ginner to supply through the portal. \n- We also visit ginners regularly. Ginners are active during the start of September and end in march. - Through sales and purchase docs - every Ginner has to have record at farmer level \n- Every farmer has a different code \n- Ginners have to maintain the following data - Mode of transportation, qty purchased, directly purchased or through middlemen (if middlemen all his info) \n- Transportation data is also captured - vehicle no., etc - supporting docs are also maintained - \npurchase slips (farmer details, etc.), \nquantity slip and \ntransportation doc if the transportation is done by the ginner. (there is no uniform transp method, sometimes middlemen collects from 10 farmers and sometimes ginner also sends transportation to farmer) \n- Are these docs sufficient as per you ? - The farmer to gin transaction is unorganized. For eg. B2BCI - limited docs from the actors, all dealings happen in cash, therefore the docs we ask for are sufficient. We are working on some pilots in this regard - but I am not part of it. \n- Risks - sometimes ginners cannot send two vehicles for BC and non BC - we mention in training that separate trucks have to be sent.. \n- We check the size of vehicles during our assessment and the quantity they bring there. Vehicle no. of all BC farmers we will check if the same. \n- We tell them not to mix BC and non BC - since quality is the utmost imp. \n- Purchase slips are also given to farmers \n- We check these slips during verification\n There are risks. \nNon BC farmers - sometimes in heap of BC cotton - conventional cotton is mixed.\n - Overall demand bit low since last two years \n- Since cotton is an export based commodity\n- With respect to TN, feedback received is that the quality of the cotton is low - length of the fiber, maturity of the fiber, gin outturn (suppose - I put 100 kg of seed cotton - how much lint and how much seed - out of 100 kg 37/36 kg lint cotton but in TN the recovery is lower. \n- We are getting feedback that a lot of cotton is being transported from TN to the neighboring states, where quality of cotton is better - middlemen doing this to optimize the costs. \n - Pricing - ginners are saying BC farmers are asking more cost even though we are not getting any profit here. Cotton prices are driven by the market \n- Esp in TN, ginner is saying we are not getting enough info on farmers. Gap between ginner and farmer - struggling in farmer identity. \n Uptake never as per AAV (always less) - not practical as well. We have no physical traceability - we are not claiming that the garment is of BC \nBut at the ginner side we have traceability \n2 types of CoC model - Physical and mass balance (mb) - from gin to upward actors it is physical and mb. \nAfter the ginner, we are having a system of BCCU (BC Claim Unit- 1 BCCU = 1 kg of lint cotton) . If 100 kg lint cotton is sold from ginner to spinner then 100 BCCU will appear in the spinner&amp;#x27;s account. That 100 BCCU can be used by spinner for any cotton. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; this is mb.\nThis mb points can be used by the spinner without selling the actual cotton \nIn mb there is a requirement of physical transaction then only points will be transferred to spinner account. \nDuring audits, we try to get the sense if points have been transferred without actual physical transfer - we track this. \nIn the physical method - cotton has to be segregated at all steps of VC - but there is a risk of mixing. This method we have introduced last year - we use both methods of mb and physical.\n Notes_Robin - supply chain NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Overview of the Better Cotton Assurance approach Roles and responsibilities of BC staff\n Compliance to credibility\n Sampling Level of confidence in assurance results Link to transcript NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Lalit Sharma Assurance approach (to understand if PUs are complying to BC standards or not - includes lists etc.) \n- It differs between the PU - licensing for old vs new \n- Partners conduct internal assessment of PU before BC licensing \n- Old PUs - assessment visit, license for three years, whenever it is getting expired BC will do it. \n- Surveillance assessment is for those who have an active license - incase there is any change in farmer participation or if there is any red flag raised in previous visits - then this assessment is conducted. \n- Assurance activities are mostly time bound \n- Assurance is an umbrella term - licensing is just a part of it. Even assessment comes under it like data verification, etc.\n\nAssessment process (Assurance is the umbrella term and assessment is a part of it)\n- There are principles and criteria in place which have some indicators in them\n- PUs have to comply to these principles \n- Assurance team comprises - 2 sets of assessors (BC + third party verifiers) - 4 organizations currently empanelled as TPV. People like lalit who do assessment - 4 to 5 people \n- PUs are intimated one week in advance - a template is shared with them which outlines the requirements. There are some docs also which are required to be submitted by PU before the assessment - we give them three days to give it to us.\n Role of Lalit : \n- He has joined BC 4 years ago and is working as Assurance Cooridnator &amp;gt;&amp;gt; he has a reporting manager \n- He is involved in - Assurance activities: \n- Data management (farmers list, adjusted figures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data) \n- Assurance activities calendar preparation (licensing, etc.) \n- Training of PUMs / FFs on various lists\n- Purpose of assurance - whether PUs are complying to standards or not. Within assurance we have different compliances (like list) + assessment conducted every three years. Assurance activities are defined set of requirement for eg. data - early season data, adjusted figures after one month of sowing, farm level data, self assessment, etc. \n- Before the start of the season we approach program partners to ask them about sowing dates, harvesting - based on these dates we decide the calendar activity for PUs \n- Lalit gets data in separate files as per INTL\nExpectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors: \n- Requirements to partners made clear \n- We plan our activities in advance so that partners are aware of when to submit \n- We also ensure that data from the field is of good quality - we thoroughly investigate it. \n- All communication from our end should be on time so that PCs have time to complete on time. \nRole of BC staff &amp;amp; TPV same - 3 day exercise \n- 1st day: opening meeting - PUs give introduction / PPT - interview with staff members, During this meeting, they also inform the villages that the team will be visiting the next day\n- 2nd day: 2 LGs are covered - 5 farmers from each LG minimum - farmers + workers are interviewed. On this day we tell them about the next day&amp;#x27;s villages. \n- 3rd day: Morning - 1 LG - 5 farmers meeting - Post lunch: closing remarks / meeting. We dont give any recommendations or idea of how the PU is doing - all that goes in the report. \n- After this - we make a report and submit it to the India Assurance Team and also to the global assurance team. Licensing is in their hands. \n- BC staff and TPV visits separately to separate PUs - we have a ratio of 60:40 - 60% assessment will be done by TPV and 40% by BC. \n- Assessment process same as above \n- There is flexibility in conducting the interviews - more than 3 LGs can also be interviewed - minimum is 3 \n- TPV also has to submit a report to India Assurance Team\nSupport provided by BC to TPV and WWF \n- CS vertical - Relationship management team - in touch with WWF Telangana - we provide the standard protocol to the partners - it is up to them how they want to design the meetings / training calendar -they just have to comply with the principles. Incase PC wants any clarification or want to access a knowledge partner then BC conducts TOT. \n- We have separate templates for different data sets - we train the PUMs and PCs on how to fill this template - since RIR is technical. \n Integrity of Data: \n- Earlier we had encountered the issue of fake farmers - when we receive the list of farmers from PU we cross check by calling a few farmers and asking them if they know they are a part of the BC program. \n- We have details of PU Staff - who are responsible for particular LGs - we call at least 5-10 farmers under each FF (non lead farmers since they are reliable) \n- Random selection of 5-10 farmers - we used to ask their names, father names, whether they know BC program \n- Right now they dont do this calling exercise - we have told partners that we can do this cross check anytime \n- Processes followed currently - whenever they receive a file they look from quality POV - correct format, units, duplication, etc. \n- For different data sets we have different cleaning exercises. For eg. RIR is checked by the global team. We just glance and check for basic things and follow the global team - they do a deep dive \nFactors considered for credibility in assessment process \n- Process are designed in a way that is impartial \n- It is recommended to assessors not to give suggestions to PUs during their visits \n- Anti bribery policy - no gifts to be considered from PUs \nRisks considered \n- When we used to inform PU about the assessment dates they used to revert saying there is xx festival - so we have asked partners to share dates with us \n- Recently 1 PU told us that there is some staffing issue and all the FFs had got terminated so they asked for time extension - sometimes even PUM not well etc. - so if particular staff is not available we assess how crucial they are for our assessment - if not very crucial then we are ok and continue with the assessment \n- Weather issues - farmers are not in mood to talk when weather is not good \nEfficiency in assurance process \n- Approach is good enough \n- We have an arm for CS also which is unique to BC \n- We have a whole picture in the three day assessment - at the end of the day we want to understand the impact \n- We only talk to 15 farmers but this is good to get an idea - as general practices are same across LGs \nFactors contributing to non compliance from farmers \n- Adoption of PPE kit - we want farmers to use them but weather conditions are such they dont wear \n- Sometimes extension agents (pesticide vendors) tell farmers to mix chemicals \n- Certain chemicals BC bans but it is cheap and easily available to farmers so they opt for it (for eg. monocrotophos) \n- We have run campaigns to discourage such behavior\nHow do the existing assurance systems and processes work to mitigate the risks/ influence associated with free riders and non-BC farmers?\nThis will remain a challenge - we dont have details of ALL farmers since we dont have resources for that. Even in the PURE we cant say there wont be free riders \n\n\n - In the limited time we have (3 days) - 15 farmers is fair - but we also do FGDs to cross check \n- Sample size is fixed for us - 15 - random sampling \n- We also talk to local resources - pesticides shop owner, sarpanch, etc. \n- Therefore , 15 farmers + FGDs + local resources is good enough \n- We are well versed on how to talk to farmers and we are also well versed with the geography - makes our job easier \n- He feels the sample size is representative - sampling is done on our own as in the LG selection is on us. We do it on following factors - based on rain fed farmers, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, response of FF in opening meeting \n- Selection bias prevention - Assessors select the LGs \n- Respondent bias prevention - we are as objective as possible \n- Scope of the assessment (duration and sample) limit the assessors’ ability \nIn case we feel that three LGs is not enough or if something is inconclusive - we are free to consider 4 or 5 LGs \n- Challenges in assurance process \n- Nothing as such - just the risks i mentioned above\n- Remote locations - traveling becomes too far - even between LG farmers \n - Means of verification used to validate/triangulate the findings - FGDs + local resource information\n- For rating of level of confidence please see detailed transcript Notes_Assurance_BC Staff_Lalit NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Participant Overview of the MEL approach Implementation of the MEL system Quality Assurance Sampling Level of confidence in MEL results Transcript NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Sonal Dhingra - MEL We have split data into two categories - \n- Reach data (area, number of farmers &amp;amp; production) - for each PU we get reach data \n- RIR - Result Indicators Report - sample of farmers taken from each PU and we try to understand - what was the water use, pesticide use (bio vs chemicals) \n- Sonal majorly deals with RIR data \nWhat is her role? / activities \n- Sonal is the senior coordinator - global MEL - she works with one more coordinator who looks after reach (Phelix). Shannon - boss of both. \n- We receive this data 12 weeks after the harvest - Sonal does gap analysis (basic completeness check, data validity - eg, area irrigated cannot be higher than area under cultivation, if all active ingredients of a pesticide are listed in the data or not, etc.) - whatever is possible \n- If data is not ok - we reach out to partners \n- Data is recorded in a particular format - from FFB to RIR - the data is not transferred without issues. - so gap analysis helps. \n- After this basic check, we do outlier check - we compare PUs average with the farms average - in terms of yield, if a PUs yield is 135 kg per ha but for a particular farm it is 1000 kg per ha - then we question the data \n- Sometimes it is an error and sometimes it is a genuine issue \n- So there is a lot of back and forth between country MEL, global MEL, partners \n- Farmer level - FFB &amp;gt; FF &amp;gt; PUM + MEL person at partner level &amp;gt; RIR \n- Hidden layer between FFB and PUM - partners maintain an internal excel which is easy - they agg values and they input the values in the RIR \n- Mostly PUMs fill the RIR with help of FFs or MEL person at partner level\n Set of Activities under MEL (done by Sonal) \n- Gap analysis\n- Outlier check (PU’s average with farmer average is compared - involves lot of back and forth - this is a very big issue as it delays sending data further)\n- Data updation on Cotton Cloud (database) - Power BI DB \n \nReporting requirements that Better Cotton MEL mandates from the PU:\n- Reach data - broken down in multiple parts - you also get in early season estimates - farmers who are expected to grow cotton this year, etc. we update this figure in terms of area, production, and final number of farmers who are growing cotton (late estimate data) . \n- Then post harvest data - it will come at the same time as RIR \n- RIR data - Main three sheets - area &amp;amp; production, fertilizer use, pesticide use and three more sheets -\n- Number of training that happens in the entire season (description, training, duration, attendance, etc.) training is further divided into farmers and workers. \n- Contextual information: we introduced it three years back - questions at PU level - was the water level higher than last year, costs higher than last year, etc. \n- These three sheets help us answer reasons for some outlier \n\nSupport provided by the Better Cotton team to the WWF in the successful completion of the monitoring process\n- Dashboards are something that partners are using data quality - how much chemicals / pesticides they have used, income variation across seasons, \n- We are talking with partners regularly and the MEL team trying to collab with partners directly, understanding pain points from partners - RIR\n Are all the types of data collected and reported in a timely manner? If not, what are the reasons for delays? \n- no major delays from Partner (deadline is 3 months after the harvest) they report diligently - but when we get back with clarifications it takes time for them to revert. \n- Deadline for actual sharing of RIR - i have not seen any delays\n\nWhat are the steps taken to rectify errors found in data collection and entry?\n- Yield for alot of farmers is the same in a PU - sampled farmers say 200 -&amp;gt; 100 end up having the same yield. how can that be possible ? - they must be guesstimating - but sometimes there are genuine reasons as all farmers are close by - same climatic conditions, same pest attacks, etc. \n- Farmers usually know their land size in bigha and BC asks for land size in ha, so sometimes the numbers are lost in translation.\n- Farmers should be seeing sale receipts - small farmers dont have weighing machines - they dont know how much they have produced and sold. FFs should check the sale receipt. We are trying to put this in the minds of PUMs / FF\n\nWhat are the challenges encountered by the BC team when data is received from the ground (from partners/country or MEL team)? \n- Timeliness in terms of clarification is a big issue we face. The first set of data they give is timely but when we ask for clarification it takes alot of time and we are frozen. So we are very dependent on partners answers,\n- Unit conversion (from bigha to acres to ha as BC demand data in ha) difference in units compared with BC and what is followed region wise - is an issue , \n- Fertilizer - we ask them how much kilogram is used - but since they are small farmers, they report in ML - unit is a big issue. \nSonal deals with multiple countries so it is even more challenging as farm size categorisation is different across countries. \n\n\n Lot of changes have happened - because of COVID and methodology based changes \nTwo types of farmers - BC farmers + Lead farmers (every LG has one) \nBefore COVID - \n- we used to sample using 95% CI and 5% MoE - say there are 3500 farmers per PU - we used to ask for 500 to 600 farmers (can be between 350 to 600) - this includes all the lead farmers (100 to 125) + BC farmers \n- Methodology - 100 LGs for any PU - randomly select 10 LGs (country team selects) and pick up all farmers in that LG (35 farmers each LG) - 350 - remaining 90 LGs where lead farmers are selected. \n- Was it representative? Our unit of analysis - LG - LGs were formed to ensure smooth training purposes .. farmers were randomly selected but the lead farmers were not random - so you can say this was a flaw .. at one point we were comparing lead farmers with BC farmers.. We used to also compare BC farmers with comparison farmers of the same PU. \n- Despite all this we were not reporting on lead farmers outside.. (since it was not random sample).. We were reporting on BC farmers versus comparison farmers (non BC farmers) \nPost COVID \n- 95% , 10% - 200 farmers per PU - out of 200 = 100 lead farmers + 100 BC farmers - mandate to collect lead farmers did not change. \n- 100 BC / lead farmers Farmers - methodology - randomly selected 10 LGs out of which 9 BC farmers randomly selected each LG = 90 BC farmers + 1 Lead farmer from each LG from remaining LGs &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 200. \n- FFB - 5 farmers each LG since feedback received that a lot of time of FF going behind FFB. Therefore changed to support only 5 farmers per LG. \n- Before COVID all farmers under LG were selected later only few \n- Now I am more confident in the methodology, it is representative. (PURE) \n- Any suggestions: Lead farmer selection should have been scrapped - \n For rating of confidence in MEL results see Transcript\n\nMeans of Verification: MEL team is not well resourced to do those kind of verifications (Rating: ⅔) - lot of scope for improvement. \nCountry workshops are being held - better collabs with partners which will help us better connect with partners. \n MEL-BC Staff_26062024.docx NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN --- Sheet: Time spent --- Unnamed: 0 Unnamed: 1 Unnamed: 2 Unnamed: 3 Unnamed: 4 Unnamed: 5 Unnamed: 6 Unnamed: 7 Unnamed: 8 Unnamed: 9 Unnamed: 10 Unnamed: 11 Unnamed: 12 Unnamed: 13 Unnamed: 14 NaN NaN NaN Vanita (INTL 23) NaN NaN Rakesh (INTL 02) NaN NaN Ramesh (INTL 23) NaN NaN Sony (INTL 01) NaN NaN NaN Task Department Timeline (months and frequency) Time taken for task completion Percentage of total time spent Timeline (months and frequency) Time taken for task completion Percentage of total time spent Timeline (months and frequency) Time taken for task completion Percentage of total time spent Timeline (months and frequency) Time taken for task completion Percentage of total time spent NaN Administration Administration Daily 1/2 hour 0.3 Daily NaN 0.2 Daily 3.5 hours 0.3 Daily 3 hours (2-5PM) 0.3 NaN Farmers list Data Daily 10 to 15 mins (heavy work during start of the deason when fresh list is to be made / renewed) 0.4 Annually It takes 15 to 20 minutes from each farmer and it takes 2 to 3 days to collect info from one village and for all villages under him 10 to 15 days 0.3 NaN NaN 0.45 Annually 80% of the time is spend on Farmers List modification during the 1 month period 0.4 NaN Attendance NaN Daily 10 to 15 mins NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Daily 10-15 minutes NaN NaN Training &amp;amp;

The team excels in facilitating Theory of Change processes, conducting alternative analyses, and building robust evidence through diverse methodologies. They actively engage in participatory learning and action, establishing efﬁcient systems for monitoring, evaluation, and learning. The Research and Evaluation Team at CMS collaborates with a range of partners, including multilateral and bilateral organisations, government entities, NGOs, faith-based organisations, community-based organisations, network organisations, and social movements. Their expertise spans various methodologies, including experimental, quasi-experimental, mixed-methods, and qualitative approaches, at both national and international levels. 1.2.1. List of Past Assignments 1. Baseline Survey of Better Cotton: Producer Unit Rescoping (PURE) Pilot CMS conducted the baseline assessment for Better Cotton’s Producer Unit (PU) rescoping pilot in Telangana. The intervention aimed to reorganize three existing PUs (INTL01, INTL02, and INTL23), operating across Karimnagar and Warangal districts, into a single, larger unit. This restructuring was designed to enhance scalability, strengthen ﬁeld-level capacity building, streamline data systems, and improve traceability from farm to ginner. The assessment aimed to validate the core problem statements underpinning the rescoping intervention and establish benchmark values for seven key performance indicators. It also sought to understand existing ﬁeld realities around data burden, capacity-building efforts, gender participation, and traceability systems. These insights were intended to inform the design, implementation, and future scaling of the reorganized Producer Unit model. Our role involved designing and executing the baseline study through an integrated methodology—combining qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and quantitative surveys with 120 farmers—to generate a robust evidence base for future monitoring and implementation. 2. Baseline, Midline and Endline study of cotton farmers in Maharashtra and Telangana of the “IDH – BCI-Evaluation Project” CMS conducted the IDH – BCI-Evaluation, encompassing baseline, midline, and endline studies, in collaboration with Wageningen University as a research partner. The study focused on data collection with the objective of evaluating farmers practising sustainable cotton practices under the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI). This comprehensive research initiative covered 1750 farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The survey aimed to collect baseline information on BCI farmers, facilitating a thorough examination of the impact of BCI practices on their proﬁtability and overall improvements. The study, designed as a quantitative inquiry through household surveys, was strategically implemented to Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The involvement of CMS in overseeing the evaluation process further adds to the credibility and quality assurance of the study. 3. Evaluation Study: Enhancing Livelihoods in Cotton-Dependent Families in Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat and Punjab under IDH Cotton Fast Track Programme CMS conducted an evaluation within the IDH Cotton Fast Track Programme, impacting around 400,000 cotton farmers in key Indian regions—Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, and Punjab. Beyond the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), IDH aims to address family-level livelihood issues for a lasting impact. The objective is to identify key factors inﬂuencing livelihoods and household economies in cotton-dependent areas and propose areas for an independent program. The study, overseen by CMS, employs a mixed-concurrent methodology, covering 576 households, Focus Group Discussions, and Key Informant Interviews. This approach ensures a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting livelihoods and household economies. 4. Impact evaluation of the C&amp;amp;A Foundation (now Laudes Foundation) and Cotton Connect supported Organic Cotton Farmer training program (3ie, Cotton Connect) (2014-Ongoing) CMS conducted a six-year impact evaluation of the Organic Cotton Farmer training program, aimed at supporting 16,000 farmers in India to transition to an organic production system. The study, including a three-year organic certiﬁcation period, assessed the viability of organic cotton production compared to conventional methods and the success of farmers adopting it through extension services. Utilising a quasi-experimental design and mixed methods, the evaluation covered over 8,000 program and non-program farmers across Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. 5. Baseline Study of “Accelerating Income: Strong Organisations, Thriving Farmers Project” for Heifer Project International (September 2020 - February 2021) Heifer International sought to launch a new project in Andhra Pradesh, a region where they hadn&amp;#x27;t previously operated. After exploring four districts (Krishna, East Godavari, Nellore, and Anantapur), the organisation aimed to enhance Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) by introducing poultry production in the state. The goal was to develop, test, and reﬁne a poultry intervention model that complements existing value chains for FPOs and Small Holder Farmers (SHFs). The initial 30-month phase focused on supporting pro-poor farmers toward achieving a living income. CMS provided baseline services enabling Heifer to measure various indicators, from social capital to actual income levels, at both FPO and household levels. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Our Understanding of ToR 2.1. About the program Better Cotton stands as the globe&amp;#x27;s foremost cotton sustainability initiative. Its mission is dedicated to fostering the survival and prosperity of cotton communities while safeguarding and rejuvenating the health of the community and environment. Through a widespread network of on-the-ground collaborators, Better Cotton has delivered training on more sustainable farming practices to over 2.9 million cotton farmers across 26 nations. The innovative pilot project called - the &amp;#x27;Producer Unit Rescoping&amp;#x27; (PURE) pilot aims to try out a new, landscape-based approach to implementing the Better Cotton system at the farm level to improve efﬁciency and effectiveness of the program. Instead of the prevailing method that centres solely on speciﬁed (typically male) farmers on a designated list, PURE broadens its scope to encompass all farming households within a deﬁned geographic unit in the Better Cotton programs. The PURE pilot has now completed its ﬁrst year of implementation in Karimnagar district of Telangana state, catering to about 10,200 cotton farmers across 148 villages. This midline evaluation aims to assess progress toward objectives and identify adjustments needed for optimal implementation in Year 2.1.1. Objectives of the Program The PU rescoping intervention primarily has the following 3 objectives - ● Enhance capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labour practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. ● Improve efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. ● Support Better Cotton&amp;#x27;s traceability goal by strengthening farm-to-gin traceability and eliminating individual farm segregation. 2.1.2. Objectives of the Evaluation Given the context of the program, the overall objective of the project MEL is to: ● Evaluate project outcomes and objectives against the baseline ﬁndings established in early 2024 ● Evaluate the feasibility aspects of replicating or scaling up the pilot ● Identify both the drivers of success and the challenges faced during Year 1 implementation ● Provide recommendations on needed adjustments in project assumptions and implementation approaches ● Compare the cost-effectiveness of the conceptual approaches with the actual ground implementation Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

Technical Approach 3.1 Baseline Evaluation Overview CMS conducted the baseline study in July 2024, which brought forth substantial evidence validating issues that the PU rescoping intervention intends to address like extensive efforts spent in data and administration, low participation of women farmers in the Better Cotton initiatives, less volumes of Better Cotton processed in the supply chain, and issues with the associated assurance and MEL systems. For the baseline study, CMS conducted in-depth qualitative interactions with a majority of the stakeholders 1 in the Better cotton value chain and quantitative surveys with 120 farmers, across the three PUs - INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23 located in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of Telangana. Factors of heterogeneity in the population such as type of PU, block, village, land size and irrigation pattern were considered to identify and arrive at the ﬁnal sample using multi-stage and proportional quota sampling techniques. At the end, CMS provided programmatic level recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the pilot intervention, from the point of view of the stakeholders interviewed such as organising separate meetings for women farmers, simpliﬁcation of data collection and documentation processes, aggregation and sale of Better cotton etc. 3.2 Monitoring and Evaluation Approach at Midline The midline evaluation approach builds on our baseline methodology while introducing speciﬁc elements for comparative analysis so as to measure progress against baseline benchmarks. Our approach follows a systematic progression as shown below. 1 Stakeholders include Field Facilitators, PU Managers, Project Coordinator, Program farmers, Co-farmers, non-program farmers, third party veriﬁers, assurance coordinator, MEL coordinator, ginner, and BC evaluation team. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

This will help assess whether the original assumptions, intended outcomes, and indicators still hold true. Any shifts in the program context or strategy since the baseline will be mapped, and learning questions will be reﬁned accordingly to ensure relevance and focus. CMS will examine the degree to which the initial assumptions are holding true after one season of implementation and reﬁne or add learning questions to ensure the midline captures both progress and potential pivots needed. A review of key project documents including implementation progress reports, partner updates (especially from WWF), MIS data, will be conducted. The program activity, outputs and outcome key performance indicators and measurement of success would be reviewed in conjunction with the project assumptions. ● Pre-ﬁeld assessment workshops - Discussions with the Better Cotton team and WWF Telangana teams would be conducted to ﬁnalise the monitoring and evaluation approach (i.e. the ﬁnal sample size, ﬁnalisation of KPIs, inputs on tool design and the analytical approach).

This includes disaggregating farmer program participation and access by gender, capturing cotton farming areas under uniﬁed management systems, and assessing community-wide engagement. The tools will also track operational efﬁciency metrics, such as the ratio of ﬁeld staff time spent on capacity building versus administrative tasks. Survey and interview tools would be developed by the CMS team and validated by the Better Cotton team and WWF Telangana before being deployed in the ﬁeld. The quantitative survey would be digitised on the SurveyCTO platform in English and in Telugu. Qualiﬁed enumerators would be hired to administer the CAPI tool. ● Field assessment - Having extensively conducted ﬁeld assignments in southern India (and especially in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) in general and PURE baseline assessment in particular, the data collection team at CMS (community engagement lead, supervisors and enumerators) is well-versed with the regional milieu and possess excellent written and verbal communication skills in Telugu besides English. The data collection will measure progress against baseline benchmarks and focus on thematic areas such as inclusivity, effectiveness, efﬁciency, scalability, capacity strengthening, gender participation, and trust in the revised assurance and MEL systems. Quantitative surveys would be conducted with the sampled PU farmers as per the sampling strategy described below. Information would be captured qualitatively using Focus Group Discussions with the farmers and conducting Key Informant Interviews with staff from the program team, representatives from the community and the ginner. Sampling Strategy - Given that the Producer Unit rescoping pilot is going to be conducted with a population of over 10,200 farming households covering over 9000 acres of farmland, the sample size calculated is chosen such that it is sufﬁcient to draw inferences for the population while also adhering to the prescribed budgetary constraints. For Quantitative surveys Sample Size proposed - 90 for the farmer quantitative survey. Parameters include – ● Conﬁdence Level - 90% ● Margin of Error - 8.66% ● Population Proportion - 50% ● Population size - 10,200 We propose sampling from and interviewing the same set of farmers who were surveyed during the baseline so that the performance of the same cohort can be tracked at different intervals of time enabling identiﬁcation and effective analysis of the trends in knowledge, attitude and practices of the program farmers while controlling for unobserved factors of heterogeneity in the sample (such as motivation to participate in the program, preexisting levels of knowledge etc).

All analysis will be carried out in stages. At ﬁrst, descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, quartile distribution will be done along with frequency tables to measure KPIs. Then as a second step, causality would be established using evaluation methods as relevant to the methodology adopted for this evaluation. This will provide impact estimates for the program. ○ Qualitative analysis - The qualitative interactions (FGDs / KIIs) and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground and perspectives of important stakeholders vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. We will prepare thematic coding to identify patterns in data, draw narratives that can be used to triangulate the inferences gathered from analysis of the quantitative data. The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the KIIs using software such as Nvivo or Atlas.ti. ○ The use of relevant AI tools for data analysis and presentation will also be explored for uncovering hidden patterns and aiding the research team in generating and presenting valuable insights from the data. 3.2.1. Evaluation Framework ○ The program MEL objectives and KPIs (measured through the quantitative survey) would be analysed using the OECD DAC deﬁned six evaluation criteria – relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efﬁciency, impact and sustainability (RCEEIS). It is pertinent to mention here that the ‘Relevance’ criteria was established during the baseline which helped us understand the alignment of the Better Cotton program with the needs of the community and the region. ○ For the midline study, we intend to assess the project outcomes considering the criteria of ‘Efﬁciency’ and ‘Effectiveness’. Under Efﬁciency, CMS will assess how well the program has utilized available resources (time, funds, personnel) to deliver the intended outcomes, including whether the new approach offers better reach and impact with similar or reduced effort compared to the traditional model. Under Effectiveness, CMS will assess the extent to which the PURE pilot has achieved its intended objectives — such as increased community participation, gender inclusion, and improved capacity strengthening—after one year of implementation. The criteria of ‘Coherence’ would also be explored by considering the alignment of the PURE pilot with other initiatives/schemes being implemented in the region by government/non-government entities or market players.

This framework is represented in the diagram shown below. Figure: RCEEIS Framework The analytical framework would be focussed to capture the key narratives of the project implementation at midline by establishing the following: 1) Evaluation of project objectives at midline a) Assess effectiveness and efﬁciency of project implementation and management by tracking key performance indicators of the project at midline and comparing with the baseline. b) Use case-control to separately study farmer cohorts that are performing better or worse at the midline as compared to baseline and understand the pathways of change employed by both groups. c) Use gender analysis frameworks to be aware of the agency of women farmers in the region; assess their role in the PURE approach vis-à-vis the traditional approach and as compared to male farmers. 2) Feasibility of replicating and scale up of the pilot project Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

CEA provides the outcomes of the investment in programs as a simple ratio of costs to impacts. This helps us to use it as a measure to compare the cost efﬁciency of different programs and in the proposal there is a research objective demanding economic evaluation of the Improved cost-efﬁciency of Better Cotton implementation. 5) Veriﬁcation of processes adhered and assumptions a) Examine adherence to PURE pilot design and methodology b) Validate MEL indicators, assurance systems, and implementation assumptions utilised for the PU pilot. The above objectives will be achieved through a mixed methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. Conducting this midline evaluation and analysing the outcomes using the OECD DAC RCEEIS criteria is intended to and ultimately aimed at providing evidence (drivers for success and challenges) for gauging the status of project KPIs and implementing the PURE approach at scale. ○ Systems and documentation review - Along with RCEEIS, the role of ﬁdelity and process adherence would be reviewed against set SoPs, documents, reported and unreported information. They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

A mapping of project outcomes to some KPIs and the stakeholder-wise data collection methods is given below. Project Outcomes KPIs to monitor outputs and outcomes at Midline Stakeholders Data collection methods - Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact - Amount of time, cost &amp;amp; resources spent by ﬁeld staff on administrative and data collection efforts (time, cost and resources).

Quality Control Mechanism With over 200 projects and an in-house portfolio for data collection, CMS has strong expertise in ensuring quality data collection and follows strong protocols in the data collection process. Monitoring of data quality is the most important aspect of data collection. Therefore, the research team sets clear guidelines and protocols for the monitoring and quality assurance that include maintaining a real-time MIS dashboard of collection, minimising non-response with 2-3 attempts, ensuring enumerator quality controls with spot checks, back checks (on major topics, time taken, etc.) and looping mechanisms. The CMS team has robust processes for data management. The quantitative data is stored online on secured servers synched in real-time that ensure data security. All hard copies of the research notes, qualitative interviews, etc. are scanned and uploaded almost in real-time to avoid any loss of data. Data cleaning is perhaps the most critical step between data collection and data analysis. CMS believes that it is a rigorous process, and that the quality of the analysis is correlated to the quality of data cleaning. Most of the data validation exercise is completed in real-time to avoid post-cleaning efforts including id variable checking, outlier tagging, missing values and replacements, illogical value assessment, addressing typos, survey codes, missing values and adding labels. Irregularities and corrections are identiﬁed and documented, but changes are made only after introspection with the ﬁeld team and the qualitative insights. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

It has to follow a pre-specified format, and Excel&amp;#x27;s conditional formatting has been used to auto-highlight rows that appear to have a valid type column -- so, if you are using Excel and your row is not automatically highlighted, re-check that you have entered the type properly. See below for an exhaustive list of brief examples. This column specifies the name of the field or group. Field names must be unique, and they cannot include any spaces or punctuation. Example: age For those field types that present a user interface, this column is where you put the primary text for the question or field. You can include line-breaks in your label text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac. Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language. Text in this column, if any, will appear italicized beneath the field&amp;#x27;s label. You can include line-breaks in your hint text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac. Any hint:languagename column (e.g., hint:tamil) may be added in order to provide hints in an alternative language. If you want to default the user&amp;#x27;s entry or selection for a given field, you can specify a number or some text in this column. \n\nAlternatively, you can specify an expression for dynamically calculating the field&amp;#x27;s default entry or selection, in the calculation column. See the following help topic for more details: How can I provide default entries or selections for users filling out my form? For field types that allow multiple appearances, you can specify the appearance style in this column (e.g., quick or minimal for select_one fields). See the individual examples below. Enter an expression into this column to validate entered or selected values. The user will only be allowed to proceed to the next question when the expression evaluates to true. Use the constraint builder to build new constraint expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) Example: . &amp;lt; 130 If the user tries to move forward but the constraint expression is false, a generic &amp;quot;That entry is invalid&amp;quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column. Any constraint message:languagename column (e.g., constraint message:tamil) may be added in order to provide constraint messages in an alternative language. Enter an expression into this column to control when a field or group displays to the user (i.e., to control when it is &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot;). The field or group will only show up to users when the expression in this column evaluates to true; otherwise, it will remain hidden. Use the relevance builder to build new relevance expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) Example: ${age} &amp;lt; 18 Enter yes into this column to temporarily disable a field. (Rarely used.) Enter yes into this column to require that users enter or select a value before continuing. If the user tries to move forward without entering or selecting a value for a required field, a generic &amp;quot;Sorry, this response is required&amp;quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column. Any required message:languagename column (e.g., required message:tamil) may be added in order to provide required messages in an alternative language. Enter yes into this column to make it read-only (a user can see the field, but cannot enter or select a value). (Rarely used, because note fields, which are by nature read-only, are automatically read-only regardless of what is specified here.) This column specifies the expression to use for a calculate field, or the expression to use for calculating the default entry or selection for a visible form field. Use the calculation builder to build new calculation expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) For a begin repeat row, this column can specify the number of times to repeat the group of questions. (Can be a fixed count like 3 or a reference to an earlier field like ${numhh_members}.) To include an image to display for a field (in addition to or in lieu of its label), its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. Example: paddy.png To include a sound clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. Example: explanation.3gpp To include a video clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. Example: demonstration.mp4 Any media:image:languagename column (e.g., media:image:tamil) may be added in order to provide images for an alternative language. Any media:audio:languagename column (e.g., media:audio:tamil) may be added in order to provide audio clips for an alternative language. Any media:video:languagename column (e.g., media:video:tamil) may be added in order to provide video clips for an alternative language. When filtering lists of multiple-choice options, this column specifies, for each field, which prior field should be used when filtering the list of options. For more details, see the following help topic: How can I filter the list of multiple-choice options presented to users? Example: filter=${survey_region} This column can specify an optional note to appear with the field in printable versions of the survey form, in order to explain when groups or fields will appear (i.e., when they are relevant), what restrictions there are on user entries (i.e., what constraints apply), etc. This column can specify optional text or symbols to appear in the response area to the right of questions in printable versions of the survey form. For a text field, for example, you might put something like |___|___| if you are looking for two letters or numbers; or, for a checkbox, you might put a hollow square like □ (this is a special HTML character: enter &amp;quot;&amp;amp;#9633;&amp;quot;, without quotes, into this column); finally, for a radio button, you might simply enter a capital O. Enter yes into this column to indicate that a field in an encrypted form should be left unencrypted so that it can be published to one or more datasets. Use only for non-sensitive fields that can be left unencrypted without compromising data security. (This field is ignored for unencrypted forms.) Enter a number of seconds that represents the minimum time enumerators should spend the first time they view the field. This represents a &amp;quot;speed limit&amp;quot; that can be enforced by Collect (with the Enforce minimum times for fields option within Collect&amp;#x27;s Admin Settings); alternatively, you can track violations with the following field types: &amp;quot;speed violations count&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed violations list&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;speed violations audit&amp;quot; (see examples for these field types below).

For regular option lists, all possible options will be listed here, one option per row. For option lists that will be dynamically loaded from a pre-loaded .csv file, there will be a single row that indicates from which .csv columns to load the option values, labels, and images (see the following help topic: How do I dynamically load multiple-choice options from pre-loaded data?). NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN list_name value label label:languagename image image:languagename filter This column specifies the name of a multiple-choice question type (without any spaces or punctuation). A given list of options will involve multiple rows, each with the same list_name. Example: yesno This column specifies the internal value stored for a given choice. (It should really be called &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;.) Example: 1\n\nIf dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load option values. This column specifies the label to use for a given choice, in the form&amp;#x27;s default language. Example: Yes\n\nIf dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name -- or comma-separated list of column names -- from which to load option labels for the default language. Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language. To include an image to display for an option, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. Example: paddy.png\n\nIf dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load image filenames. Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide images in an alternative language. To filter the list of options displayed, a filter value can be specified here, along with a filter expression in the choice_filter column of the survey worksheet. For example, you might have filter values like LAC and a choice_filter like filter=${survey_region}.

NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN form_title form_id version public_key submission_url default_language This is the title of your form. If you begin this title with TEST - (as in &amp;quot;TEST - Household listing survey&amp;quot;), it will not appear by default to users (see the following help topic: How can I prevent forms from appearing until after I am finished testing them?). This is the unique ID that will identify the form. While the form title can have spaces and can be changed from time to time, the form ID must not contain spaces and must remain fixed for the life of the form. The form ID must also begin with a letter, and it can only include letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (no other punctuation or special characters). Example: hhlisting_round1 This is the version number of the form, which you must increase each time you modify an existing form. If you started with a form template or with one of the sample forms, then this is automatic: the version is set to a formula that automatically increments every minute. (Otherwise, you need to increment the version number yourself, taking care to keep the number of digits fixed; the version has to be a single whole number, and its number of digits has to stay the same from one version to the next. The convention is to always use a ten-digit number that represents the current date and time, e.g., 1401130917 for 9:17AM on January 13, 2014. Alternatively, you can use 10-digit numbers like 0000000001 and 0000000024 or 3-digit numbers like 001 and 024.) This is the public key with which to encrypt all form submissions. See the following help topic for details: How do I encrypt my data? This is the submission URL to use when submitting encrypted forms. See the following help topic for details: How do I encrypt my data? This is the name of the language associated with labels, images, and other content when no other language is specified. For example, the label:french column is clearly in French, but the label column, which will display by default, is in an unknown language. Put the name of that default language here. See the following help topic for details: How do I translate my form into multiple languages?</Content>

    <Content>Bridging the Gap: Addressing Healthcare Inequities in Rural Rajasthan and Odisha As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, marginalized populations continue to face profound challenges, especially those living in digital deserts. These are areas with inadequate digital infrastructure, where financial constraints further impede access to essential services, including healthcare services. Socioeconomic disparities compound the difficulties these communities encounter, creating substantial barriers to accessing healthcare. This digital divide not only deepens their vulnerability but also severely limits their ability to seek and receive critical medical care. According to the World Health Organisation, millions of individuals worldwide are deprived of essential healthcare services due to geographical isolation, financial barriers, and limited educational opportunities. For those who can access these services, the high costs often lead to financial hardship, pushing many into poverty. Access to healthcare, therefore, must be understood not only in terms of physical availability but also in terms of financial affordability. For marginalized populations, such as migrants, agricultural laborers, and women, in rural India, face compounded challenges due to the limited availability of healthcare facilities, constrained sources of income and gender based discrimination. Addressing healthcare disparities is essential for achieving global health goals, including Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Digital health interventions hold significant promise for overcoming access-related challenges, particularly when they incorporate community-centric approaches to enhance healthcare delivery in underserved populations. To assess the feasibility of such a platform in Rajasthan and Orissa, a comparative study was conducted in April 2024, involving 1,236 respondents from the rural areas of Alwar and Puri, respectively. The study sheds light on the profound disparities that exist in healthcare access and health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations, such as fisherfolk community, farmers, construction workers, migrants and women. This analysis highlights the multidimensional challenges faced by these populations and underscores the urgent need for targeted policy interventions to address these inequities. Socioeconomic Disparities The study reveals significant gender-based employment and income disparities across both regions. In both Alwar and Puri, around 45% of the population reported no personal income, predominantly among women. Men disproportionately occupy higher income brackets, exacerbating gender inequalities. While Alwar showed better educational outcomes, this advantage did not translate into higher employment rates. In contrast, Puri demonstrated a higher employment rate (50%), driven primarily by the fisherfolk community, which comprises a significant portion of its population. Health Behaviors and Healthcare Access Significant disparities in preventive health practices and health-seeking behaviors were observed. In Puri, 40% of respondents regularly undergo health screenings, compared to a similar proportion in Alwar who perceive no need for them. Physical activity patterns also differ, with half of Puri respondents engaging regularly, whereas 60% of those in Alwar consider it unnecessary. Healthcare access disparities are striking: 90% of respondents in Puri have healthcare facilities within a 5km radius, compared to 60% in Alwar. These geographic challenges contribute to delayed care-seeking behaviors in Alwar, where respondents are 20 times more likely to delay medical attention until symptoms worsen. This delay leads to higher emergency care utilization in Alwar (24%) than in Puri (11%), especially among women. Awareness and Utilization of Digital Health Services Teleconsultation services, which hold promise for enhancing access, remain underutilized in both regions. Awareness of these services is notably low, with only 20% of respondents aware of their existence. Alwar exhibits slightly higher awareness (30%) compared to Puri (10%). Even among those aware, only 24% actively use teleconsultation services, primarily for primary healthcare needs. Barriers to utilization include limited smartphone access, unfamiliarity with platforms, and low confidence in navigating digital services. In Alwar, the perceived utility of teleconsultation services is higher, with 56% of respondents recognizing their value compared to 21% in Puri. This disparity highlights the need for tailored interventions to increase awareness and adoption. Health Status and Quality of Life Health outcomes reveal stark disparities. In Alwar, 19% of women reported physically unhealthy days exceeding 20 days per month, compared to only 2% in Puri. Chronic impairments were more prevalent in Alwar (33%) than Puri (16%), significantly limiting daily activities and quality of life. Despite these challenges, more than half of respondents in both regions rated their health as “good” or better. Call4Swasth: Bridging the Gap Call4Svasth (C4S) is a phygital health intervention designed to provide timely and reliable access to primary healthcare till last mile through mobile phones. The hyper-local calling system requires only a working mobile to connect the patients and families to trained telecare health consultation by healthcare professionals-nurses, doctors and counsellors. By leveraging insights from the study, Call4Swasth will: Expand Digital Health Literacy: Conduct targeted awareness campaigns in regions like Puri to improve familiarity with teleconsultation services, addressing barriers such as digital illiteracy and lack of confidence. Enhance Accessibility: Collaborate with local governments to improve smartphone penetration and internet connectivity in rural areas, ensuring the platform reaches those most in need. Cater to Region-Specific Needs: Develop localized health solutions, such as preventive care modules and culturally appropriate educational content, to align with the differing health-seeking behaviors of Alwar and Puri populations. Promote Gender Equity: Focus on women’s health by addressing gender-based barriers through tailored outreach, ensuring equitable access to healthcare services. Integrate with Existing Infrastructure: Partner with local healthcare providers and NGOs to seamlessly integrate digital health services into existing systems, maximizing impact. Conclusion and Policy Implications The comparative analysis of healthcare inequities in Alwar and Puri highlights the profound intersection of socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors shaping health outcomes. Addressing healthcare inequities in underserved areas requires a multi-faceted approach. Expanding healthcare infrastructure and enhancing transportation services can significantly improve physical access to care for remote populations. Simultaneously, launching targeted health education campaigns can promote preventive care practices and empower communities to prioritize health. Strengthening social protection schemes is critical to ensuring financial access to healthcare, reducing the economic burden on marginalized groups. Investments in digital health platforms like Call4Swasth offer a promising solution to bridge gaps in traditional service delivery, providing convenient and cost-effective healthcare access to those in need.Policymakers, healthcare providers, and community leaders must collaborate to implement strategies that uphold the principles of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and leave no one behind.</Content>

    <Content>--- Sheet: Sheet1 --- Donor Type Networks and Collaborations (Social Capital Grantmaking, Fundraising and Fund Management\n Engagement Strategy (Donor engagement and partnership)\n Knowledge and Assets - Communication &amp;amp; Sector Engagement Strategy\n Human Capital and People Strategy\n Reputation and Integrity - Values and Visibility\n Market / Sector Presence and Engagement - Positioning Strategy Technology and Innovation Strategy\n Top Strengths Top areas to improve Other insights Bloomberg New 1) There is a need for collabaration\n\n2) CEEW can do both inside and outside strategy 1) Bloomberg works with a lean team, Puja is the only person in India. They don&amp;#x27;t invest in infra etc. Grantmaking etc is handled by only Puja.\n \n2) Post FCRA they had to become more direct grantees, Bloomberg prefers to have less paperwork. Earlier Shakti used to re-grant. \n\n3) In terms of CEEW no issues at this point, systems are already set up. \n\n4) No robust evaluation criteria for grantees, informal process but now it is slightly more streamlined where grantees come up with their own metrics. We only look at contribution. 1) Need integrated, organisation reporting, grantee and donor should be more in sync\n\n NaN 1) Employees are treated well, Arunabha shows good leadership skills, gives space for this team and leaders to grow.\n \n2) Need Clarity on organisation development\n\n3) Young employee base is a strength but needs to expand more\n NaN 1) CEEW are queued in the international conversation as well as on the national need 1) CEEW has potential in technology but needs to build its capacity 1) CEEW has a holistic approach- independent, advocacy, policy making connect\n\n2) Great connect with Policy makes, Arunabhas ability to influence. Policy advocacy is key.\n\n3) CEEW align with the independent, integrated and international and is very dynamic\n NaN AQ remained the key, now Bloomberg is moving towards net zero etc post COP 26 Hewlett Retained 1) Convening capacities are difficult to judge NaN NaN 1) Outreach is good, channels of communication employed is effective. Visual communication is good. 1) Grown in size, doubled in terms of number of people\n\n2) Lack of clarity for people in the org, in terms of focussing on specific areas of work. Stemming from lack of clear positioning\n\n3) As the size of the team grew, leadership was needed and this did not happen and there is a lack of clarity on who are the leaders etc. This led to lack of clear alignment between teams\n\n4) People are key to this space and CEEW made them consultants than researchers. Role clarity within the org is crucial.\n\n5) Building capacities and groom leaders 1) Independence from Govt is not something seen 1) No clear positioning on what they want to do in India ( policy issues,on Energy/Climate) in terms of strategic priorities\n\n2) Focus seems much more on whatever is interesting rather than a consistent follow up on a particular area of work in terms of outcomes, impact (Policy changes) - Hydrogen is an example. Most work not coming from thought out way for working. \n\n3) What Indian government wants to do is the priority rather than what CEEW wants to do, as a result their capacities is getting stretched. More of a bandwagon approach rather than strategic. \n\n 1) Do not see the fit in terms of technology overall, Staff seem interested but do not consider them deep experts 1) Finance work they have done is good, overall the work they do is of good quality. \n\n2) Building basic capacities in the last 10 years is commendable\n\n3) Among the top civil society players in India\n\n4) Arunabha and top leaders are good 1) Work on electric mobility has been spotty, not necessarily their fault. \n\n2) Lack of clarity on where they want to go, work is good but no direction is an issue. \n\n3) Clearly articulated agenda Knows CEEW prior to the engagement with Hewlett, seems to know few ppl in CEEW specifically as well. Hence insights were more from that rather than the engagment in specific with Hewlett. IISD Retianed 1. CEEW has a strong central level relationships. Key target of IISD is G20 and CEEW have high level contact\n2. At the state level it is hard to comment on and don&amp;#x27;t have a good sense of it. \n 1. IISD works only on specific topics and so far the collaboration with CEEW is around these topics. IISD is currently specializing in the fossil fuel and clean energy space. \n2. Main reason to select CEEW was based on the previous engagament. They felt confident to work them again\n3. CEEW had technical capacity and were also a quick learner\n4. Once IISD likes working with an org, they most likely end up working together on different projects.\n 1. Require writing and research focused\n2. Expectation from think tanks: Strong data/research skill, meticulously keep track of complex range of source, doing critical thinking of the data collected, good writers, coherent well structure accurate precise writing \n3. IISD relationships with policy makers are fairly limited so it&amp;#x27;s important for the partners/grantees of IISD to have those relationships and have a proactive approach to those opportunities and connect to policy decisions and forums. \n 1. Communication is tough with CEEW, \n2.There is lot of back and forth to get feeback from CEEW on the advocay products. They don&amp;#x27;t follow the structure (insert comments and lack of constructive comment, too many people commenting on a single draft)\n3 CEEW is the hardest working think tank in comms space but there is some culture issue with CEEW on comms \n\n4. Work on solar pumps with CEEW- \nCEEW produced Interactive data point but there is a lot more can be done to sharpen up such as on usability, could have used more effort on data platform in terms of design. \nHowever the final product is good but the process and points of communication, ctions to deliver the products are not so smooth while working with CEEW. \n\n5.Comms team of CEEW are not deeply aware of the content in terms of raising comments on IISD comms products. It becomes challenging as it feels disconnected from everything that IISD has already written in it. There is quite a mismatch \n 1. CEEW is hierarchical \nSenior people like Karthik comments are well justified and on point\nLimitation: Delay in recieving comments from senior people. Perception is that they are stretched in other things and burdened with work and hence becomes challenging to receive inputs \n2, Effectivess between comms teams &amp;amp; project team could be improved: they donot get involved in the project from the begining and hence dont know the exact context. This creates a misalignment between the comm and project team. \n 1. Within the FCRA constraints CEEW does a good job of being independent, they have become bolder in talking on topics related to NET zero phase out of coal/fossil fuel.\n2. Impressive to see CEEW become more bolder on these topics in the near future. \n3. As a leading voice in India CEEW has an opportunity to make a difference. There are real concerns around just transition, social responsibility, these are area of opportunity where CEEW can voice their opinion within the constraints they have. \n NaN 1.CEEW work is strong on finance. IISD sees CEEW as a great partner to have expertise on investment. \nBut not familiar with piloting technologies \n 1. Impressed with CEEW analytical work and writing work \n2. Great contributionon Design phase\n3. Strong on influencing phase\n NaN 1.CEEW is bit territorial when it comes to sharing contacts and creating conversation with policy influencers \n2. IISD has tried to engage with CEEW to approach donors together and never received a positive response from CEEW. IISD thinks about CEEW as a partner but the same is not conveyed from CEEW end. The flow of fund is unilateral \n SSEF Retained 1. Resistance to collaborate with different partners which could be competitive \n2. Reluctant to engage and collaborate with Competitors \n SSEF percives there are various ways to rank a TT- there is not a one tangible one \n1. Quantitative indicator - this includes Cost and policy outcomes or number to studies generated and how does it commensurate with the funding, how many studies lead to policy outcomes (not easy to measure)\n2. Qualitative indicator - TT is supposed to give thought leadership to Decision makers, how the ideas have found uptake of decision makers, led to debate in civil society. Uptake among decision makers, Diverse set of stakeholders to develop consensus \n4. For long term problem CEEW need some core funding somewhere \n5. Shakti is not a pure donar, but believes in institutional funding, does give core funding but on a small scale. Enagagement indicator during the course of fudning \n1. For funding Shakti looks for quality of work, for commissioning of work Shakti looks for objectives which are clearly articulated, subject is of importance of policy, analytical rigor, uptake of work. \n2. Project team are Satisfied with CEEW overall work, they report on time, delivery on time. Only the depth is lacking in some cases. \n3. If the shortcoming is worked upon and leaderships addresses that is important to conitnue engagement\n4. Awards and ranking of TT in global index does not matter to Shakti as a funder, The institution who are ranked high don&amp;#x27;t need to project through the ranking index, CEEW is a good insutitin and they donot need a index to project. 1. Ability to hold convenings with big players such as govt, industry\n2. Lack of depth or content in the reports published by the CEEW, \n3. Lack of depth in the analysis could be due to the desire to expand rapidly and be heard in the sector\n\n 1. Arunbha is very assertive and strong leader, knowledgeable- This has worked well for organization \n2. Arunabha has led to rapid growth of CEEW and is able to Understand the political context, diplomacy part \n3. Risk- However with this style of leadership- This could lead to people not speaking their mind (speculation)\n4. Arunabha focus is more on the his institution rather than what is important for larger audience, Projection of the institution (CEEW) comes out more strongly from the leader rather than on the problem at hand \n5. Next line of leadership were not upto the desired level of knowledge: Gulf between Arunabha and the next line of leadership. Important for Arunabha to groom the next line of leadership \n6. Strong internal quality check is important and CEEW has good quality of expert but lack depth 1. Ranking of the think tank is not important from Shakti&amp;#x27;s perspective and think tank (CEEW) need not project it. \n 1. CEEW is delhi centric but they have presence in states and Shakti is working with CEEW in Bihar \n\n2. CEEW will be getting demand from various states whicl will be good as they will get to expand \n 1. On the technology front they need to develop deeper strengths. Arunabha has great strengths on political context, international diplomacy, however on technology if CEEW wants to contribute , they need to build more depth and strengthen this. \n2. Over projection and claiming credit is CEEW weakness for eg: a) conceptualizing the thought process of IAS, b) Net zero debate 1. Arunabha has good leadership skills: Committed, subject expertise, skills and hard working. His knowledge, integrity and his skills are well established \n2. CEEW ability to convene stakeholders (govt, industry) and curation of the convening and outcome is good. \n3. Ambition is high and has propelled them to become a large institution in a short period of time. Impoprtant contributions made by young group of researchers. \n4. They have also made important contributions to policy and generated discussion in the country, evidence based knowledge surrounding COP \n 1. CEEW reports lack depthness in their content. This could be due to the desire to expand rapidly and show quick results and be heard in the sector\n2. Reluctantancy/Resistance towards Development of consortium from CEEW \n3. Strong desire of self projection and hogging the limelight often\n4. Sometime its portrayed that Institution development is more important than policy problems they are trying to solve. \n NaN SHELL NaN 1. CEEW has good connects in govt, however in terms of investors, the connections were not strong initially but later came out to be impressive with investor engagement in powering livelihood and has done well. \n2. Overall CEEW is more stronger in policy maker engagement than investor engagement front \n 1. Administrative \nCEEW takes more time to sign agreement, there legal is strong but the process are repetitive , if they are partnering with the same org again the process need not start from scratch , some level of improvement needed on the administrative side \n\n2. factors for Sustain funding \na) Action coming out of the work that is done-CEEW is good in doing this, this means they build good relations with the ecosystem. They do better in areas like advocacy and action delivery. \nb) CEEW can do better in People side\nc) Alignment with the strategy- Gender inclusion is important for SHELL and CEEW needs to step up with having a Coherent organization wide strategy and to have a clear top down strategy on Gender inclusion not just having a few people who are passionate to work on this. \n\n3) Funding of the Shell is based on the milestones. These are linked to the actions coming out. \n\n\nInstitutions and untied funds \na) SHELL won’t change the strategy and primarily fund for profit enterprises and do core funding in that space.\nb) SHELL goal is create evidence so that social enterprises can scale and get more leverage and create impact and influence funders and investors \nc) Larger scale donors might be better place to look at institutional capacity building like of CEEW \nd) Didn’t see Institutional capacity was a challenge for CEEW \n 1. Have fortnightly calls with CEEW on powering livelihood, CEEW is open and quite flexible with different donors on their needs. They are open to quicker discussion \n2. They are flexible to donors, overall engagement strategy is good\n3. They are proactive and take into account stakeholder perspective and adjust their own strategy\n\n4. Awards and ranking are not important when it comes to engaging with Think tanks\n5. For Donors the most important thing is people- team capability, this create lot of perception among donors\n 1. CEEW has Scaled their quality in terms of the output produced, Done well with publication such as newspaper publication \n2. Social media strategy could be improved as lot of people consume content through media and not report \n3. CEEW Started comic on Climate which was innovative \n4. They come out with good content but works more on producing short stories, briefly like blogs, snippets on social media that can attract people. \n5. CEEW is ahead of the other think tanks in terms of communication but have the capacity to do more in terms of social media and communications strategy- Globally they can improve, locally they are good in communication. \n6. CEEW can draw ideas from other peers in terms of communication and engagement internationally\n 1. CEEW is stretched with resources. Their team was overlapping with the two different proposals/projects - these get noticed by other donors as well.\n2. Succession planning can be improved\n3. Attrition was a challenge: Affects the continuity of the programme\n4. They can have better resource planning and doing less but big things and think about scaling their team based on the number of outputs produced. To maintain their cost effectiveness they could look into reducing the number of things/deliverables currently engaged on. \n 1. They brings credibility and do Peer reviews and quality check-and their process if quite robust which brings credibility \n2. Might need to improve their retention strategies and come up ways to retain good talent \n3. CEEW is key to these partnerships given their connection levels with key stakeholder and credibility in the ecosystem- this is the reason for success of the programme\n\nIndependence: They take in account donor&amp;#x27;s expectation and modifies their strategy but at the same time they do not compromise the real finding in the sectors and not what donor what to see. \n\nIntegration across all sector (livelihood, economy, people)\nIntegration is important, and this should stay as a core part of their work. Powering livelihood had a holistic strategy and wasn’t focused on just a single sector and this attracted SHELL to work with CEEW. \nDonors work in silos and CEEW is placed well to bridge that gap between donors and their different priority 1. Global- Expanding to look at other geographies - This might not be best suited to CEEW, they need to first invest in resources in order to execute/operate this. They can look partnering with other org as a knowledge transfer to increase and expand their brand globally but perceive that CEEW is not yet globally to start implementation. They can represent India internationally. \n2. National- They are better placed locally/Nationally and having a strong presence Pan India will attract global funders who are interested in India as a market, as India is a key market in CLimate both from Adaptation and mitigation sector. So CEEW is well positioned and can be the front runner in this space. CEEW has good linkages with stake level bodies in the energy sector. \n3. Sector focus- They are working in most sector and have good experience \nThey can represent India rather than operating internationally \n\n NaN 1. CEEW market perception mostly in the energy sector is quite good and specially engagement with govt agencies. It is known that it&amp;#x27;s not easy to work at speed when working in policy think tank space.\n2. CEEW were action oriented and were well perceived in the policy space- there were high chances of message reaching the right stakeholders: \n3. Strong networking and connections with the stakeholders (govt)\n\n NaN NaN Norwegian Embassy Retained 1. CEEW can influence legislation, government etc Food for thought for authorities. \n2. Ranked their Social capital and networking as high, technical knowledge is also very high \n3. Their staff are part of committees of GOI\n 1. Lack of business model and fundraising team in CEEW : Perception \n2. Domain experts should be able to convince the donor.\n3. Activity that created an impact in sector and presence of results framework and try to follow as much as possible - Impact- outcomes (medium)- tangible outputs- activities , and Norwegian stress upon the RF as part of project document. \n4. Grant management division look for some cross cutting issue in Project document and project activity will not have any\na) adverse impact on environment and\nb) promote gender equality,\nc) zero tolerance to corruption,\nd) not adverse impact wrt to human right,\n4. Knowledge products and academic outcomes are important to look at in a project document. Norway lays quite value to it. \nIf there is converge with what NE wants to do and CEEW activities then would like to do further engagement \n5. NE budget does not cover untied funds 1. Have been engaging with CEEW last 5-6 years. Working on the HFC project for the last 2-3 years\n2. Credibility, capacity and competence matter a lot\n3.The org should be established one and not to be involved in any controversy \n4. Norwegian also carry out mid and end term and this exercise will help to evaluate if the project achieved was was meant to- M&amp;amp;E \n5. Norwegian Also look for how a TT were able to influence policy, govt- \n6. CEEW has good performance in social, capital, networking and technical (domain experts) as well. \n\n 1. CEEW is Dissemination has been good, their website has lot of knowledge products and are doing a good job\n2. Fairly good at disseminating information and public \n3. No aware of their comm strategy but otherwise CEEW is good at presenting their finding and have utilized their website for advocating and publicizing their outputs \n 1. Being young is their strength, young team members come up with fresh ideas ad innovative ideas and are energetic\n2. Many employees are also part of govt committee and state level authoritie. \n3. Certain member of CEEW can be considered as second line of leader in terms of networking with the govt and other agency and its not AG driven only \n 1. Independence: CEEW works quite a lot independently and have noticed that not all CEEW activities are funding driven. They conceptualize the idea first and then look at the funding side. \n2. Norwegian have given flexibility to grantees on the research work done but donot try to influence much . Associating with CEEW have been independent so far, reported what were the finding\n NaN 1. On technology they have published paper such as on technology availability and what can be introduced \n2. CEEW is not specifically in technology development. \n3. Don&amp;#x27;t see them as part of tech at this moment. \n4. Facilitating a tech transition is something they are not into according to vivek, . Phase 2 has tech + policy 1. CEEW is young, young team members come up with fresh ideas ad innovative ideas and are energetic \n2. Well recognized and this lead to distinction of CEEW as lead org of energy and environment . \n3. Arunabha is very good at networking as well as other members of CEEW\n4. Overall Norwegian had a good experience of working with CEEW and find them as a good partner NaN NaN IKEA Foundation New 1. CEEW have good inroad with policy circle (govt) and their research, report and data are credible and is widely accepted within govt and other stakeholder\n2. Incubation space- CEEW don&amp;#x27;t have strength in this particular area and hence they have collaborated with like minded org like Villgro and trying to build inroads with the incubation ecosystem in India as well . Such as in Powering Livelihood, CEEW is trying to build a network with incubation space and banking sector. \n \n 1. IKEA scouts for aligned partnership or aligned project which matches the objectives of the foundation\n2. IKEA looks for in the partners (parameters)\na) Long term partnership and \nb) put lot of value in terms of simplicity , transparency and openness, \nc) value add to the end client. \nd) Kind of leaderships and kind of team engaged in the programme \n\n3. IKEA supports the Non profit in the process of their institutional development and IKEA looks at overhead cost \n4. Looks for outcome, Impacts in grant proposal- Impact assessment. IKEA user focused and looks for results that are being achieved at customer end for whom the programme is targeted at.\n5. CEEW ability to do advocacy with stakeholder/policy maker, govt and with other non profit players as well, they have neutral stand on the data they collect (additional credibility)\n6. IKEA doesn&amp;#x27;t look into the awards Integrated, independence 1. Partnership with CEEW past couple of years: CEEW programme aligned with IKEA portfolio of grant making objective\n\n2. CEEW goes beyond the contract agreement, CEEW is proactive in engagement with IKEA, engagement in advisory support groups, share learnings and organise convenings sessions around the learnings produced. IKEA looks more into the value proposition of the think tank not the market strategy, members working on ground is more important than virtual market/partnership engagement. \n3. CEEW builds the value proposition and reaches out, finds the synergies with the donor, this provides an encouraging environment to work and engage, this brings value for engagement. CEEW is transparent about the strengths and limitations they have, reports and data are credible so accepted with stakeholders, \n3. Impressed by the structure of CEEW and the value they offer, their track record was strong and appreciated what CEEW was able to achieve in small time span and established itself as a leading thought leader while being very cost efficient. 1. CEEW can do a lot more in terms of covenings front and knowledge sharing, play an anchor role \n2. CEEW has done some good work around COP 26 and advocacy around that. CEEW should function as the convener of the knowledge product or the insights they gather from different programme. \n 1.High degree of decentralization and empowerment within the employees\n2. Second line of leaderships are empowered to talk about their progress. \n3. In terms of succession planning and scaling and maintaining quality, CEEW needs to be conscious of who they want to plan their model of succession in terms of centralization and decentralization. \n4. It will be good if CEEW stick to decentralization in terms of their operation and scaling up \n 1. Good visibility in Indian ecosystem and internationally they have also started out, but they have a scope of building more as an entity\n2. Linear entity as compared to other Think Tanks and have delivered quality\n 1. IKEA looks more into the value proposition of the think tank not the market strategy, members working on ground is more important than virtual market/partnership engagement.\n2. CEEW builds the value proposition and reaches out, finds the synergies with the donor, this provides an encouraging environment to work and engage, this brings value for engagement. \n 1. IKEA see technology as a niche space- but how tech fits into market ecosystem, player like CEEW can build insight on-they can unfold narrative in between what is available and how to scale- This is the innovation they can bring \n NaN NaN Factors that would Stop Funding \n\n1. When org become overdependent on stream of financing or grant maker- CEEW can focus on diversifying their donor base- This helps the grantees to evolve their thinking and diverse their funding source.\n\n2. When TT Stop ideating on their own and follow typical market charms of defining larger goals and vision of projects which are uncoordinated which run completely on funding support. This creates a disconnect between what they want to achieve as an entity and kind of project they are rolling out- If there is a mismatch this limits the donors attraction towards the TT \n\n3. As donor IKEA would want the TT should have a sharper focus on the value proposition that they are building out. \n Good Energies Retained 1. CEEW find the solution and take it to higher level policy/decision makers\n 1. GE prefers to speak with the programme staff, since good energy is more focused on the progress of the project. Main point of contact should be the project team\n2. Institutional capacity building: Rarely gives undesignated untied core funding\n3. Resources- grantee should have the resources and skill and talents to attract fund. \n 1. Interacted with two different teams: Overall CEEW is timely and organized and submit thing on time, they donot drown GE with information and are precise \n2. Abhishek-interact on six month basis to review of the progress \n3. Finance team- bit of a hiccup with engagement \n4. Not important to have a think tank index, it could be taken as a sign of external evaluation \n 1. CEEW has more content or publish news than noise, post things with good content rather than amount \n2. They put on a mix of research content, org info or commentary of initiative and they are doing a good work this creates a fine balance\n3. Donot track no. of CEEW publication or ts scalability, but it should mirror the GE quest of change 1. CEEW can focus on the second level of leadership and Arunabha does most of the heavy lifting as a leader \n2. Risk- the second line of leadership even if they get recognition as a senior staff would be taking up duties and responsibilities without the title, pay and recognition of CEO which could lead to losing ambitious qualified staff. \n3. CEEW is fixated on a single leader and survival of the org is difficult. Leadership duties hence should be divided among other member as well. 1. Huge Dependence on govt on the FCRA funds and might lead to pulling out of significant funds, hence being truly independent can be certainly challenging. \n 1. CEEW is doing a job and their work on Climate is board. They need to think where they can have the most leverage and have the most benefit and not have a program in all states. \n NaN 1. Highly impressed with Arunabha research and leadership skills. The team in CEEW are highly action oriented,\n2. Produce good content of the work, use original data and able to explain the implication of the data to policy makers and general public and engaging with policy makers on the data produced\n3. They are organized and does on time submission \n\n \n 1, Challenges while engaging with finance team \n 1. a) GE focus on MEL framework: They measure Outcome- is it leading to some change such as policy adopted and is being implemented\nb) Tracks indicators from outcome and mostly track at an annual basis and output to track the progress (project) of the grantee. \nc) GE create impact table which defines the indicators and its outcomes with partners (co-creation)\nd) This is not an exercise which decides which partner will get the next funding, it is a collective guess at where change has happened in the system and to reach the ultimate goal. \n CIFF New 1. Political lever and leverage they are able to draw in terms of the policy space, is an attractive proposition\n2. Potential to collaborate with other Think tanks, competetors is absent and still in evolving stage\n3. Need to realise the importance of partnerships, acknowledged by Arunabha in a public event\n4. Convening power to bring partners to ISA - which has been claimed across many forums 1. CIFF does not do core funding, it is always programmatic grant. Even when we do regrant and fund continously a think tnak, our engagement fro funds is centred around programmtic funding predominantly.\n2. One of the reasons, orgs such as TERI used to have a tough adaptation strategy when they diversified their fundings etc. is something CEEW can learn from. Unlike TERI which is forced to be a lean organization. As donor community we have a dearth of global think tanks. CEEWs vision is good and they can be a global think tank. Currently we do not have think tanks working on sustainable finance, CIFF wants to do that for example. If CEEW aspires to be that, that is something that could really help the indian ecosystems.\n3. Funding and evidence independance without sustainable expansion can lead to similar stagnance TERI is facing today compared to their growth and development a decoade ago. WRT to CEEW, diversification is a key pivot at this critical juncture. Moving beyond the current Delhi centric, policy think tank narrative to sub national level work is key for supporting the 10 yrs of work and deepen their impact across India and the world. The domestic funding landscape is not mature enough which is a challenge\n4. CIFF as an international philanthropy wants to expand the domesting funding ecosystem by collaborating and collectively with the domestic philanthropies. \n5. CEEW needs to diversify their funding - too reliant on philanthropy - high reliance on foreign funding. 1. Shakthi regranted to CEEW more times in the past. WRT the cooling project CEEW was one of the few who had done work in this.\n2. CEEWs involvement with the drafting of the ICAP - India Cooling Action Plan, they fit right under our investments - as a think tank - specific component like R&amp;amp;D, Trainign and CB of the servicing sector - Important lever for us to engage with CEEW\n3. CIFF did not want to do multiple contracts and historically CEEW and TERI did not work together. It took a year to make everyone to work together but it was worth looking at the results. Arunabha has acknowledged the same, now CEEW is more open with working with other donors. CEEW agreeing to the same is important in continuing with them as a partner. They work on a broad range of areas but CIFF has been selective in areas. \n4. Current project engagement happens at the program level, Arunabha does not come in but for initial contracts/partnerships etc.. Our first conversation with him, he was punching above his weight, the conversation was arunabha centric, his acheivemetns and potential, very little scope for growth inside the organization. One senior peron moved last year. They need to create oppns for second round of leaders. This is something we look at as well.\n5. We do not converge on the Energy and Power priorities - CEEW focus on decentralised energy access, CIFF doesnt and Agri work is nascent and not substantial for CIFF to engage with. 1. Claiming attribution in the place of contribution - This is a generic positioning they take, they did play a role but other think tanks have a role to play. They have the convening power, so does TERI and CII. Its advisable from CEEW, they should draw a line on what they can claim and what is the larger ecosystem. 1. Second line of leadership, too much reliant on Arunabha. They had one second line person, but now they lost it and hence they need to look at it closely. \n2. CEEW has a sharp team, great analytical abilities, diversity in type of research, depth of research etc. Certainly credit to them 1. Contribution vs attribution, CEEW tries to project contribution as attribution. Example of this is the COP 26 claim when PM announced, CEEW is one of the many claimants to being the responsible for India&amp;#x27;s stance. It comes from the CEO and is trickled down to everyone there, this is something that they should be careful about. They need to realise what they can tag attribution or contribution for, after occupying 10-11 years in the space. Not all govt. work can be claimed attribution credit for. \n2. For a donor based in India think tank ratings, accreditation or certification does not matte, however for international donors and grant making agencies, rankings matter and some GMA&amp;#x27;s actively pursue it. 1. CEEW - Think tank in this sector especially, CEEW have grown very fast, in the ecosystem\n2. Very few think tanks cover the breadth and width of work in climate change, CEEW is one of them. \n3. CEEW brought a fresh approach and did not have baggage unlike TERI and DA.\n4. Being new was an advantage, the way they have grown as a global voice is commendable. \n5. CEEWs position is very hardlined just like govt of India, they should not been seen as invoicing govts opinion. Independent think tank should not just be a voice of the govt. Voicing India&amp;#x27;s strength and highlighting areas of improvement would be needed. Eg, Kigali Amendment - CEEW took a positiong to the same of Govt. of India despite being an Independent Think Tank.\n6. Political lever and leverage they are able to draw in terms of the policy space, is an attractive proposition NaN 1. CEEWs expertise on doing new areas of research and ability to take risks is good. \n2. The project on future of oil and gas in India is an example for this, CEEW is more flexible. Few niche areas of work as well they have their foot in\n3. They work across research, MEAL etc. across cross cutting domains such as agri, power, energy efficiency, transport, finance etc. and have a good reputation for their work. 1. Hope they do realize the importance of partnerships, They need to diversify their funding source. They are too reliant on philanthropic funding, for their long term sustainability. They do not get funding from govt so to ensure independence they have to make sure their funding is diversified.\n2. CEEWs position is very hardlined just like govt of India, they should not been seen as invoicing govts opinion. Independent think tank should not just be a voice of the govt. Voicing India&amp;#x27;s strength and highlighting areas of improvement would be needed\n3. Even withing the existing donor cohort, CEEW engages with approaches such as, &amp;quot;We are a leading think tank in India, in the Climate and Sustainability sector&amp;quot;, which is of no potential use for local donors or donors who are already engaging with them. Although they have earned it for sure, their branding must be more subtle. \n4. CEEW prefers getting programmatic grants and the past engagements suggest the same. Even their long relationship with Shakthi suggests the same. NaN CAF NaN 1. Ability to go out and network the external forces in play in the sector \n2. Arunubha as a leader has a national and international standing, positioning in the global leader community\n3. CEEW has staring convening and more civil society focused strategy and working closely with officials - based on the project CAF is engaging with CEEW\n4. Difficult to understand the CEEW deeper strategic thinking towards building network 1. Creating impact is important \n2. CEEW need to do ground implementation work more\n3. CAF and CEEW engagement in the region of UP- Opportunity to continue working with if they CEEW is able to reach the goal and able to show it\n 1. CAF prefer to engage with broader sector of staff- should be able to show diversity of talent, ability to nurture more talent and improve \n2. Engagement with CEEW is more with senior leaders\n3. CEEW has a deep technical knowledge, technical capacity and advocacy and conveneings with govt- This formed the basis of engagement with CAF \n4. CEEW is good at producing knowledge however needs to improve on the usage of the their knowledge products \n5. CEEW can build capacity to implement actions on ground\n6.

Ltd. (CMS) has commissioned this perception survey amongst the donor community — a key stakeholder for The Council — to understand its growth, impact, risks and vision for the future from their perspective. Over 90% of The Council’s funding being generated from third-party grants, dependent upon agreed project deliverables and cascading policy impact the engagement with the donor and grant making community becomes a critical pathway to measure, understand and improve going forward. As suggested in the ToR, CMS in this assessment would be utilising the following evaluation criteria: 1. Understanding Impact: Mapping The Council&amp;#x27;s research, advisory and outreach — and the impact The Council has had (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials. 2. Understanding Growth : Analysing perceptions around The Council’s growth being organic, planned or strategic; areas where we have surpassed expectations and where potential remains not fully realised. 3. Understanding Visibility : Analysing The Council’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset. 4. Understanding Risks : Analysing how donors perceive The Council’s governance as well as the risks that The Council must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, external environment or strategic directions. 5. Understanding Demand : Assessing what donors want and ﬁnding points of synergy between the two approaches without compromising on The Council’s well-earned independence 6. Understanding our value-proposition : Assessing perceptions on The Council’s values and priorities, including being integrated in analysis, international/global in outlook, independent of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy. 7. Benchmarking The Council against domestic and international competition. Overview of the organisation - The Council The Council has completed 10 years of existence in 2020. The organisation has evolved into a world class organisation putting people at the centre of world-class research. The journey of The Council ranges from the inputs to the 12th Five Year plan in 2011 to a study on the macroeconomic cost of inaction on water efﬁciency in 2020. Currently with over a decade of experience The Council currently has eight areas of focus which are 1. Energy Access 2. Renewables 4 --- Page 6 --- 3. Power Sector 4. Industrial Sustainability &amp;amp; Competitiveness 5. Low-Carbon Pathways 6. Risks &amp;amp; Adaptation 7. Technology, Finance &amp;amp; Trade 8. CEEW Centre for Energy Finance Some of the key achievements in a decade long journey are highlighted below 1. In the domain of energy access, extensive primary data, and engagement with the government led to the development of the Saubhagya scheme to achieve universal household electriﬁcation, impacting 125 million lives. 2. The Council has been futuristic in its outlook as well with its analysis for the Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce which contributed to setting the target of 175 GW of renewables by 2022. 3. It has been transforming markets for good with the establishment of the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance in 2019, the USD 3 million Powering Livelihoods initiative, a power sector project in Uttar Pradesh impacting 7.2 million consumers is an example of the same. 4. The Council has been pivotal in envisioning Mission 80-80-80. The mission aims to reduce air pollution by 80 per cent in 80 cities by 2027, when India will turn 80 as an independent nation and demand year-round focus on the quality of lives and livelihoods of 80 percent of Indians breathing unhealthy air. 5. Low-carbon pathways has been a focus of The Council in recent years, through complex modelling of over 200+ scenarios The Council managed to create the largest database on India&amp;#x27;s industrial GHG emissions: and are now contributing to drafting the National Hydrogen Mission as a foundation of low-carbon industrialisation. 6. The Council has been instrumental in building trust between governments thereby ensuring the agenda of climate change is advanced on the global level as well. With over a decade of experience across multiple areas of work The Council is in a transitional phase moving from transactional to transformational. Key Performance Indicators, Impact Metrics, and Gender KPIs There are several KPIs and Impact Metrics that CEEW uses to report on the aspect of their perf ormance. They have determined KPIs and metrics based on their own strategy and experiences. The KPIs are focused on criterias like reports published, media coverage and engagement with governments, gender structure etc. These are measurable values meant to demonstrate how effectively CEEW is achieving its key objective and also captures the essence of their overall success. These indicators and metrics can add substantial value to CEEW by collectively framing issues of importance, providing deep insights into project/programme performance, illustrating their strengths and weaknesses as well identifying opportunities for learning and improvement and lastly pointing towards their overall impact. Hence these KPIs and 5 --- Page 7 --- metrics can be used as a starting point towards identiﬁcation of the key indicators for the donor perception study. Furthermore it could be useful to benchmark with the widely used Think Tank evaluation index. To assess their overall performance and impact, they use 19 KPIs, impact metrics and gender KPIs to show the extent to which their work is getting on the radar which are as follows:- Key Performance Indicators The 19 KPIs are spread across the functions of Research, Government, Industry and Networks. 1. Research a. Complete several research projects and publications i. Number of research projects (completed or ongoing) = 278 (235) ii. Number of peer-reviewed publications = 212 (165) iii. Number of other publications = 240 (202) b. Establish CEEW’s reputation as a knowledge generator i. Instances of being tapped as a resource for ofﬁcial agencies (within and outside India) = 685 (527) c. Inﬂuence national and international negotiations through substantive inputs i. Instances of participation in international negotiations/summits = 65 (61) 2. Government a. Promote international cooperation i. Number of bilateral &amp;amp; multilateral initiatives promoted = 86 (80) b. Improve inter-state coordination i. Role in improving coordination in managing critical mineral resources = 30 (28) ii. Role in inter-state mechanisms for managing water resources = 37 (34) c. Develop integrated plans for energy, environment &amp;amp; water i. Number of energy, environment and water plans formulated = 30 (22) 3. Industry a. Increase investments in sustainable infrastructure i. Role in increasing investments (including R&amp;amp;D) in higher efﬁciency fossil fuels = 63 (58) ii. Role in increasing investments (including R&amp;amp;D) in renewable &amp;amp; clean technologies (including water) = 206 (169) b. Make India a hub for sustainability ﬁnance i. Role in clarifying energy-trade-climate linkages = 55 (51) ii. Role in developing instruments &amp;amp; governance of climate ﬁnance = 65 (52) c. Promote sustainable practices within industry i. Role in promoting energy &amp;amp; water efﬁciency, emission reductions, &amp;amp; pricing of natural resources= 190 (153) 4. Networks 6 --- Page 8 --- a. Increase engagement with scholars, industry &amp;amp; community, and facilitate interactions with ofﬁcial authorities i. Instances of increased transparency in &amp;amp; access to ofﬁcial data = 113 (99) ii. Number of thematic roundtables &amp;amp; conferences organised = 354 (292) iii. Participation in project-related non-CEEW events = 717 (496) b. Innovative use of new technologies &amp;amp; media i. Regular media coverage of CEEW activities = 1842 (1097) Impact Metrics The impact metrics of CEEW captures the quality of their work as well as reﬂects on the achievements beyond research that are needed to produce outcomes (real impact). These impact metrics emphasize on the fact that CEEW is focusing intently on improving the lives of the people, inﬂuencing policy and transferring knowledge via research towards the policy sector. Below are some examples of CEEW impact emerging from their ten-year journey ● Direct research and engagement with the government led to the development of the Saubhagya scheme, impacting 125 million lives. ● Indirectly impacted 400 million lives through our extensive work on improving the Ujjwala scheme for cooking energy fuel and saving INR 2400 crore annually through our work on the direct beneﬁt transfer scheme and the Give-it-up campaigns. ● Similarly, direct role in conceptualising and creating the Clean Energy Access Network, impacting 200 enterprises and unlocking at least USD 3 million in value. ● Research for the Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce and help to draft the Cabinet note directly resulted in the target of 175 GW of renewables by 2022, potentially creating a workforce of 330,000 people. ● At the state level, various recommendations have been accepted by the UP electricity regulator; billing and collection efﬁciency improvements will impact 7.2 million domestic consumers. ● The rooftop solar work has directly inﬂuenced the Delhi Net Metering Guidelines, indirectly inﬂuenced the central government’s Grid-Connected Solar Rooftop Programme (potentially creating 50,000 new jobs), and resulted in similar policies in Karnataka and other states. ● Within industrial sustainability, we are directly involved in drafting the National Hydrogen Mission. ● The estimates of energy and emissions from the industrial sector (the largest such database) resulted in a peer review of India&amp;#x27;s ofﬁcial GHG inventory and contribution to the Biennial Update Reports with robust estimates for 635 million tonnes of emissions from the industrial sector (~27 per cent of national emissions). ● Phasing down HFCs could avoid 3.86 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO 2 e) of emissions in India by 2050, contributing to avoiding up to 0.4°C of global warming by the end of the century. 7 --- Page 9 --- ● Research on low-carbon pathways is informing India&amp;#x27;s Mid-Century Strategy under the Paris Agreement. Gender KPIs There was also a huge focus given on the Gender KPIs to reﬂect on gender diversity within the institution. A wide set of key performance indicators (KPIs) was used to record the gender structure in CEEW, enabling them to analyze and monitor gender and diversity, which is an important step toward making real, demonstrable change. It also shows the good-faith effort to understand diversity in CEEW as well as focus attention on pay and representation in the all-important talent pipeline across CEEW. The measurement metrics of CEEW Gender KPIs centres around proportion, advancement, publication and representation of women at all levels—alongside disbursement of salary. Each provides a quantitative snapshot of CEEW current state on gender diversity as shown in the table below: Category KPIs Percentage (%) Institutional Diversity Percentage of female employee 46 Percentage of salary drawn by women 44 Percentage of women in leadership roles 36 Percentage of women in the CEEW Board 0 Research and Engagement Percentage of publications with female lead authors 39 Proportion of women on Panels at events organised by CEEW 32 Proportion of women in the CEEW Programmatic Advisory Groups 45 Communication Percentage of Opinion Pieces with female lead authors 50 Percentage of Opinion Pieces with female second authors 20 Percentage of quotes by female researchers 23 Summary of discussion with the Leadership Group @ The Council Below are the discussions conducted with key internal stakeholders 1. Mr. Karthik Ganesan and Mr. Mihir Shah - Partner engagement, Financing and communication strategy 8 --- Page 10 --- 2. Mr. Vikas Pandey - Financial processes, enabler functions and grant keeping approaches 3. Ms. Reman Singh - People Strategy and HR functions 4. Mr. Abhishek Jain and Mr. Vaibhav Chaturvedi - Partner engagement and Financing strategy 5. Dr. Arunabha Ghosh - Journey of The Council so far and Vision 2030 The discussions on high level strategy was with Dr. Arunabha Ghosh where the conversation was largely focused on the journey of The Council since inception and the future aspirations and directions as an institution. The discussions with research portfolio directors and key personnel assisted us with the understanding of the diverse operational frameworks, The Council deploys in delivering objectives of the engagement and eventually the impact for the sector, donors etc. The conversations with the enabler functions such as Finance and HR was extremely helpful in understanding the key strengths and challenges at The Council. Current engagements and approaches The research portfolio directors are the key engagement personnel for both grantee management and programme management across the grant making organisations and the donors. Engagement strategy is currently driven by individual portfolios and directors of the portfolio with the ﬁnance team coming in only for accounting and compliance requirements. The current approach is illustrated below. The Council as a front running climate action think tank occupies a unique market position, partnerships and people attracting major FCRA funding, owing to the limited competition, market positioning, capabilities etc. in the policy think tank space and the expertise and engagement space, The Council has built over the last 10 years. Most of the early grants The Council had secured could be attributed to The Council being a fresh voice in the sector, but now gradually the 9 --- Page 11 --- institutional capacities are being recognized by donors. Overall the current engagement strategy has evolved organically and is largely been driven by the leadership group. However going forward there is a conscious effort to move away from individuals to the institution. Challenges and limitations The key challenges and the limitations of the organizations are captured in this section. Concentration of FCRA funds The majority of the funding The Council currently handles are tagged through internations sources, FCRA classiﬁed/ With the recent restrictions to the FCRA rules, there are clear concentration risks and hence it is imperative that The Council looks to pivot towards domestic funds (untied and institutional per say) to offset the risk posed by high concentration of FCRA funds. Key Person Risk It was evident from the conversation with the Leadership group that the majority of the funding is managed by a siloed core hub at The council, most of the key engagements are front ended and attributed to the same core group as well. This was speciﬁcally highlighted during the conversation on the people strategy that The Council has planned going forward. Outcome based funding Outcome based funding has become more commonstance in the last few years, this has resulted in a lack of funding for institutional capacity building which is a challenge. Integrated communications Currently there are no standardized systems or processes in place for communications with donors. This has been raised by few donors as a pain point. The communications lead pointed to this as a deﬁnite challenge where there is lack of integrated communication at the organization level. Currently there are no strategic communication engagements with the donors as well. Opportunities and strengths Leadership The vision of the leader, Dr.Arunabha Ghosh is clearly a big strength for the organization. His thought leadership along with his vision for the sector as a whole brings in a lot of conﬁdence in The Council. This has been instrumental in The Council achieving the kind of success it has in the last 10 years. 10 --- Page 12 --- People People are the center of The Council, the form the core of the strategy of the organization. The biggest value proposition The Council has to offer is its people. The attrition rates are extremely low and the tenures of its employees are fairly long. The leadership and learning pathways are clearly deﬁned and a lot of young leaders are identiﬁed and nurtured. Transparency The Council has been very transparent in putting out their views, few people see The Council as close with the government but at the same time can criticize the government as well. This puts them in a unique position in the sector where they are sought after for both their ability to inﬂuence and critique the government. Futuristic outlook Identifying key issues for the future and investing in the same has been one of the key strengths of the organization. The Councils’ work in cooling and hydrogen is a good example of The Council shaping the agenda for the future by predicting key issues for the future and starting work in the same. Key questions for the donors The key questions for the donor that came from the conversations with the leadership group are as follows, please do note that these are not exhaustive and a larger framework has been detailed out later in the report. Project and programmatic funding come with its own set of constraints and challenges, The council is looking to understand how donors view these and the ways in which they differentiate the same. Measuring impact of a think tank&amp;#x27;s work is very difﬁcult, while outputs can be measured with preset metrics and deliverables, measuring the impact of those outputs is difﬁcult. From a donor perspective what are the impact metrics they look before deciding on an organization to fund is a question The Council is looking at. Climate change speciﬁc agendas are capturing the donors attention a lot these days, the kind of impact they look for when funding these projects is a key question for the donor. The leadership group at The Council has been crucial in building the relationships the organization currently has with the donors. This brings in key person risks which will have to be explored with the donors. The way the donors view the institutions versus the individuals is important to understand. The importance of gender based representation in the board and senior leadership from a donors’ perspective. The Council believes that transparency sets them apart from their peers, this was emphasized in almost every conversation we had with the leadership group. Is this something that the existing donors feel as well and how important is transparency for potential donors is a question the study 11 --- Page 13 --- hopes to answer. Although the relationship with existing donors is good, it is important to understand how many of them act as brand ambassadors for The Council where they promote The Council while engaging with other players in the ecosystem. This point also leads to the question of the current engagement mechanisms and the way donors view the same, points of concerns and issues the donors might have for The Council. The Council has almost doubled its numbers in the last year, the existing donors might view this as a negative as the increased numbers might reduce the focus on existing donors, can have some implications on the timeliness leading to cost extensions etc. Expectations from the study The key expectations from the study the leadership team at The Council has is summarized below. Baseline of awareness amongst donors The leadership team indicated that the current awareness levels amongst the donors both domestic and international has to be assessed as part of the study. This includes awareness amongst existing donors, key sectoral players and the potential donors. Perception of The Council amongst existing donors Understanding how the existing donors view The Council is an expectation from the study, these will be captured along the dimensions of Demand, Value proposition, Impact, Risk, Growth and Visibility. Identiﬁcation of potential donors Identiﬁcation of potential donors at three levels as listed below. 1. Donors who are looking to build institutions/bet big on key sustainability issues 2. Donors who are engaged with public policy at strategic level 3. Donors who can see that The Council can convert concept to idea to impact 12 --- Page 14 --- Study Framework The proposed study framework effectively encompasses the six major evaluation criteria presented by The Council as a part of the studys’ TOR. The Framework intends to bring together the aspects of secondary landscaping exercise to address key components of the study such as understanding the sectoral perception, positioning and aspects of institutional benchmarking in terms of engagement, processes, impact and sustainability. The second integrating component would interject the aspects of donor perception on The Council and vice versa and insights coming in from the primary interactions (KIIs with donors) and self assessment surveys (perception surveys) with the existing and potential donor communities. Donor perception frameworks Given the theoretical expectations from the study and integrating with the key discussions and insights generated from the interaction with the leadership group, LG @ The Council, we have picked up the nuances of the key indicator sets we would focus on during the donor perception mapping exercise. Guiding principles for the framework in our approach are majorly layered upon, the Engagement Sustainability Index, USAID 1 designed and deployed essentially to measure the strength and overall viability of development and policy research and implementation institutions. The framework networks seven different dimensional levers to advise on the engagement ﬁdelity and perception. 1 The 2016 CSO Sustainability Index for Asia - https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/ﬁles/documents/1868/2016-Asia-CSOSI-Report.pdf 13 --- Page 15 --- 1. Legal Environment: Factors shaping the legal environment; ease of registration; legal rights and conditions; and the degree to which laws and regulations regarding taxation, procurement etc. 2. Organizational Capacity : Sector’s ability to engage in constituency building and strategic planning, as well as internal management and stafﬁng practices within the institution etc. 3. Financial Viability - Factors inﬂuencing the ﬁnancial viability of the institution include the state of the economy, the extent to which fundraising, independence etc. are being nurtured in the research and culture etc. 4. Advocacy : Inﬂuencing public policy, the prevalence of advocacy across sectors, at different levels of government, as well as with the private sectors 5. Service Provision : Service provision dimension, the extent to which the institution recover costs and receive recognition and support from the donors, local governments etc. for these services is also considered 6. Infrastructure: Prevalence and effectiveness of the partnerships with competitors, governments, resource organisations, delivery organisations, implementation organisations, PR etc. 7. Public Image: Extent and nature of the media&amp;#x27;s coverage of institutions, the awareness and willingness of donors, grant making agencies, governments to engage, as well as the public&amp;#x27;s knowledge and perception of the sector as a whole. The adjacent framework critical for our design is the Think Tank Business Model 2 - An approach largely used by the think tanks across the globe to deliver value to stakeholders, entices funders to pay for value, and converts payments to research with the potential to inﬂuence policy. Key components of the proposed Go To Market Strategy are listed below for reference. 1. Value Proposition: Uniqueness of products and research that think tanks offer to their clients. Clients perceive the usefulness of the products and services to solve their problems, needs, and other concerns. Value proposition deﬁnes a think tank’s comparative advantage to other think tanks or organisations. 2. Core Business Activities: Manifestation of the work that think tanks perform to make their business models run successfully 3. Governance: Mechanisms and roles involved to provide oversight of the strategy and operations of every entity of an organisation by its governing body. 4. Funding Model: Sources and structure of ﬁnance that match an organisation’s vision and objectives. In particular, it makes reference to the “methodical and institutionalised approach to building a reliable revenue base to support an organisation’s core programmes and services aligned with their visions, mission and values. 5. Leadership: Style and approach of day-to-day management and administration; how think tanks could structure their leadership to guide the organisation in the fulﬁllment of its mission 2 UNRAVELLING THINK TANKS’ BUSINESS MODELS - https://onthinktanks.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Business-Models-On-Think-Tanks-Exchange.pdf 14 --- Page 16 --- 6. Stafﬁng: Approach to setting up of tools and strategies to attract suitable, experienced and well-educated staff, retention, motivation, growth, rewards etc. 7. Financial Management: Managing the stream of costs and revenues; costs encompasses the ﬁnancial support needed to perform all the elements of a think tank’s business model, such as the core activities, stafﬁng, etc., and revenues refer to income as a consequence of products’ sale. 8. Communication Strategy: Plan, programme, and activities designed by think tanks to reach their donors, beneﬁciaries and other stakeholders Effectively deducting the objectives of the study alongside the expectations and needs that arose from the key discussions, we propose the following sequential indicator framework to capture donor perception across the six levers, i.e., growth, impact, risks, demand, visibility and value proposition. Approach to the study A brief overview of the methodology for the perception survey among the donor community is presented below. CMS is proposing to utilise a multifaceted approach to study to assist The Council with critical outputs from the study to reinforce their 2030 Vision, Mission and Objectives. 15 --- Page 17 --- The approach for the study will have 2 critical components, Component A where donor level deep dives with 2 critical cohorts would be planned and executed. The Cohort A - Donors who have either worked with The Council in the past or are currently working with The Council would be sampled for interaction to capture and interpret the key donor perceptions. A mutually convened sample of donors and grant making organisations will form the basis of Cohort 2, who would be approached for the study to understand the perception of The Council and the key think tanks in the sector capable of delivering to their investments and cascading impact effectively. The structured interactions with Donors would be evaluation panel driven consultations with partners (stratiﬁed by categories) to assess The Council performance across growth, value creation, impact. demand and the associated risks. Pivoting from here on, the Partner Deep Dives (Case studies) with a subset of partners to evaluate the value creation and partnership maturity, quality and implications of the outputs generated etc. Depending on the extent of information shared and extending to track sectoral needle movements and donor impact landscape post association of The Council, attribution and contribution assessment. The proposed Component B is a Sectoral Landscaping and Institutional Comparative Positioning exercise, which majorly involves secondary landscaping research exercise to design, develop and execute the framework for the study along with a sector level comparative benchmarking of key perceptions, positioning, people and outputs delivered by The Council. Through the Component B, the activities would cascade into capturing and understanding the key challenges and opportunities in policy research and think tank landscape along with Institutional comparative positioning with international and national think tanks aligned with The Councils’ business strategy. In addition to the proposed exercise, sector level expert consultations would take place to deep dive on sectoral needs, demand supply, expectations from think tanks and speciﬁcally The Council, aspects of market, visibility etc. Component C overhauls the synthesising the outputs of Components A&amp;amp;B strategically to input effectively into The Councils’ Strategy, Vision, Mission and Objectives to 2030 and beyond. 16 --- Page 18 --- Sampling Methodology Overall approach to sampling for the study is centered around the donor level interactions. The table below summarises the approach to sampling for the proposed study. The overall summary of donors S.No Description Tools Criteria Stakeholders Sample 1 Structured Interactions with Key Stakeholders (Donors &amp;amp; Grantees) 2 Cohorts 1. Existing and engaging donors - 60% (15 Nos) 2. Potential sectoral donors - 40% 3 (10 Nos) Self-assessment tool (Mixed-Method), KIIs/IDI Case studies Approach 1 ● Level 1 - At this level the donors from all three categories of New(6), Retained(6) and Old(3) are chosen. The numbers are purposively arrived at. ● Level 2 - At this level Focus areas wise representation is ensured to make sure all focus areas are adequately represented. ● Level 3 - Within the focus areas , Value and the number of times the donor has engaged with CEEW is used to arrive at the ﬁnal list of donors. Approach 2 Purposive Sampling from the 25 shortlisted list of donors Donors and Investors 54 Nos (Self Assessment Tool) 25 Nos (KIIs / IDIs) * 15 Cohort 1 * 10 Cohort 2 5 deep dive case - studies 2 Sectoral Consultations with Experts Expert Consultations ● Experts could have representation from the ecosystem such as policy makers, domain experts, donors, market leaders etc. The Council Team Partners 3 - 4 Expert consultations Tools and stakeholders A structured self assessment tool would be developed - majorly comprising closed ended rubric scale perception tracking questionnaire mapping critical indicators across growth, demand, impact, visibility, value proposition and risk. The IDI/KIIs would be a semi structured questionnaire with some contextualised approach to individual donors sampled across the Cohort 1 &amp;amp; Cohort 2. From the insights generated through 3 The potential sectoral donors, philanthropies and grantees (40% - Cohort 2) will be shortlisted in consultations with our internal investment committee and The Council while approaching for data collection. However, this cohort mobilisation will be front ended by internal investment champions from CMS. 17 --- Page 19 --- the Cohort 1 conversations, 5 select number of donors would be shortlisted in consultation with The Council for a deep dive case study exercise, which would provide an in depth understanding of the impending engagement, critical factors that has fostered the relationship, key transactions and impact created by the engagement etc. Cohort 1 - Approach For sampling of cohort 1 , details of donors The Council has engaged with for the last ﬁve years (2016-21) was used. The donors were classiﬁed as follows. Type of Donors New Donors who have started their engagement with The Council post 2018 for the ﬁrst time and currently have an active engagement with The Council. These are the partners who do not have a closed project with The Council at this point. Old Donors who are currently not engaging with The Council but have engaged in the past with The Council fall in this category. Retained Partners who have funded multiple projects for The Council, and currently have active projects with The Council are classiﬁed as retained partners. Below is the list of donors split across the above categories. 18 --- Page 20 --- Donor details starting - 2016-17 Current Past New Retained Old Bloomberg ExxonMobil ACIAR CAF GIZ Bloom Energy CIFF Good Energies CAG EdelGive Hewlett CPCA European Climate Foundation IISD CSIRO Good Ventures MacArthur DST IKEA Foundation NRDC DST, IIM(A) LBNL Shell Foundation Foreign &amp;amp; CW Ofﬁce Lighthaus BV SSEF Forum for the Future New Venture Fund UNEP IASS Oak Foundation ICMR SED Fund IIT Madras Stiftelsen GCF INSIRE/MOEFCC IIT Delhi Niti Aayog Ministry of Mines Norwegian Ministry ODI Oxfam India PDA Power for All REN21 TERI The Nature Conservancy (TNC) TWAS UNDP United Nations foundation, GACC Vijayavahini Villgro World Bank WRI 19 --- Page 21 --- Analysis of existing donors The below table shows the split of the donors and projects classiﬁed across the above categories.

Bloomberg Cohort 2 - Approach Arunabhas’ vision for the sector and the institution From the conversations with the leadership group at The Council we understand that The Councils’ vision is to ● Become a world class institution in data, outreach and analysis of global signiﬁcance with a focus on impact at scale, 23 --- Page 25 --- ● Move sustainability from the “Margin” to “Mainstream” by working across the themes of policy, technology, ﬁnance and behaviour to move from a policy advisory to a mainstream economy. This requires working with donors that can make this journey from transactional to transformational a reality betting on the institutional capacities of The Council and investing in the same. This vision of The Council, requires donors who work in domains of sustainability across the spectrum of food, agriculture, water, energy etc. With the impending risk of the new FCRA laws it is paramount that The Council looks at local donors who can be a part of The Councils’ journey going forward. These are donors who would ● Invest in the institution development of The Council and build institutional capacities of the organization. ● Invest in integrated ideas and do not restrict their funds to a speciﬁc sector/domain, make big bets to achieve transformation across the larger ecosystem ● Support linkages of markets within and outside the country. Landscaping the climate ﬁnancing Global Landscaping Secondary research was conducted to gain an overview of the major waves of investments in the climate sector. The research component was done to capture the data available on the primary ﬁnancing supporting climate resilience activities. Our sources include reports generated by bodies such as Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) 4 , International Energy Agency (IEA) 5 etc. Overview and key ﬁndings ● Renewable energy remains the primary destination sector for global climate ﬁnance tracked in the 2017/2018 Landscape , representing USD 337 billion annually, or 58% of global climate ﬁnance. ● 53% of tracked private renewables ﬁnancing ﬂowed to solar PV , while wind accounted for an additional 40% . ● Financing for low-carbon transport is increasing rapidly. Average annual ﬁnance to transport projects rose by 54% from its 2015/2016 level to USD 141 billion in 2017 and 2018. This was primarily led by rapid increase in the adoption of electric vehicle ● Annual climate ﬁnance ﬂows rose to USD 579 billion , on average, over the two-year period of 2017/2018, a USD 116 billion (25%) increase from 2015/2016 ● Private ﬁnance reached USD 326 billion on average annually in 2017/2018, accounting for the majority of climate ﬁnance, at around 56%. 5 World Energy Investment 2020 https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020 4 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-ﬁnance-2019/ 24 --- Page 26 --- ● Domestic, bilateral, and multilateral development ﬁnance institutions (DFIs) accounted for the majority of public ﬁnance ● Around 80% of all public energy R&amp;amp;D spending was on low carbon technologies – energy efﬁciency, CCUS, renewables, nuclear, hydrogen, energy storage and cross-cutting issues such as smart grids. ● Push for electro-mobility and cleaner car s boosted overall corporate energy R&amp;amp;D spending. Building on the literature review undertaken, we identiﬁed that there was an increase in the ﬁnancing for renewables , a surge in the ﬂows towards low-carbon transport , a strong upwards trend in public ﬁnancing for adaptation , and early signs of mainstreaming across a larger set of private ﬁnancing institutions. Landscape of Sustainable development investments in India Sustainable development investment space in India takes place across diverse avenues and the dominant routes are the government investments, global foundations and foundations and CSR arms of Indian corporations. The focus areas of the CEEW portfolio are cross mapped against the sustainable investment portfolio on the aforementioned channels. Domestic Investments-CSR and Corporate foundations Individual Philanthropists - High Networth Individuals Sustainable Finance - Institutional investors Research component Five percent of the total CSR expenditure for that ﬁnancial year or ﬁfty lakh rupees . Environmental Sustainability 450 Million USD (25% of annual spending- USD 1.78 Billion) 480 Million USD (12% of 8.49B USD) as spending goes to Sustainable development) as shown in the below graph 7.2 Billion USD (INR 52000 Crores) Green Bonds as of 2020 Overall spending USD 1.78 Billion (INR 13220 Crores) 4 Billion USD(INR 30000 Crores) in the year 2020 The funding for sustainable development in the Indian landscape as of 2020 is at USD 8.13 Billion. Sustainable ﬁnance is having a larger pie of attributing USD 7.2 Billion, Individual philanthropic contributions for sustainable development of USD 480 Million and CSR contributions for sustainable development would be USD 450 Million. 25 --- Page 27 --- Investment Lens by Impact Philanthropists, CSR and Corporate Foundations Looking at the above graph, the sustainable development investments by family philanthropists, has a contribution 12% among the overall investments. Azim Premji Foundation(APF) is one of the highest funded philanthropies, it works with the principle of addressing the challenges of vulnerable communities. APF funds only the environmental initiatives in addressing the challenges of small marginal and landless farmers, pastoral and tribal communities. Another major philanthropy is Rohini Nilekani Foundation, it funds institutions Arghyam, Ekstep and Pratham, whereas Arghyam is the only organisation that directly works on environmental initiatives focused on promoting clean drinking water and water conservation initiatives. As shown in the above graph, the potential for research and development for sustainable investment with the family philanthropy are seen in the lenses of vulnerable populations resolving their access to energy, meeting their livelihood needs and water conservation practices. The statistics pu t out by Foundational Maps by Candid 6 provided us with a glimpse of the ﬂow of funds across various environmental sectors in India. Our ana lysis of the funding mainly focuses on six types of support strategy namely Research &amp;amp; Evaluation , Capacity-Building and Technical Assistance, Network-Building and Collaboration, Policy, Advocacy and Systems Reform, Participatory Grantmaking, Outreach and General Support from the year 2017 to 2019 speciﬁc to CEEW core areas. 6 The R&amp;amp;D analysis includes the funding only from Corporate Giving Program https://maps.foundationcenter.org/home.php 26 --- Page 28 --- Below are some key ﬁndings:- ● The overall value of grant from 2017 to 2019 for different support strategies towards the sector of Climate Change and Natural Resources (Energy Efﬁciency, Fossil Fuels, Renewable Energy, Land Resources and Air Quality etc) accounted for USD 55.8 Million . ● Funding towards the sector of Natural Resource outpaced Climate Change receiving almost USD 55.4 Million with a total of 230 funders out of the total funding from 2017 to 2019 ● However, as per the Foundational Maps estimates, the funding value decreased by USD 11.3 Million from 2017/2018 to 2018/2019, mainly due to low ﬂow of funds towards Natural Resources ● There was an increase in the funding towards Climate Change related activities from USD 315,578 in 2017/18 to USD 708,494 in 2018/19 ● Based on the data provided, more than 50% of the total funding went towards Policy, Advocacy and Systems Reform support strategy estimating to almost USD 31.6 Million out of USD 55.8 Million ● Out of the total grant value across the Natural Resources and Climate Change sector, Capacity-Building and Technical Assistance accounted for USD 11.9 Million, followed by Outreach (USD 9.8 Million) , Network-Building and Collaboration estimated to USD 4.6 Million and lastly Research and Evaluation received USD 4 Million. The table 1 demonstrates the top funders and their grant estimate from 2017 to 2019 in support of Climate Change or Natural Resources Sector and also categories the grant funding by subject area. S.No Funder Subject Area Grant Value 1 Axis Bank Limited Natural Resources, Sustainable Development (Dev) and Rural Dev USD 14.7 Million 2 Reliance Industries Limited Natural Resources, Rural Dev and Agriculture, ﬁshing and forestry USD 2.7 Million 3 Pidilite Industries Limited Natural Resources and Rural Dev, Science and Agriculture, ﬁshing and forestry USD 2.6 Million 4 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited Natural Resources and Community &amp;amp; Economic Dev USD 2.2 Million 5 Indian Oil Corporation Limited Natural Resources, Health and Education USD 2.1 Million 6 Aurobindo Pharma Ltd Natural Resources and Rural Dev USD 2 Million Our analysis of the Indian R&amp;amp;D funding reveals that there was an overall increase in the ﬂow of funds towards the Climate Change Sector. Even though the Natural Resource Sector remained the 27 --- Page 29 --- main area of funding, there was a downward trend of funding observed from 2017-2019. The funding towards Policy, advocacy and systems reform was the highest followed by Capacity-building and technical assistance strategy. Lastly, Axis Bank Limited, Reliance Industries Limited etc emerged as the top funders during the period of 2017 to 2019. Thus this gives us an overall picture on funding for R&amp;amp;D related activities and also some insights towards sector wise ﬂow of funds as well as the trend and opportunities in India. The Council is clearly positioned to take advantage of this movement, the recent inception of the centre of Energy Finance which has been deepening markets, increasing transparency, and attracting capital to clean energy sectors in emerging economies since 2019, Designing the Common Risk Mitigation Mechanism to unlock ﬁnances for renewables and designing a multisectoral framework to compare and recommend mitigation instruments for India’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Scaling up India’s renewable energy (RE) targets to 175 GW of renewables by 2022 are some of the other initiatives The Council has undertaken in the last one year in the domain of renewables. Program funding vs Institutional funding by CSR arms and domestic corporations CSR funding in the Indian landscape was USD 2.5-3 billion (INR 167-201 billion) from around 16,0001 eligible companies, However the strategic alignment of CSR investments are limited to the following three key aspects. ● CSR funds need to be complying to CSR rules and activities prescribed by Schedule 7-Companies Act (Contribution to PM CARES/PM Relief fund, Swach Bharat, Promoting education, healthcare, skill development among differently abled, vulnerable populations, protection of national heritage, environmental sustainability and others) ● Designing and delivering programs meeting their proportioned annual budget and showcasing visible outcomes in short gestation ● Post pandemic, the CSR managers are keen to focus on vulnerable populations on livelihoods, healthcare and access to social protection ﬁnancial services Between 2015 to 2020, the spending from CSR activities is estimated to be INR 79,293 Crores and the environmental sustainability spending is around 8% for environmental sustainability. The average spending on CSR activities per organisation in the last 5 years ranges from INR 65 L to INR 75 L per year. With the new CSR rules, there can be multi year CSR investments are allowed and ﬁrms are allowed to set off surplus spending upto 3 years. Though CSR funds seem to be available consistently every year, there is a strategic misalignment, especially as they are funding to short term projects or programs but not evidence generation to inform policy, transformative causes or developing research institutions. Discussions with the sectoral experts depict &amp;gt;90% of the research arrangements are driven b y contractual service agreements for formative or summative programmatic research and CSR portfolio management but rarely entertain grant making approaches. 28 --- Page 30 --- Accessing larger pool of Sustainable Finance through Stewardship Though the CSR funds and Impact philanthropy are having limited access to investments and research opportunities for sustainability development initiatives, there is wider opportunity for research and development in sustainable ﬁnancing instruments. 1. Policy inﬂuencing and sectoral guidance: WBCSD Cement Sustainability initiative: Major companies from the cement sector and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) launched the Indian Cement Sector SDG Roadmap at an event organized by WBCSD and UN Global Compact Network India (UN GCNI). Cement companies like Ultra Tech Cement, Ambuja Cements, ACC and others have actively taken part in reduction of carbon emissions, improving energy efﬁciency. Ultra tech Cement raised 400 Million$ to reduce 22% of CO2 emissions per tonne . There is a wider opportunity for Cement companies to provide sectoral guidance on low carbon pathways. The more organisations invest on initiatives on improving energy efﬁciency, accessing renewable energy and bringing in recycled materials for production. 2. Widening access to ﬁnance among banking institutions: SBI has raised 650 Million$ through Green bonds. SBI has isted green bonds of USD 100 million under its USD 10 billion global medium term note programme on India INX’s Global Securities Market Green Platform (GSM). 3. This is a strong statement for the banking and ﬁnancial services sector to design ﬁnancial products that promote an objective to create a positive impact on the environment and this transaction is yet another step as part of our sustainability journey. 4. Inﬂuence of locomotive sector on Zero net emissions: Indian Railway Finance Corporation has listed its foreign currency bonds and green bonds on NSE IFSC&amp;#x27;s debt securities market platform. The company has raised a capital of $2.25 billion by issuing bonds in different tranches under the $4 billion global medium-term note and $500 million green bonds programmes. The CO2 emissions per net-tonne-km for diesel locomotive in India is 9.51 grams and it intends go Zero CO2 emissions by 2030 5. There is a wider scope for pursuing low carbon pathway and access to ﬁnance among Metro rail corporations and various private locomotive companies in the country and abroad. Especially with the investments of Japan and foreign institutional investors and the sustainable development goals, there is ample of research and development opportunities in both inﬂuencing sectoral sustainable development investments and policy level changes 6. Aluminium Stewardship Initiative : ASI has a mission to foster greater responsibility in aluminium production and supply chains. There are many Aluminium manufacturing companies like Hindalco, Qatar aluminium and others in their supply chain actively contributing to the sustainability initiative in the manufacturing sectors. 7. Extended Producer Responsibility-Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR is the commitment made by a producer to facilitate a reverse collection mechanism and recycling 29 --- Page 31 --- of end of life, post-consumer waste. The objective is to circle it back into the system to recover resources embedded in the waste. In summary, there is no direct reference from the Indian sustainability landscape to capture from the research portfolio investments and outcomes, however, there is a resounding research and development opportunities in providing insightful guidance in designing ﬁnancial products and services. Accordingly, there is a wider opportunity to inﬂuence access to ﬁnance, promoting sectoral initiatives and policy level changes through sustainable ﬁnancing products in India. Philanthropy in India There is also a clear movement towards a more structured approach with involvement of a lot more stakeholders. Given the context of the Indian growth story, the nature of philanthropy has changed as follows Rise in the quantum of funding Indian domestic philanthropy has changed quite a bit in recent years, in terms of absolute numbers the funding has grown from INR 12.5K crore in 2010 to INR 55K crore in 2018. This has been predominantly driven by landmark commitments by a few Indian and Indian-origin families which includes Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Dr. Romesh and Kathleen Wadhwani, Azim and Yasmeen Premji, and Nandan and Rohini Nilekani. These families have joined the Giving Pledge as well. Move towards bolder issues and a structured approach to funding There is a clear movement towards a more structured approach with involvement of a lot more stakeholders. There is a gradual shift towards outcome based approach of giving with more niche areas being covered. Below chart details the same. Stronger support towards the ecosystem There is an increasing trend of new roles and actors entering the philanthropic sector as service providers. Below diagram captures the various services and support functions that have emerged in the last decade to support the philanthropic ecosystem. 30 --- Page 32 --- Following are the areas from the perspective of The Council where there is scope of engagement. 1. Research and advisory - In terms of research and advisory services, assisting philanthropists to take an evidence based approach to deploying funds has been a key value add. 2. Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning - Reporting is another key area where a lot of movement has happened , this has resulted in promotion of a culture of monitoring, evaluation and learning across the sector, which results in better donor reporting. 3. Collective, visioning, giving and learning - Mobilizing multiple stakeholders towards collaborative giving , resulting in the emergence of investment-ready solutions for large-scale impact. Potential fundraising strategy and Cohort 2 shortlisting Exploring strategies for building institutional capacities for high quality research, better communication and increased sources of funding, increased human capital, enable the environment for collaboration, clear paths for successful revenues, value delivery and cultivation 31 --- Page 33 --- of trust it emerges that one needs to have an innovative model/approach to overcome the numerous predicaments. With the changing funding landscape and limited means of communication with the donors/stakeholders there needs to be a development theory on how an institution accomplishes its mission. Given the aforementioned context, adapting to new strategic approaches to identifying funders, entering into sequential funding / long term funding investment agendas etc. seems inevitable and worth studying for. The strategies should reﬂect the management hypothesis about what the stakeholders want, how they want it, and how a think tank can use its resources to the best to meet those needs, get paid for doing so and achieve its mission. Secondary research suggests that there are several adaptable strategies and conceptual approaches for an institution to be successful and sustained over time. Some of these are mentioned below:- 1. Philanthropic Houses / HNIs / Diaspora led Funding Based on the key decision making elements like motivation of the donor, methods deployed to translate the giving intent and the core activities being funded, potential donors for this approach could be shortlisted. Eg. Rohini Nilekani (from the perspectives of IIHS, Arghyam, Takshashila Institute etc.), Luis Miranda (from the perspectives of CCS) who have funded think tank institutional development and the cause. 2. Collaborative / Consortium led approach Collaborative philanthropy – Here the focus is on philanthropist and philanthropic organisations (as per aforementioned disaggregation and ﬁltering) that rally around a shared idea, which results in their not only pooling resources but also thinking about how to formulate integrated solutions to problems at scale. Eg: India climate collective, AVPN, EDGE Funders etc. Corporates collaboratively committing to a cause - Tapping into corporate sustainability collaborative channels, where the corporations and the associated value chain is collaborating for a speciﬁc sustainability driver / actor is a potential area where the sectoral needs and advancements overlap with the regulatory direction, compliance and market growth. Eg The Climate Pledge Fund constituted by Amazon and the value chain players 3. Research Consortiums and platform approach In this approach, the potential of The Council to form the intellectual core of the sustainability councils and key research consortiums. he core functions of the consortiums, membered by think tanks and research institutions committed to providing policy advice, key sectoral research, evidence generation across priority interdisciplinary and 32 --- Page 34 --- multidisciplinary sectoral and thematic areas, policy to action / evidence to action strategy, business modelling and creation of knowledge assets / public goods. Eg. IDRC, UKRI, SSRC etc. Philanthropic Houses / HNIs / Diaspora led Funding Key decision areas for donor groups In this section we look at the key decision making elements that philanthropists, HNIs, Diaspora led funders look at across various components and the larger proﬁle of donors and grant making organisations that suits the requirements of ‘The Council’. Motivation for the donor Below are the key decision making elements for a donor organisation looking from a lens of the primary motivations for the decision to fund. These choices are not exhaustive, there are several other points on which decisions might need to be made, and many more choices available to the donor. The extreme choices discussed and choices available in the continuum of the two extremes aren’t the only ones available. In the context of the requirements highlighted by ‘The Council’, philanthropists, philanthropic houses, HNIs, diaspora led funders etc. falling under the junction of the below decision choices would ﬁt best. These donors proﬁled since funding out of choice have more ﬂexibility in their approach, with the recent trend of funders taking more ownership of their interventions ‘The Council’ is well positioned to leverage funding for research and design and not just implementation 33 --- Page 35 --- as is the case with funders who support causes. Sustainability is an overarching theme in all the work ‘The Council’ undertakes, at times this requires working on complex nexus of sustainability issues, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary hypothesis etc. which might put the research and funding needs at cross hairs with national priorities aimed at economic development and with the key stakeholders, governments and quasi-governments in the ecosystem, hence a funder who is willing to fund these tough grounds is extremely crucial. Methods for translating philanthropic intent Fig. X represented below, depicts the key decision points that donors have to take on the various methods on how intent gets translated into a strategy and approach to work. In order to achieve the larger goals of ‘The Council’ when it comes to the methods of delivering philanthropic intent below is the combination of methods that are required. Transformative funding is key for realising the vision ‘The Council’ has for 2030, funding causes and work that creates long term conditions such that the number of people needing curative help decreases. ‘The Councils’ key strength coming from the key discussions has been the young , dynamic and diverse team. It is important for the potential donors to be comfortable working in this environment that would foster new ideas, perspectives and criticisms. Lastly it is paramount that the funder is patient with the capital employed and looks at building expertise in the long term. 34 --- Page 36 --- Core activities By core activities we refer to the actual activities that the strategies translate to. 35 --- Page 37 --- For ‘The Council’ to make its’ vision a reality the potential donors, drive focus on funding behavioral change in turn focus on improving the capacities within the organization. The potential funding approaches earmarked to building the institutional capacity and institutional development holistically for The Council rather than speciﬁc programs, with a high degree of ﬂexibility. Below table summarises the proﬁle of the philanthropists that ﬁts into the overall vision ‘The Council’ has. 36 --- Page 38 --- 37 --- Page 39 --- Rohini Nilekani Foundation Philanthropy perspective: The philanthropy is keen to invest in collaborations among institutions, ideas and individuals delivering path-breaking work that promotes a strong samaaj with ethical leadership, a sense of urgency and the courage to learn. Accordingly, philanthropy believes and works for the revival of communities and builds capacity to meet their functions and duties towards their progress. They invest in institutions that co-create and enable governance among the community institutions. Funding background: They invested in institutions across Climate and Biodiversity, with a grant of ₹ 14.51 Crores in the ﬁnancial year 2020 to 2021 and ₹ 15.34 Crores in the ﬁnancial year 2020 to 2021. They fund collaboratives, research and data centric organisations and implementation agencies on sustainable water solutions - Arghyam( ₹ 150 Crores), Climate collaboratives (ICC), ATREE( ₹ 50 Crores), and Biodiversity conservation measures-Elephant habitat protection, Bangalore Environment Trust and many more organisations. Opportunities ahead: The funding principle and community centric solutions would be critical to understand the scope of work with this philanthropy. They work closely with various government agencies and ensure to implement sustainable solutions to the last mile. The Council could work across landscape research on pan country level environmental challenges especially inﬂuencing government agencies both in policies and in implementation. The policy to action would be possible working with various government agencies and could happen the other way the actioned activities could be studied to be translated into policy level discussions among bureaucrats and government agencies. Potential limitations The funding may be tied to speciﬁc research outputs addressing the critical problem statements presented or the solutions that could be implemented. In summary they may fund without FCRA compliance but they may have equivalent requirements and could be an untied fund and they entirely depend on contractual obligations. Collaborative Approach 7 Collaborative approach that necessitates philanthropist and philanthropic organisations to rally around a shared idea, which results in their not only pooling resources but also thinking about how to formulate integrated solutions to problems at scale. Elaborating on the collaborative approach highlighted above some funding mechanisms used by philanthropic organizations include green bonds, ESG funding, funding sustainability etc. 7 AVPN-Collaborative-Philanthropy-in-Asia 2021 . p d f https://cityofgood.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AVPN-Collaborative-Philanthropy-in-Asia.pdf 38 --- Page 40 --- Collective action and collaboration among the public, private and people sectors is another opportunity as well where platforms such as AVPN can promote collective action by connecting investors/donors to organizations working on sustainability such as The Council. EDGE Funders Alliance Demonstrating change through community donors and philanthropy: Edge Funders has a community of 320 donors, foundation ofﬁcers, trustees and advisors in more than 30 countries countries, passionately engaged in local, national and international grantmaking within 103 diverse institutions with differing priorities and strategies, but a shared belief that equity and justice are critical to furthering sustainable, global well-being. The community donors fund towards greater equity and sustainable practice today and they address systemic challenges and contribute to transformational change over the long term. EDGE works towards two main goals: ● BUILDING COMMUNITY: They facilitate the emergence of connections and trust between individuals and organisations who share the conviction that systemic answers are essential to address the interconnected crisis situation of our times – a home for systemic change philanthropy. ● CHANGING PHILANTHROPY: They build a consistent voice to challenge the philanthropy sector and shift practice towards accountable relationships supporting systemic change and transformative actors. Funding platform: They have various funding models and one of the signiﬁcant funding models is Participatory Funding model. FundAction was born at the EDGE Funders Alliance European Retreat in 2016, four foundations (Open Society Initiative for Europe, European Cultural Foundation, Charles Leopold Mayer Foundation and Guerrilla Foundation) decided to pool funding. Decision-making is a learning tool for FundAction members. By reviewing, discussing and applying for grants, the Assembly members learn from each other, expand their networks and improve their own skills. The Assembly takes daily decisions at FundAction platform Opportunities for CEEW : Across India there are numerous philanthropic initiatives, academia and local investors - Mature corporate foundations to responsible givers, there are cross cutting thematic areas. CEEW could identify potential areas of interest and develop a pooled fund for research and advisory for the sector. Knowledge platform: Edge Europe is a grand initiative and they grew up to 55 members. The current members of the group are: 39 --- Page 41 --- ● Claudia Neubauer, FPH ● Jenny Oppenheimer, Lankelly Chase ● Maartje Eigeman, Democracy &amp;amp; Media Foundation ● Martin Modlinger, Renewable Freedom Foundation ● Philippe Mayol, CCFD – Fondation Terre Solidaire ● Renata Cuk, OSIFE ● Romy Krämer, Guerrilla Foundation ● Shikha Sethia, Mama Cash EDGE publications : They conduct conferences annually on organising philanthropy and addressing Systemic change. These opportunities create knowledge assets in the sector and build relationships with the donors and investment decision makers. Opportunities ahead: The Council in addition to creating a collaborative community engagement space for funding, investments, policy to action, could establish a credible knowledge platform to regularly mine information for the cross cutting thematic areas of interest - climate change and sustainable development. Domestic investments and global funds such as Green climate funds are routed through NABARD, CSR investments and Philanthropy can be tied up together to pool up funds for creating knowledge and funding platforms. Corporates collaboratively committing to a cause Tapping into corporate sustainability collaborative channels, where the corporations and the associated value chain is collaborating for a speciﬁc sustainability driver / actor is a potential area where the sectoral needs and advancements overlap with the regulatory direction, compliance and market growth. The Council could leverage in collaborating key research partners / a guiding think tank in this space where potential donors are willing to commit for the transformative cause on not at the project level. Climate Pledge Fund The climate pledge is a cross-sector community of corporations, organizations, individuals, and partners, working together to crack the climate crisis and solve the challenges of decarbonizing their existing value chain and eventually the nation&amp;#x27;s economy. The climate pledge fund in speciﬁc is a corporate venture capital fund that invests in companies across multiple industry sectors with a common theme of sustainable and decarbonizing technologies and services. The Council could potentially leverage the investor network investing on integrated ideas and not be restricted by their funds to a speciﬁc sector/domain that delivers a larger change across the ecosystem. The role for an organization like The Council has in this space can be listed as follows 40 --- Page 42 --- ● Sectoral landscaping/benchmarking - Focus on studies for the sector as a whole, where knowledge products are developed that have potential implications on the entire sector. CEEW could elevate its branding and create product-lines through publications of landscape studies and provide insights on the sector as per the thematic areas. The knowledge gaps for investment and implementations could be addressed through such studies. For example, CEEW could publish the sectoral investment opportunities in Electric Mobility in the next 3- 5 years among MSMEs, development of Cluster based or SEZ based investment guidance and much more. ● Reporting tools &amp;amp; frameworks - Designing of reporting frameworks and tools is another key area where there is scope for The Council. As seen in the case with the climate pledge discussed earlier, measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis is a key commitment for all the stakeholders which are part of the initiative. CEEW could become the messenger of Sustainability and Climate Change reporting for India. Besides Business Responsibility Reporting, India hasn’t come up with reporting frameworks and tools. Many organisations are grappling with the difﬁculty to make strategic business decisions as they have limited knowledge on sustainability and climate change in terms of climate change, sustainability and risks as businesses face. ● Scaling and replication - Designing strategies and approaches for scaling and replication of the initiative is a possible area where The Council could play a pivotal role in guiding transition to transformation. Research Consortiums and Platform approach In this approach, we demonstrate the potential of The Council to form the intellectual core of the sustainability councils and key research consortiums. The core functions of the consortiums, membered by think tanks and research institutions committed to providing policy advice, key sectoral research, evidence generation across priority interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary sectoral and thematic areas, policy to action / evidence to action strategy, business modelling and creation of knowledge assets / public goods. 41 --- Page 43 --- A platform driven consortium approach has been pivotal and effective where the core team from the consortium creates an interactive space to ﬂoat new ideas, debate underlying issues, and publicize their policy work in progress. Key research outputs, policy briefs, white papers, technical seminars etc. could be key assets and content advocated and disseminated through the platform. What could the platform offer? Supporting innovation and incubation of ideas and research for sustainable development Empower the policy makers with evidence, science, technology and innovations and incubation of scalable, replicable ideas for research and development, creating sectoral assets to foster sustainable development by connecting various disciplines, methods and approaches. Building interdisciplinary, international and local networks to address sustainability issues The proposed consortium with support of the The Councils’ positioning in the sector, ecosystem and decision making value chain fosters convening of researchers, practitioners and decision makers, from policy makers and key inﬂuencers to sustainable consultants, advocates etc. to generate knowledge, assets and explore solutions to sustainable problems and pressing human needs Nurturing researchers, strengthening institutions and the research ecosystem The research consortium through fellowships, workshops, seminars and mentorship programs, housed by The Council could drive landscaping, scoping, identiﬁcation and supporting the key human capital - young professionals, SMEs, Domain experts, veterans across the sustainable development and policy development and dissemination value chain. While developing and supporting individual scholars and capable institutions, the platform could focus on the sustainability ecosystem for knowledge production at an institutional level through capacity building, resource sharing, and networking. 42 --- Page 44 --- Advocating and disseminating sectoral evidences, knowledge assets and public good Relying upon diverse forms ranging from peer reviewed papers to journals and other digital forums to conferences and public events, the consortium with directions from The Council could deepen the comprehension and perceptions of sustainable development by sustainability inﬂuencers, advocators, policymakers, investors, grant making organisations, CSOs, practitioners, and citizens. Through strengthening institutions and exploring digital frontiers, the platform hosted by The Council could work to expand scholarly access to knowledge, particularly in arenas where access has traditionally been limited. Case Study - Research Consortium Laying foundation to raise research investment through consortium To tackle wicked problems, biggest challenges and mega-targets from sustainability and climate change such as achieving Zero Net Emissions, achieving 450 GigaWatt and others by 2030 there is a need to formulate research consortiums. The need to raise extensive funding could be addressed by a consortium approach . UK-RI has committed to raise 22 Billion Pound Sterling per year by 2024-2025 and the research consortium model would comprise academics, businesses, charities and wider society in the UK. CEEW could raise active private investment-Investment funds,blending ﬁnancing products, and foster partnerships with strategic entities across academia, peer research agencies, business institutions, foundations and HNIs in India and abroad. The merit of this model could result in CEEW to work beyond FCRA funding and achieving unearmaked funds. It would reduce bureaucracy, creating models for actionable researches, actions to policy making and funding multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research. Preparing ambitious research goals through Innovation and Expert Councils IDRC and UKRI have established expert councils among discovery research, applied research, innovation, commercialisation and deployment. CEEW could set 2030 goals for research and development in the country to promote innovations, expand and deepen their expertise in the councils to secure and reap the economic and social beneﬁts from research. The expert councils could drive CEEW innovation in research methods and driving actionable and as per UKRI, they stimulate private sector investment. 43 --- Page 45 --- Research Consortium approach could strengthen the talent pool with the expansion and deepening of expert councils and driving innovation support systems. According to UKRI, this could help CEEW to increase the attractiveness and sustainability of careers throughout the R&amp;amp;D workforce – not just for researchers, but also for technicians, innovators, entrepreneurs and practitioners. Developing an investment to implement philosophy UKRI approaches the following model of developing, World class research methods, World class multidisciplinary facilities, World class innovations and World class skills. They want to become the most sought research agency in the country to drive infrastructure investments and research and developments in the sustainable development and climate change sector. CEEW would be the face of the consortium playing a greater role among think tanks, business needs and academia and could drive investments in speciﬁc partners and thematic areas and lead the climate change initiatives from research to action. The research and innovation system is complex and multidimensional and UKRI consider them as stewards of the system. As a research aggregation platform, UKRI uses the levers at their disposal in an integrated and coordinated way to support a diverse portfolio of outstanding research, innovation, and the people and infrastructure needed to deliver it; This model would drive up prosperity across CEEW, in driving the investments to implement solutions on ground, provide and support efﬁcient, effective public services. 44 --- Page 46 --- In summary, CEEW would apply research consortium as a platform to raise un-earmarked funds to address megaproblems of the country through stimulation of innovative research funding models, expanding and deepening research councils and creating roadmaps to address climate change action plans in the country. Global marketplace for funding, fundraising and grantmaking The consortium driven by The Council creates a marketplace for investors, donors, MDBs, Quasi DBs etc. to shape and disburse sustainability grants, funds for advocacy and dissemination, untied cause funding, and awards to researchers and institutions to ﬁnd solutions for global sustainability and sustainable development challenges.

Climate change fund - Promote something that takes out emissions, creating carbon sinks,conservation etc that is the focus of the fund. Focus only on for proﬁt enterprises. They take 10-15 years to return though, they are not programme driven, mission driven etc. Cash to cash cycle is important. Only difference is they are willing to wait longer rather than 5-7 years which is the norm in PE. Because the gestation period is long. Patient capital is something Aavishkar is willing to do. Focus on SMEs in both debt and equity. ESG compliance → No such focus, they leave the SMEs to self regulate as the buyers demand the same. Aavishkar portfolio is not more than 20 companies, spread across the world. This is not looked at like a programme. So at least with Aavishkar they do not have a speciﬁc portion of the fund for ESG compliance, research etc. Limited exposure to not for proﬁt space. Intellecap focuses on the same. No research focus from Aavishkar, as of now they have not commissioned any studies. Lack of clarity in terms of the energy space, EV an example of this. Not thought through in detail. Implications for CEEW: 1) PE players are focused on ﬁnancial returns, while some offer patient capital like Aavishkar majority do not. They are not mission or programme driven, Portfolio sizes are very small hence the focus is more on the individual companies rather than at the portfolio level. Research does not have much of a role to play in this space both in terms of decision making or compliances. For CEEWs requirements of independent funding at a nexus of domains these proﬁle of funders will not ﬁt even if CEEW decides to go down the for-proﬁt route as here the focus is on returns albeit with patient capital. Intellecap- 47 --- Page 49 --- Powering Livelihoods → Not sure what incentive they have to be in this, alignment on the enterprise side not very clear. Scale is not that high as well so maybe PL allows an ear to the ground in terms of innovation etc but there are maybe better ways such as an incubation or an accelerator might make more sense. Have not heard about them in the enterprise space, so not clear on what they offer, what is their value proposition for this space. USP? Implications for CEEW: Funding in the space predominantly on mitigation and less on adaptation - Approaches and documentation on adaptation is something CEEW can do. Innovations in these domains etc is something I would look at them for, They should pick and choose better, what they are known for and what should people come to them for is important to understand. Not sure what exactly they are known for in this space. In the next decade it should be clear on what they are known for. ESG ﬁnancing is a scope for them in terms of being a trusted advisor for major organizations , stakeholders in this space. Not sure where exactly they can ﬁt in but WB, ADB, GIZ etc have policy related funding which might be relevant in terms of CEEW providing an independent view. TERI, WRI, Big 4 I see as their competitors, research on the policy side. At the same time IIHS would also be their competitor. Maybe looking at how their research is used might help in understanding who their competitors are. Don&amp;#x27;t see them much from a sub-national point of view, however they can bridge this by bringing in a few key strategic partners. Nilekani Foundation: Climate change is adjacent to their existing work, not a whole lot of planned engagement here. Not much clarity on where it is leading upto. Broad landscape and it is evolving is how they see it. Trust is the core basis on how they engage with people.Quality of ideas, quality of team etc is what we focus on Role stays with civil society. Multiyear unrestricted funding is what they prefer. Early stage funders, some framework we do have but nothing too rigid. Openness is key for them 48 --- Page 50 --- Implications for CEEW 1. Great synergies with what organizations like CEEW do - Working in the nexus of domins, focus on multi year funding with being open to early stage funding. They prefer unrestricted funding as well. They fund people they trust, they believe in, which ﬁts in very well with what CEEW is looking for, where the investments are on the people rather than projects. If CEEWs leadership can build that trust with them, they will deﬁnitely be among the go to funders for CEEW. HNIs like this work well in the context of what CEEW is looking for. Omidyar Foundation Change can happen through non-proﬁt organizations. Grants to non-proﬁt organizations is something they do. Impact and returns on the same continuum. Strategy areas for 5 years. Currently funding 6 to 7 sectors Educ , property rights, FI, Emerging technologies, digital societie, Gov and citizen engagement. Open digital eco-system - Non proﬁt sector development are experimental. Measure impact - Direct and sectoral Energy and environment does not ﬁt in current strategy cycles, as a lot of funding is already there. EV under emerging technologies is a space they are in. Structured way of working, focus on issues that they feel are important. 49 --- Page 51 --- 50 --- Page 52 --- 51 --- Page 53 --- 52 --- Page 54 --- 53 --- Page 55 --- 54 --- Page 56 --- CEEW, according to him, will be an impact star, high degree of impact is how they would see CEEW at this point. YSB: Not for proﬁts are there as well, no early stage. Focus on when things are more stable. Patient debt Quasi equity Some revenue based model has to be there 55 --- Page 57 --- Cannot be simply donor driven Example of training where students pay to a trust etc - NSDC, CSRs and students paying . Charity they dont Energy is a focus, Agri-Energy nexus is a focus → Sustainable business models in this space is a oppn. EVs See a huge gap here Carbon credits is something that they can look at Besides this no new business models have come in at this point of time No research funding so far, however they are inﬂuencing people who can . They dont see a lot of business cases for a research think tank. Predictive modeling etc in climate change they see scope CEEW Clearly you need a business model here to tap into this funding, which means you have a customer, you have revenue sources and at least operational costs you should cover. YSB can cover your capital costs etc but having a sustainable business model is non-negotiable. So this would require CEEW to signiﬁcantly pivot, and over the course of time they should cover their costs. Focus areas there are synergies such as Climate-Agri nexus, EVs etc. Other parameters align as well but there should be a signiﬁcant pivot from CEEW. Social Alpha Focus on early stage startups, customized to each sector they operate in. 56 --- Page 58 --- Key recommendations ● Claiming everything under the sun, attribution not being clear. Best contribution. Have supporting documents for the same. Contribution vs attribution. How does this work in the policy space? ○ Why even claim it? Maybe talk about how funders view this? ○ If CEEW knows donors don&amp;#x27;t look for it maybe they ○ Is it tied to their positioning? Focus on being a pioneer/evangelist? ○ Competencies on public communication for CEEW seems higher ○ Do a word check (google analytics) on the perception of how CEEW is in terms of quality (Energy, environment, climate and other spaces) . ○ Your hypothesis is within the sector they are more market tuned, points for reﬂection ○ Nexus of sectors is not that great looking at what we have heard so far ○ Maybe they are not proactive, is it because of vintage - Hence how they should look at next 10-15 years? ○ Is this a viable long term strategy if they go behind all the current issues? ○ Why NPA think thanks are needed? Markets cannot solve all problems, these act as checks and balances in the sector. (Can we start with this). Role of a civil society player. This serves as the context. Let us talk at this level. This is followed by the ■ What think thanks are supposed to be? Use all criteria that is possible ■ Analyse CEEW in this framework ■ Recommendations to bridge gap - Depth vs width ---&amp;gt;different paths, strategic choice CEEW should make, criteria we will give ○ Perception map for all the competitors - Get activities for each and see what axes , say this internal/external ﬁt is there ■ One axis is sector ---&amp;gt; TERI CSTEPS are wider ● Cohort 2 ○ Exploitation path for cohort 1 should be depth 57 --- Page 59 --- ○ Exploration should be wider - Gaps in the organization structure and capability itself, this will tell the road map to 2030. ● Where are you today? - Legacy and cohort 1 ● Where you want to be? - External opportunities as per cohort 2 ○ Ind Philan - Pitch at intent level, trust based ○ Private equity - incubatee model or a for proﬁt entity → Research as an input to this → Market based solutions → outputs of this into a for proﬁt models which can be funded by Aavishkar (Renewable vs mineral security etc COAL as a example of this) ○ Research on intersection → outputs/solutions → funded by PE (Connect to the role of civil society) - Guiding the social entrepreneurs in the sector to the right direction ○ Renewpower as an example that something CEEW can set up ○ ● Gaps and roadmap ● Logically come up with a ﬂow 58</Content>

End of presentation - Slide No. 23 --- Page 3 --- Prelude to the presentation --- Page 4 --- Ethos of the perception study Principles and Approaches that govern this donor perception mapping study is enlisted. It is therefore critical to keep in mind that, • Data is highly qualitative and captures critical perceptions and sentiments • Governed by trust and anonymity - synthesis must reﬂect on donor’s truest contexts and perceptions without bias • Nature of interaction has been free ﬂowing, evolving with the expression of the donors (not all topics are covered for all donors) • Opinions and the intensity of perceptions cannot be quantiﬁed using a linear approach - A composite model of weightage has been utilised • Wherever appropriate and possible, donors have been quoted, highlighted and examples provided • Wherever appropriate and possible, we have adopted the principles of perception mapping by incorporating experiences and contexts provided by the donors --- Page 5 --- How has CMS approached synthesis of perceptions • The sentiments and perceptions of donors have been processed without losing the essence of the donors expression • Eliminating any objective or conﬁrmation or information biases • CMS has collected and synthesised the perceptions controlling for the trust and anonymity • Hence, we have put in an effort to morph and represent the perceptions without disclosing the identity of the respondent or the donor • Ascertain weightage • Not just based on a number or percentage of donors saying X or Y • But by factoring; • Maturity of the relationship between the donor and The Council • Longevity of the partnership/relationship • Frequency and the intensity of the engagement - number of grants, the value of grants, nature of engagement • Sectoral positioning • Alignment to The Council’s vision 2030 --- Page 6 --- Study &amp;amp; the Approach --- Page 7 --- Objectives of the study The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) aims to commission a perception survey among the donor community — a key stakeholder for The Council — to understand its growth, impact, risks and vision for the future from their perspective. • Understanding Impact : Mapping CEEW&amp;#x27;s research, advisory and outreach — and the impact CEEW has had (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials. • Understanding Growth : Analysing perceptions around CEEW’s growth being organic, planned or strategic; areas where we have surpassed expectations and where potential remains not fully realised. • Understanding Visibility : Analysing CEEW’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset. • Understanding Risks : Analysing how donors perceive CEEW’s governance as well as the risks that CEEW must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, external environment or strategic directions. • Understanding Demand : Assessing what donors want and ﬁnding points of synergy between the two approaches without compromising on CEEW’s well-earned independence • Understanding our value-proposition : Assessing perceptions on CEEW’s values and priorities, including being integrated in analysis, international/global in outlook, independent of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy. • Benchmarking CEEW against domestic and international competition 410+ seminars and conferences 330+ research projects 260+ peer-reviewed publications 130+ new datasets created or improved access to data 860+ government engagements worldwide As on 2021 Source: CEEW Report (2020-21 Review) --- Page 8 --- Discussions with the Leadership Group @ The Council Below are the discussions conducted with key internal stakeholders 1.

CAG Cohort 1 Sampling Universe N = 54 Cohort 1 Final Study Sampling N = 12 --- Page 12 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 1. Human capital and research capabilities came out as being perceived as superior quality (both thematic and functional expertise) • Charismatic and entrepreneurial leadership perception was the hallmark across the spectrum of donors • T eams and researchers are empowered with decentralised decision-making power , which assists the programmes and initiatives • Ability to conceive complex research hypotheses , strong analytical competencies, strengthening the research ecosystem Quote - The Council can be ranked as one of the top think tanks in the sector regarding its social capital, networking capabilities, and technical knowledge. Their researchers are part of the GOI steering and planning and policy committees, providing key inputs in policy making and implementation. • Expect to see a capacitated second line of business, and entrepreneurial leaders (50% of the donors) • Institutionalised approach to broad base engagement • Across the levels of the organisation, not restricted to the senior leadership only 2. Recognition as a refreshing think tank - A ﬁtting institution and an ecosystem fostering sector-shaping, futuristic research • Young, aggressive, pathﬁnder institution (40% of the donors) • Platform with scope for growth opportunities to well-qualiﬁed personnel • Revered for reputation, integrity, and ﬁnancial transparency • Potential for both the approaches • Becoming a global think tank leveraging the social and human capital • Strengthening the local &amp;amp; sub-national partnerships, initiatives, and funding to becoming a pioneer within India (40% of the donors) Quote - Having a young and energetic team is The Council’s strength. Their teams have the capacity to ideate and innovate with the sectoral experts who are members of the Government committees and state-level authorities. They quite often pursue futuristic research. --- Page 13 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, convenings and collaboration with national governments •Networking, convenings and collaborations with policymakers in the Central Government are superior strengths (100% of the donors) •Spearheaded changes and policies at the national level (ex. National Hydrogen Mission, Cooling NCAP etc.) •Quality of networking and collaborations needs to be developed at the sub-national level to leverage opportunities and emerge as a pioneering local think tank (40% of the donors) Quote - As a leading voice in India’s climate and sustainability sector, The Council occupies a unique position and an opportunity to make a signiﬁcant difference. There are real and burning concerns around issues such as transition, and social responsibility, where The Council have the independence and the power to voice their opinion and ignite exciting deliberations. 3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, convenings and collaboration with national governments •Perceived proximity of the leadership to the government stakeholders - raising questions on “independence” (25% of the donors) •Improving the cohesion of collaborating with the peer institutions and competitive think tanks (4 donors) •Opportunity to attract collaborative driven funding and leverage funding for complex •Intersectional issues where the risks of failure or inaction are distributed across the collaborating partners --- Page 14 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products •High quality outputs, data visualisations and presentation for research ﬁndings (80% of the donors) •Quality and quantity of research outputs in the format of papers, articles, and citations across markets and sectors were appreciated and numerous examples were cited •Seminars, conferences and the convening capacity perceived as outstanding •Relevance and engagement of stakeholders in each convening improved the quality of convenings Quote - The Council does possess good inroads with the sector&amp;#x27;s policy circle (government), and their research, report and data are credible and are widely accepted by the government and other stakeholders 4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products •A general sentiment has been that The Council claims attribution beyond the proportionate share when it comes to policy announcements by the Government, which dilutes the “independence” as a value (3 donors) Quote - The Council tries to project their contribution as attribution in many instances. One recent example would be during the COP-26 summit, when Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Net Zero Commitment and an action plan for the target year, 2070; The Council is one of the many claimants to claim how various pieces of their work in the sector, their contributions in the steering committees etc. have been directly responsible for India&amp;#x27;s stance. It came from their CEO’s handle. This approach is something The Council must reﬂect upon. Not every statement by the government and recent trend needs to be cross validated from their platforms and claimed credit. --- Page 15 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 5. Engagement strategy (referring to engagement with donors under initiatives or programmes) is effective and has a lot of scope to strengthen further •Willingness to engage on a strategic/long-term partnership (100% donors) •Engagement and communication (programme or initiative level) have been well received •Autoﬁt/First choice for donors who have a criterion for selection of grantees/partners. The Council perceived as one of the top think tanks to engage in the sector (capability, capacity and capital wise) Quote - The Council considers the donor&amp;#x27;s expectations and co-creates the design and strategy for the study. However, we have not encountered an instance where there is a compromise on the ﬁndings. The objectivity in research is of higher order to the expectations of the funding institution. 5. Engagement strategy is effective and has a lot of scope to strengthen further •A “felt need” for an effective communication strategy (4 donors) •Concurrent communication beyond the realms of the engaging programme (newsletters, SM engagement etc.) , •Engaging the communication team from the beginning is becoming necessary (effectiveness of events, coordination during key disseminations etc.) •Generally, is perceived to occupy an elitist positioning with communication and outreach - More engagement with the policy and members of the higher hierarchy and lesser focus on the vulnerable and affected groups Quote - Due to a lack of involvement in the project from the start, the communications team were not intimately familiar with the content. As a result, it became difﬁcult because their content felt disconnected and caused misalignment during the event. --- Page 16 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 •Ecosystem role playing - provision of thought leadership support to the funding institutions in terms of shaping up donor strategy to achieving the mission •Models for impact at scale as in the powering livelihoods initiative •Evidence lever enabling donors strengthen ﬂagship programmes, and assisting in ideating towards emerging sectoral trends and gaps in the sector •Senior leadership able to uphold the quality of relationships as well as the outcomes (4 donors) •Awards and rankings were not signiﬁcant elements that inﬂuenced engagement (40% of the donors) •Potential to syndicate research, create research products that can be taken to scale across the sector and funders •Good model and process of engagement in grant management; •Dr. Arunabha performs most heavy lifting across partnerships, relationships, brand perception (50% of the donors) •Widen the current engagement levers beyond evidence generation, policy formulation, advocacy, dissemination, and outreach. •Working actively with implementation organisations, CSOs/NGOs etc . to create implementation designs, demonstrations, model, and scale building •Researchers are fatigued in programmes cause of many other involvements (2 donors) •Strengthen the talent acquisition process to hire diverse competencies- Attract and retain talented human capital (3 donors) •Incorporating a dedicated grant management team &amp;amp; Declutter the administrative process in repeated engagements and known donors --- Page 17 --- Cohort 1 - Way Forward • Nature of the think tank and the potential for growth • Great potential to expanding the great work globally • Deepening the nationals &amp;amp; subnational work to being a sectoral pioneer locally • Dr Arunabha holds the key for entrepreneurial leadership capital - the face of many relationships - diversifying the leadership capabilities • Pursue institutional development, capacity development, pursue sectoral needs that are unfunded, invest in complex and intersectional research designs • Potential to syndicating research, creation of core research and knowledge products, • Incubate sustainable business models that can be taken to scale across the sector and donor networks • Ecosystem role playing - Thought leadership support to the funding institutions in terms of shaping up strategy to achieving the mission, ideating towards emerging sectoral trends and gaps; maximise and accelerate impact • Improve the cohesion of working with the peer institutions and competitive think tanks to attract collaborative driven funding and leverage funding for complex and intersectional issues --- Page 18 --- Human Capital Engagement Knowledge and Assets Reputation and integrity Network and collaborations (Social Capital) Market / Sector Perspective T echnology &amp;amp; Innovation Financial transparency and fundraising strategy 1.

End of presentation - Slide No. 23 --- Page 3 --- Prelude to the presentation --- Page 4 --- Ethos of the perception study Principles and Approaches that govern this donor perception mapping study is enlisted. It is therefore critical to keep in mind that, • Data is highly qualitative and captures critical perceptions and sentiments • Governed by trust and anonymity - synthesis must reﬂect on donor’s truest contexts and perceptions without bias • Nature of interaction has been free ﬂowing, evolving with the expression of the donors (not all topics are covered for all donors) • Opinions and the intensity of perceptions cannot be quantiﬁed using a linear approach - A composite model of weightage has been utilised • Wherever appropriate and possible, donors have been quoted, highlighted and examples provided • Wherever appropriate and possible, we have adopted the principles of perception mapping by incorporating experiences and contexts provided by the donors --- Page 5 --- How has CMS approached synthesis of perceptions • The sentiments and perceptions of donors have been processed without losing the essence of the donors expression • Eliminating any objective or conﬁrmation or information biases • CMS has collected and synthesised the perceptions controlling for the trust and anonymity • Hence, we have put in an effort to morph and represent the perceptions without disclosing the identity of the respondent or the donor • Ascertain weightage • Not just based on a number or percentage of donors saying X or Y • But by factoring; • Maturity of the relationship between the donor and The Council • Longevity of the partnership/relationship • Frequency and the intensity of the engagement - number of grants, the value of grants, nature of engagement • Sectoral positioning • Alignment to The Council’s vision 2030 --- Page 6 --- Study &amp;amp; the Approach --- Page 7 --- Objectives of the study The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) aims to commission a perception survey among the donor community — a key stakeholder for The Council — to understand its growth, impact, risks and vision for the future from their perspective. • Understanding Impact : Mapping CEEW&amp;#x27;s research, advisory and outreach — and the impact CEEW has had (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials. • Understanding Growth : Analysing perceptions around CEEW’s growth being organic, planned or strategic; areas where we have surpassed expectations and where potential remains not fully realised. • Understanding Visibility : Analysing CEEW’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset. • Understanding Risks : Analysing how donors perceive CEEW’s governance as well as the risks that CEEW must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, external environment or strategic directions. • Understanding Demand : Assessing what donors want and ﬁnding points of synergy between the two approaches without compromising on CEEW’s well-earned independence • Understanding our value-proposition : Assessing perceptions on CEEW’s values and priorities, including being integrated in analysis, international/global in outlook, independent of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy. • Benchmarking CEEW against domestic and international competition 410+ seminars and conferences 330+ research projects 260+ peer-reviewed publications 130+ new datasets created or improved access to data 860+ government engagements worldwide As on 2021 Source: CEEW Report (2020-21 Review) --- Page 8 --- Discussions with the Leadership Group @ The Council Below are the discussions conducted with key internal stakeholders 1.

Human capital and research capabilities came out as being perceived as superior quality (both thematic and functional expertise) • Charismatic and entrepreneurial leadership perception was the hallmark across the spectrum of donors • T eams and researchers are empowered with decentralised decision-making power , which assists the programmes and initiatives • Ability to conceive complex research hypotheses , strong analytical competencies, strengthening the research ecosystem Quote - The Council can be ranked as one of the top think tanks in the sector regarding its social capital, networking capabilities, and technical knowledge. Their researchers are part of the GOI steering and planning and policy committees, providing key inputs in policy making and implementation. • Expect to see a capacitated second line of business, and entrepreneurial leaders (50% of the donors) • Institutionalised approach to broad base engagement • Across the levels of the organisation, not restricted to the senior leadership only 2. Recognition as a refreshing think tank - A ﬁtting institution and an ecosystem fostering sector-shaping, futuristic research • Young, aggressive, pathﬁnder institution (40% of the donors) • Platform with scope for growth opportunities to well-qualiﬁed personnel • Revered for reputation, integrity, and ﬁnancial transparency • Potential for both the approaches • Becoming a global think tank leveraging the social and human capital • Strengthening the local &amp;amp; sub-national partnerships, initiatives, and funding to becoming a pioneer within India (40% of the donors) Quote - Having a young and energetic team is The Council’s strength. Their teams have the capacity to ideate and innovate with the sectoral experts who are members of the Government committees and state-level authorities. They quite often pursue futuristic research. --- Page 13 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, convenings and collaboration with national governments •Networking, convenings and collaborations with policymakers in the Central Government are superior strengths (100% of the donors) •Spearheaded changes and policies at the national level (ex. National Hydrogen Mission, Cooling NCAP etc.) •Quality of networking and collaborations needs to be developed at the sub-national level to leverage opportunities and emerge as a pioneering local think tank (40% of the donors) Quote - As a leading voice in India’s climate and sustainability sector, The Council occupies a unique position and an opportunity to make a signiﬁcant difference. There are real and burning concerns around issues such as transition, and social responsibility, where The Council have the independence and the power to voice their opinion and ignite exciting deliberations. 3. Sector-leading social capital - Quality networking, convenings and collaboration with national governments •Perceived proximity of the leadership to the government stakeholders - raising questions on “independence” (25% of the donors) •Improving the cohesion of collaborating with the peer institutions and competitive think tanks (4 donors) •Opportunity to attract collaborative driven funding and leverage funding for complex •Intersectional issues where the risks of failure or inaction are distributed across the collaborating partners --- Page 14 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products •High quality outputs, data visualisations and presentation for research ﬁndings (80% of the donors) •Quality and quantity of research outputs in the format of papers, articles, and citations across markets and sectors were appreciated and numerous examples were cited •Seminars, conferences and the convening capacity perceived as outstanding •Relevance and engagement of stakeholders in each convening improved the quality of convenings Quote - The Council does possess good inroads with the sector&amp;#x27;s policy circle (government), and their research, report and data are credible and are widely accepted by the government and other stakeholders 4. Sector shaping research outputs and knowledge products •A general sentiment has been that The Council claims attribution beyond the proportionate share when it comes to policy announcements by the Government, which dilutes the “independence” as a value (3 donors) Quote - The Council tries to project their contribution as attribution in many instances. One recent example would be during the COP-26 summit, when Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Net Zero Commitment and an action plan for the target year, 2070; The Council is one of the many claimants to claim how various pieces of their work in the sector, their contributions in the steering committees etc. have been directly responsible for India&amp;#x27;s stance. It came from their CEO’s handle. This approach is something The Council must reﬂect upon. Not every statement by the government and recent trend needs to be cross validated from their platforms and claimed credit. --- Page 15 --- Key synthesis from Cohort 1 5. Engagement strategy (referring to engagement with donors under initiatives or programmes) is effective and has a lot of scope to strengthen further •Willingness to engage on a strategic/long-term partnership (100% donors) •Engagement and communication (programme or initiative level) have been well received •Autoﬁt/First choice for donors who have a criterion for selection of grantees/partners. The Council perceived as one of the top think tanks to engage in the sector (capability, capacity and capital wise) Quote - The Council considers the donor&amp;#x27;s expectations and co-creates the design and strategy for the study. However, we have not encountered an instance where there is a compromise on the ﬁndings. The objectivity in research is of higher order to the expectations of the funding institution. 5. Engagement strategy is effective and has a lot of scope to strengthen further •A “felt need” for an effective communication strategy (4 donors) •Concurrent communication beyond the realms of the engaging programme (newsletters, SM engagement etc.) , •Engaging the communication team from the beginning is becoming necessary (effectiveness of events, coordination during key disseminations etc.) •Generally, is perceived to occupy an elitist positioning with communication and outreach - More engagement with the policy and members of the higher hierarchy and lesser focus on the vulnerable and affected groups Quote - Due to a lack of involvement in the project from the start, the communications team were not intimately familiar with the content.

Poor diet quality contributes towards persistent nutrient deﬁciency, and food safety net programs in this region, although present at scale, often favour grain heavy diets over nutrient diversity. India particularly falls into the category of serious hunger, as evidenced by data hosted by the Global Hunger Index, with 14% of the general population being malnourished and 36% of children under ﬁve being stunted. Although malnutrition has reduced since 2000, these improvements have not commensurately translated into reduced child malnutrition and stunting. In Bangladesh, 12% of the general population is malnourished, and 24% of children under ﬁve are stunted. While Nepal occupies a relatively lower level of malnourishment compared to India and Bangladesh (with 6% of the population experiencing malnourishment), child stunting (25% of children under ﬁve years of age) 1 remains a notable concern for public health. Malnourishment, especially in children, can lead to considerable health complications, imparting a greater risk of illness and reduced capacity for learning and study. Repeated incidences of illnesses would increase expenditure on healthcare, and reduce the number of workdays available for households. Further, child malnourishment compromises their ability to transform their lives through education, further perpetuating the cycle of poverty and suffering. Given that food security programs targeting availability of staple grains are insufﬁcient in ensuring that the poor have access to a sufﬁciently diverse and wholesome diet, a holistic approach towards 1 Figures and statistics sourced from the Global Hunger Index ( https://www.globalhungerindex.org/ ) --- Page 4 --- tackling hunger is required. In this context, [Client Organization]’s ([CLIENT ORGANIZATION]) [Client Program] ([CLIENT PROGRAM]) initiative is a notable program that adopts a multifaceted approach towards educating and empowering malnourished rural communities in India, Nepal and Bangladesh to secure sufﬁcient nutrient availability. The [CLIENT PROGRAM] program works at both the household and at the community level. For households, [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] conducts 15-day nutrition camps that educate mothers of malnourished children on nutrition education, child feeding, and child care practices among other topics. Households are further educated on optimal and sustainable cultivation and usage strategies of homestead land to maximise nutrient production by area, and are connected to government entitlements and services for sanitation and health to better improve their resilience. At the community level, initiatives include disseminating education on linking agriculture and local natural resources management (LANN) and building experiencing-sharing communities within geographies. From September 2018, this program has been in operation in 260 selected villages across India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Such a program has the potential to impart sustainable nutritional resilience among poorer communities in South Asia. However, given the multidimensional approach towards eradicating malnutrition, which can prove complex in certain circumstances, as well as the unique cultures and geographies of this region, it is imperative to rigorously evaluate the program to ensure that it continues to align with the outcomes highlighted in the theory of change. This evaluation will ﬁrst assess existing [CLIENT PROGRAM] program data to determine if it adequately measures success, outcomes, sustainability, and stakeholder needs. Based on this, the second phase will reﬁne or redesign the evaluation framework to deliver robust, actionable insights on program performance and effectiveness. Technical Approach and Methodology Data Quality Assessment As a ﬁrst step towards evaluating the [CLIENT PROGRAM] program, the team at CMS will delve rigorously into the quality and extent of existing data available and provided by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]. We will adopt the data quality evaluation framework used by USAID, developed in accordance with the Automated Directives System (ADS) 203. This framework provides ﬁve overarching dimensions along which data quality will be evaluated: Validity, Integrity, Precision, Reliability, and Timeliness (V-I-P-R-T). A schematic outlining an indicative assessment of the [CLIENT PROGRAM]’s program data through the lens of this framework is highlighted below. --- Page 5 --- The data quality assessment will utilize [CLIENT PROGRAM] program primary data, project reports, handbooks, documentation, country-speciﬁc government initiatives, and reliable national and international statistics to validate ﬁndings. This exercise aims to address the following: 1. How well does the Phase 1 and Phase 2 data align with assessing the program’s success in achieving improved dietary intake and better child and maternal health outcomes? 2. Does the data provide sufﬁcient information to evaluate the effectiveness of these outcomes compared to initial conditions? 3. Can the project’s future impact trajectory be assessed alongside a structured endline evaluation, or is additional data required? 4. Is the data granular enough to allow disaggregation by socio-economic, geographic, cultural, and demographic factors? 5. To what extent does the Phase 1 and Phase 2 data align with the requirements of stakeholders using the evaluation? 6. Are there gaps in the existing indicators for assessing program success, effectiveness, and sustainability? If so, what are they? 7. Is the data sufﬁcient for use in a rigorous endline evaluation to assess the program’s long-term success? CMS and its country data collection partners will undertake an immersion visit to the study area. The ﬁndings from this phase of the evaluation will help inform the approach that will be adopted in the endline evaluation of the [CLIENT PROGRAM] program. --- Page 6 --- Evaluation Framework The endline evaluation will use the REEISC-I framework, based on the OECD-DAC revised criteria (2019). This framework evaluates the intervention across six dimensions: Relevance, Effectiveness &amp;amp; Efﬁciency, Inclusivity, Impact, Sustainability, and Coherence. An indicative outline showing the alignment of these dimensions in the current assessment is depicted in the ﬁgure on the left. The evaluation will incorporate both assessments of households in terms of their dietary and nutrition proﬁles, health status (physical and mental), sanitation and hygiene facilities and practices, adoption of sustainable farming on homestead plots, and linkages to government schemes and entitlements both through and outside the program; as well as community cadre and organizations established under the aegis of the [CLIENT PROGRAM] to understand the extent of LANN+ dissemination through the community and other practices adopted. Evaluation Methodology/approach The approach taken to data analysis will be dependent on the ﬁndings and recommendations of the data quality assessment, to be conducted in the ﬁrst part of this evaluation. Three possible approaches are proposed below. Approach 1 : Pre/Post Analysis With the assumption that phase 1 and 2 data is suitable to provide a rigorous evaluation of the [CLIENT PROGRAM] program at the [Client Program] ([CLIENT PROGRAM]) level vis-a-vis its envisioned outcomes, a pre-post strategy will be employed, where statistics of households that were collected as part of the baseline evaluation before the induction of phase 1 will be compared to indicators sampled at endline. By focusing primarily on dimensions that were tackled by the program and not by local governments or civil society, this would provide an indicative insight into the change effected by the [CLIENT PROGRAM] program among participant households. Case control methodologies would also be considered wherein the differences in implementation rollout, timing, and strategies, if any, could be exploited to compare impacts in order to ascertain the effects of implementation intensity or exposure on outcomes. These could include the --- Page 7 --- availability of sustainable farming practices education or community level institutional establishment. Approach 2: Use of Propensity Score Matching In addition to a pre-post and case control analysis of beneﬁciaries, information could also be collected from demographically matched control households in villages located in proximity to [CLIENT PROGRAM]s, and allow for matching and comparison to estimate the improvements that the [CLIENT PROGRAM] approach effected among beneﬁciaries. This would require collection of data on both the treatment sample, and a separate matched control group (sized at 25% of the treatment sample). This approach would also be necessary in case the existing data on phase 1 and 2 is not completely adequate for assessing all intervention outcomes, thereby eschewing the pre-post analysis. Approach 3 : Building a New RCT If data from Phase 1 and 2 is deemed to be unsuitable, a new RCT could be conducted to evaluate Phase 3 of the program. This would use the available data to suggest improvements possible for Phase 3. The existing status of the population would be used as the baseline, and the evaluation would ascertain the additional beneﬁts brought to households, women and children as part of the improvements made to Phase 3. Under this approach, the control and treatment will follow random assignment. This approach would require both a baseline and an endline evaluation, with both treatment and control groups. The quantitative data requirements for each of the three proposed approaches are summarized in the chart below. Analytical Approach Data Requirements [CLIENT PROGRA M] Phase 1 &amp;amp; 2 Data Current Evaluation Future Evaluation Treatment Control Treatment Control Pre-Post ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ ❌ Propensity Score Matching ☑ ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ Randomised Control Trial ❌ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ - Data will be used/needs to be collected ☑ - Data will be partially used ❌ - Data not usable/not needed --- Page 8 --- Tool Design The survey will be conducted by trained ﬁeld enumerators utilising Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) tools. Questionnaires will capture information on the geographic particulars of the beneﬁciary residence, their demographic characteristics (age, marital status etc.), socioeconomic information (annual income, type of work, number of children, household income, working members in the household), information on household dietary diversity, access to government pensions and entitlements, and WASH practices. A tentative list of indicators and the stakeholder-wise probable sources of information for them are described in table A1 of the appendix. If required, for 20% of the households, detailed anthropometric information can be collected on all children aged under 5 years - including height, weight, girth, and other appropriate indicators. However, this has not been currently included in the budget. The proposed sample sizes for the evaluation, detailed in T able A2 of the appendix, are based on the chosen approach. Cochran’s (1963) formula for proportions, adjusted for ﬁnite populations, is used to determine sample sizes, accounting for a 10% attrition rate. For Approach 1, a sample size of 1,269 is required to estimate country-level statistics for the treatment group with a 95% conﬁdence interval and a margin of error of ±5%. Approach 2 (PSM) requires an additional control group of 317, bringing the total to 1,586. Approach 3 (RCT) involves 1,586 samples across two points (baseline and endline), totaling 3,172 surveys. The sampling design will use a two-stage approach, with villages as the ﬁrst stage units and participant households as the second. Villages will be selected based on program data, ensuring geographical diversity, program success, operations, and socioeconomic and demographic factors. From each village, 10-15 households will be surveyed, capturing the population&amp;#x27;s multidimensional diversity. Final numbers will be determined after reviewing program data and consulting with [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]. The quantitative survey will assess household level metrics to evaluate program success at the micro level. However, community level inﬂuences and evidence linking pathways to success to program outcomes will be elucidated through qualitative methodologies. Qualitative Methodology &amp;amp; Sample The qualitative survey will include focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and key informant interviews. Three focus group discussions will be held in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, involving key stakeholders such as participating households, community cadre (e.g., village self-help group leaders), local governing body ofﬁcials, government department representatives, and implementing agency representatives. --- Page 9 --- Thirty (30) households will also be selected among the best and worst performers in terms of nutrition and WASH practices for in depth interviews, which will be used to highlight case studies of the program. To better introduce quantitative rigour and qualitative analysis, Qualitative Comparative Analysis will be incorporated to delve into the in depth interviews/case studies. This method will attempt to link both the existing theories of change as well as alternative pathways derived from ﬁeld observations to case outcomes so that the combinations of program activities and behavioral changes that lead to attainment and sustenance (or lack thereof) of nutritional outcomes can be clearly elicited . The following analytical techniques will be used in conjunction with Qualitative Comparative Analysis. ● Narrative Analysis : As the IDI with beneﬁciaries aims to capture their personal experience and how they have managed to sustain the impact, narrative analysis will focus on how people expressed their feelings and what language they used while describing their experiences. ● Thematic Analysis : The IDI conducted with other stakeholders will provide better understanding and insights into programme design, its progress, operational challenges, external barriers and subsequent course corrections. A thematic analysis will help identify the key themes for systemic understanding which may not be known earlier. Key informant interviews will also be conducted among community cadre, governing body ofﬁcials, and representatives of the implementing agencies to obtain a more detailed understanding of the rollout of the program and ground level realities of its operation. A list of themes to be explored under qualitative study is included in table A1 of the appendix. The details of the proposed qualitative sample for approaches 1 and 2 are described in table A3 . If approach 3 is to be taken, then these ﬁgures will be doubled as the qualitative assessments will be repeated at both baseline and endline. Data Quality Assurance Data Quality Assurance Processes in CMS CMS ensures high-quality data through rigorous processes spanning design, collection, and cleaning stages: ● Tool Design &amp;amp; Translation : Digital tools are thoroughly tested during design and piloting stages. Translations into local languages are reviewed by senior field teams to ensure coherence and colloquial accuracy. ● Enumerator Selection : CMS selects expert enumerators based on strict criteria, prioritising local teams with domain experience, research ethics training, and skills in handling sensitive information. A gender-balanced team (50-50) is ensured for studies involving female participants. --- Page 10 --- ● Training : Field staff undergo rigorous training covering survey techniques, ethical standards, and troubleshooting. Sessions include role-playing, mock interviews, and workshops on digital tools, aligning the team with study goals to minimise interviewer bias and inconsistencies. ● Field Diaries : Enumerators maintain detailed daily diaries, documenting observations, challenges, and participant interactions. These diaries provide context for the data and help supervisors ensure consistency. ● Backchecks : Systematic backchecks validate data accuracy by re-interviewing a sample of participants. Supervisors compare responses to identify discrepancies. ● Concurrent Monitoring : Real-time data quality is ensured through on-site spot checks by field monitors, enabling immediate corrections to protocol deviations. ● Outlier Detection : Data is regularly analysed to flag outliers and anomalies. These are reviewed with the field team for resolution, ensuring consistency and reliability./ Appendix Table A1: Preliminary List of Indicators Under Quantitative and Qualitative Study Indicators Quantitative Qualitative Male Female Male Female Community Cadre Govt Ofﬁcials Demography Age, family composition, location ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Income, savings ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ Nutrition diversity Inclusion of different food groups ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ Sufﬁciency of food/food security ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ ❌ Adherence to [CLIENT PROGRAM] prescriptions/ diet ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Homestead garden produce ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Social protection Access and usage of relevant government schemes and pensions ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ PDS/PDFS access and usage ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ WASH Adoption of key hygienic practices ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ --- Page 11 --- (e.g. handwashing) Access to improved sources of water ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Adoption of sanitation practices (e.g. types of facilities used, open defecation rates etc) ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ ❌ Community Support Dissemination and adoption of LANN+ practices and guidelines ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌ ✅ ❌ Cluster level knowledge sharing and interactions ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌ ✅ ❌ Table A2: Approach-wise proposed quantitative sample sizes Table A3: Proposed Qualitative Sample India Nepal Bangladesh Total Focus Group Discussions 3 2 2 7 India Nepal Bangladesh Total Total Direct Participants 555701 31645 25298 61264 4 1269 Approach #1: Pre-Post Evaluation 427 422 420 1269 Approach #2: Propensity Score Matching Treatment 427 422 420 1269 1586 Control 107 105 105 317 Approach #3: Randomise d Controlled Trial Baseline Treatment 427 422 420 1269 1586 Control 107 105 105 317 Endline Treatment 427 422 420 1269 1586 Control 107 105 105 317 --- Page 12 --- Key Informant Interviews 6 6 6 18 In Depth Interviews 20 5 5 30 Total 29 13 13 55</Content>

They have energy and nutritional deﬁciency even though they use a major share of their income for these purposes. They mostly have a single source of income which is derived majorly from selling manual labour in the agriculture sector. Women, half of the population, are relatively less active in the labour force. And women of ultra poor households are forced to be engaged in the agricultural sector as agricultural day labourers receiving a discriminatory wage in normal and lean seasons compared to male labour. [Location] is India’s second most impoverished state, home to more than 500,000 households living in ultra-poverty. The challenges of these families go beyond ensuring 2 meals a day. Not only are they food insecure but also not have productive assets like land or livestock. They are socially excluded, ﬁnancially excluded, do not have access to predictable labour and income, nor are they able to access health, government, or community support programs. In 2017 [Client Organization] decided to work with such ultra-poor households through their livelihood project titled [Client’s Program] program in [Location]. The End Ultra-Poverty program aims to pull 1M women from ultra-poor households out of ultra-poverty in the next 5 years by improving social, economic, and gender-based outcomes through the evidence-based graduation approach. The [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program works with ultra-poor rural households, speciﬁcally with women from particularly vulnerable tribal groups living in the interiors of [Location] and help them to graduate out of ultra poverty. The core objective of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program is to pull one million women from ultra-poor households and alleviate them from ultra-poverty within the next ﬁve years by enhancing social, economic, and gender-speciﬁc outcomes through the evidence-backed graduation approach. Achieving its objectives, the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program requires addressing several constraints and barriers that ultra-poor households in the region face, both internally, within the household, and externally, at the community and environmental level such as lack of assets, skills sets and basic services, and low levels of voice and empowerment of household members, lack of service providers, limited markets, restricted livelihood options. In order to achieve its objectives, the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program has devised a sequenced and multifaceted interventions to tackle these constraints and barriers. These interventions enable families to come out of ultra-poverty sustainably in a deﬁned time period, attempting to ensure that the beneﬁciaries are not excluded either socially or ﬁnancially at the end of the program. The program facilitates regular hand holding (i.e., practice of providing consistent and supportive guidance, mentorship that the program offers to project participants) at the centre of its success. The ultra-poor are highly food insecure and hence the program starts with providing &amp;#x27;breathing space&amp;#x27; by ensuring food 1 Lipton (1986) deﬁned ultra poor as “a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements despite spending at least 80% of income on food”; Lipton, Michael, (1986). “Seasonality and Ultra Poverty.” IDS Bulletin 17.3, Institute of Development Studies. http://www.ids.ac.uk/ﬁles/dmﬁle/Lipton17.3ﬁnal.pdf Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

CMS is a strong proponent of building evidence and innovations to guide development. Our team excels in customising evaluative studies to be gender-transformative, integrating theories of change, alternate analysis, and results frameworks with a keen focus on inclusivity. We are adept at employing pluralistic methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative techniques, to ensure a holistic understanding of the impact on various gender groups. The team specialises in designing and executing monitoring systems, evaluations, and impact assessments in multiple domains, with a variety of partners (multilaterals, bilateral, government, non-government organisations, faith-based organisations, community-based organisations, network organisations and social movements) using a host of methodologies such as experimental, quasi-experimental, mixed-method and qualitative methods. Our experience spans nationally and internationally, and we are skilled in using evidence to shape policies and enhance program strategies, particularly those related to gender equality and women&amp;#x27;s empowerment. The team proposed for this study is a part of the NRLP evaluations over the last 5-7 years and has a nuanced understanding of the ecosystem including the livelihood cadres, institutional structure. Our close collaboration with MORD and SRLMS, including JSLPS, provides a solid foundation for evaluating gender-transformative interventions within the NRLM ecosystem. The team has a dedicated base of local ﬁeld researchers well-versed with the NRLM ecosystem. Our advisor and team include gender experts, persons who have worked on evaluations in the NRLM and gender context, bringing a gender lens to the evaluation process, recognizing and addressing the unique challenges and opportunities that individuals of different genders face within the context of policies and programs. They have demonstrated excellence in bridging the evaluation gap, speciﬁcally focusing on the inadequacies in producing and utilising evidence in the design and implementation of policies and programs. Our advisors have delved into the effectiveness of market-led development approaches, with a keen eye on the gender dynamics involved. For instance, they have explored the impact of community-based producer organisations, appropriate business training, information sharing about markets, and asset transfer/ﬁnancial support from a gender lens. Moreover, our advisors boast extensive experience in qualitative research, and their domain expertise extends to the nuanced realm of women livelihoods and empowerment. They bring a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities faced by women in livelihoods (entrepreneurial/agriculture/labour) endeavours, ensuring that the evaluation process is attuned to the speciﬁc needs and contexts of programmes targeted towards women. This inclusive approach enhances the robustness and relevance of the evaluation ﬁndings, providing insights that are sensitive to gender disparities and contributing to the advancement of gender equality in policy and program implementation. Rooted in a profound understanding of poverty alleviation and the unique challenges faced by the ultra-poor, our team of researchers and practitioners combines hands-on experience in navigating poverty reduction initiatives with a nuanced perspective gained from working with market-led models and large-scale government poverty alleviation programs. This dual expertise informs our approach to Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Our team, proﬁcient in statistical techniques as well as qualitative methods and analytical frameworks, leverages this expertise to design a comprehensive study. The team&amp;#x27;s access to various groups within the NRLMs ecosystem forms the basis for crafting a thorough research approach. CMS has strategically assembled a team of experts for the current study, each contributing unique experiences: ● Deep expertise in poverty alleviation, encompassing areas related to ﬁnancial inclusion, access to resources, and the effective utilisation of digital technology for capacity building. Proven track record in strategy development and policy shaping for NGOs, INGOs, and multilateral organisations. ● Successful collaboration with esteemed entities such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), UNDP, DFID, and others. Demonstrated ability to engage effectively with a diverse range of organisations, including community-based organisations, government bodies, and NGOs, making us a trusted partner at various levels. ● Possession of an in-house ﬁeld research infrastructure spanning across India, with a focus on conducting primary surveys and interviews. Decades of on-the-ground experience in different geographies across India, facilitated by our extensive network and ﬁeld presence. One of the core expertise that we bring is inhouse data collection experience maintaining stringent quality control protocols and assurance standards since we understand that quality ﬁeld data collection is fundamental to quality research and evaluations that drive effective decision making. Some of the quality assurance mechanisms followed by the Community engagement team are as follows: a. CMS prioritises local expertise by ensuring that 100% of ﬁeld researchers are local, possessing a deep understanding of language, dialects, customs, and culture, fostering a stronger connection with respondents. Ethical considerations are central to CMS&amp;#x27;s approach, with ﬁeld researchers certiﬁed in &amp;quot;Research Ethics&amp;quot; through reputable institutions like UNICEF-Agora, Citi, or FHI360. Rigorous internal veriﬁcation processes, including assessments of research ethics and strong references, guide the recruitment of ﬁeld staff. Thematic and domain expertise are crucial criteria, with CMS recruiting individuals with a minimum of two years of experience relevant to the research topic and target audience. Gender balance is maintained based on study requirements, exempliﬁed in the NRLP SHG follow-up study where a mix of male and female enumerators and supervisors are chosen, factoring in prior experience with SHGs, Aajeevika, or NRLM Projects. b. Quality control is a fundamental aspect of the research process, implemented at every stage to minimise errors in data collection. Internal and external measures are employed to ensure &amp;#x27;data conﬁdence&amp;#x27; and validate the authenticity of the collected data. Spot checks, undertaken by ﬁeld supervisors on 15% of samples, verify adherence to ﬁeld protocols and data quality Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 --- Page 8 --- during actual data collection. Daily back checks review 5% of respondents&amp;#x27; data for key indicators to maintain data quality. Investigators review of ﬁlled questionnaires ensures consistency, logic, and completeness, with revisits conducted if necessary. Fieldwork progress is tracked through weekly movement plans, shared with program managers for monitoring, and the survey progresses with teams covering two self-help groups per day. As ‘Solvists’ CMS has skin in the game. We approach development challenges with empathy and think out of the box to design and implement people-centred models in our engagements and interventions. Our expertise in research and evidence uptake with relevant stakeholders, in-house data collection, pathways for scaling up models, the domain of livelihoods with a gender-lens approach (agriculture, livestock, women’s collective institutions), makes CMS well-equipped to deliver a gender-transformative evaluation design for the proposed study. Our commitment to inclusive methodologies, gender-responsive research, and rigorous quality control positions us as a trusted partner in advancing gender equality and empowerment within the scope of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] project. 2.2 Relevant evaluation and domain experience CMS has extensive experience designing and delivering rigorous high-quality research and evidence generation engagements, community needs assessments, large-scale mixed method, experimental / quasi-experimental designs (using econometric techniques such as randomised control trials, matched pairs, difference in differences etc.), and participatory methods such as PRA, ethnographic studies, developmental evaluations etc. (using life stories, participatory rural appraisals), in a variety of domains (education, agriculture, microﬁnance, health and livelihoods). Details of contract and award details can be provided when shortlisted. To demonstrate the research and evaluation team&amp;#x27;s capacity to achieve the expected outcomes of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program, we present a list of our research experience that is closely aligned with the objectives of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] project. Recently, the team concluded the ﬁrst phase of evaluation of a national government program in India, the National Rural Livelihood Project (NRLP) working on women empowerment and decision making within the household through access to credit. Employing a gendered lens, the study utilised rigorous research methodologies to assess the impact of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) programs and institutional support for women, with a primary goal of fostering sustainable livelihoods and ﬁnancial inclusion. The study employed a range of robust methods to ensure the validity and reliability of the ﬁndings, and to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the program&amp;#x27;s effectiveness. A central focus of the evaluation was on studying the impact of the program on women&amp;#x27;s empowerment, aiming to uncover nuanced insights into how access to credit inﬂuences gender dynamics within households and contributes to the broader goal of empowering women economically and socially. This evaluation will provide valuable insights into the program&amp;#x27;s effectiveness from a gender perspective, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable assessment of NRLP&amp;#x27;s impact. The team is now in the second phase of evaluation of NRLP, the focus is speciﬁcally directed towards assessing the impact on women&amp;#x27;s empowerment within the context of livelihoods. Employing a comprehensive gender lens, the evaluation extends beyond examining the effects of credit and ﬁnancial inclusion, delving into the broader spectrum of initiatives across all program verticals. This encompasses a nuanced examination of the impact on women livelihood programmes within farm enterprises, including Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

[Client Organization] is partnering with NRLM and respective SRLMs to directly implement the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program through a graduation approach in the states of [Location], Rajasthan, Assam, and Tripura. However, [Client Organization] wants to conduct an evaluation of outcomes from a gender lens for the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program only in [Location]. The outputs of the evaluation will be used to create a blueprint to make the implementation of the graduation approach more gender intentional. The Ultra-Poor (UP) households can be characterised through the Venn diagram shown below. The objective of the study is to evaluate the program design and delivery from a lens of gender with a focus on identifying not just the impact of the program on gender but also to recommend what can be redesigned/incorporated to amplify the current program outcomes and improve program sustainability. 3.2 Our understanding of the Project The program focuses on highly vulnerable and marginalised groups, including particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), scheduled tribes (ST), and scheduled castes (SC), who are socially and geographically excluded, lacking land and productive assets. It employs a sequential, multifaceted intervention approach based on the graduation model. This involves meeting basic needs by providing consumption allowances, creating diversiﬁed livelihood plans for households, and offering grants for asset creation and training in technical skills. Social empowerment is fostered through ongoing skill development, coaching, and support for micro-enterprises. Financial support is provided through the formation of women-based Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to encourage savings and access to credit. The program primarily targets women, aiming to bring positive change to their families. The programme objectives also include “ while ensuring that the didis are neither socially nor ﬁnancially excluded at the end of the program”. and the delivery model puts women at the centre. Program objectives emphasise identifying and addressing gender inequalities, gender-based constraints, and inequitable norms and Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

To enhance gender intentionality, the program seeks to address gender inequalities and norms, making the overall approach more inclusive and equitable. The implementation phase involves a gender-focused study to inform a gender-transformative evaluation design for the program&amp;#x27;s continuous improvement. Hence a gender-transformative evaluation design is needed which will be iterative in nature &amp;amp; ‘formative’ more than a summative evaluation. In order to carry out a robust evaluation of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program i.e., methodology plan including sampling, data collection, and analysis methods proposed the following sets of assumptions needs to hold true. Assumption 1: A detailed sample universe for the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program in [Location] is available, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the program&amp;#x27;s scope and impact. Assumption 2: Information about the geography in [Location] is accessible, providing a foundation for context-speciﬁc analysis and evaluation. Assumption 3: A detailed program timeline for the implementation of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program is established, aligned with the three-year sequenced intervention as mentioned in RFP. Assumption 4: The UPAJ Project is considered a part of the [Client’s Program] program, indicating continuity in geography and stakeholders involved in [Location]. 3.3 Technical Approach and Methodology 3.3.1. Study Approach This evaluation aims to assess the impact of the programme&amp;#x27;s design and implementation on gender-based outcomes, while also developing recommendations to enhance the program&amp;#x27;s effectiveness, and future sustainability. To this end, the nature of the study needs to be both formative , i.e., contribute to design and implementation iterations at multiple stages, and summative , i.e., evaluate the impact on the deﬁned programme outcomes at regular intervals. The ultimate goal of the initiative is to enable households to come out of ultra poverty, while placing women right at the centre of its delivery model. Women of these households ( didis ) are the intended drivers of the change, fostered through a multifaceted action strategy built upon t he graduation approach . However, to ensure gender equity and long-term impact sustainability, it is crucial that these Didi&amp;#x27;s go beyond being mere instruments of change for their families and are empowered to cultivate agency and strive for an improved quality of life for themselves as well. Therefore, it is critical to employ a gendered lens in the re-examination of the programmatic theory of change, intervention design, delivery models and overall impact. The evaluation design should be rooted in feminist principles 2 , while also being mindful of the existing intersectionality as the program speciﬁcally focuses on families from economically, socially, and geographically marginalised communities. The proposed study approach will follow the core tenets of feminist and gender-based evaluations , including but not limited to: 2 Whynot, Jane. &amp;quot;Sharon Brisolara, Denise Seigart, &amp;amp; Saumitra SenGupta (Eds.).(2014).

We intend to embed these principles throughout the three-year evaluation process and aim to develop a gender-transformative evaluation approach, phased out into the following stages. Secondary Review (Months 0-2) As the ﬁrst step, we will try to bring in learnings and insights through an in-depth review of relevant literature, including, but not limited to: ● Peer-reviewed articles in academic journals on similar topics ● Assessment reports of programmes similar in scope and/or with a gender-focus ● Gender concepts and theories, with case studies of similar regions / populations ● Handbooks/toolkits designed by local, national, and international development research agencies to engender conceptual and evaluation frameworks. This exercise will better prepare us to reexamine the programme and its activities through a gendered lens 3 , through the review of programme documents 4 such as: ● Detailed theory of change (problem statement, inputs, activities, outputs, term-based outcomes, and impact) - are the pathways of change cognizant of different practical realities (e.g., social biases, discrimination, power imbalances) of women? Are potential negative impacts on women considered in the design and delivery (for e.g., increase in women’s workload)? Are the positive impacts (for e.g., increased food security) equitable for all members of the household? ● Programme strategy and progress reports ● Past research and assessment reports ● Programme monitoring data (MIS) 4 Subject to availability. Otherwise, we will attempt to collect the same insights through engagement with the programme team. 3 These questions are only indicative. An exhaustive set of such questions will be developed during the study at relevant stages. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

It will also help us determine if the programme design is gender-instrumental, gender-sensitive or gender-transformative. Engendering the Program m atic Logical Fram ew ork The logical framework , or log frame, has established the logical linkages connecting the [Client’s Program] programme’s means (inputs and activities) with its ends (outputs and outcomes), and their means of veriﬁcation (tools and indicators). It details short term outputs, intermediate and long-term outcomes, along with the indicative metrics / indicators. It will serve as a main summary of the project, and used for planning, implementation, and subsequently used to design the overall monitoring and evaluation framework. To facilitate gender transformative implementation and evaluation, it is essential to engender it using iterative and participatory processes (with programme team, implementation partners, gender experts, community leaders, and beneﬁciary groups. The engendering process seeks to recognise and address gender inequities speciﬁc to Didis , both within and outside their households. This involves integrating an understanding of social and gender relations into the project implementation. By adopting a gendered perspective, we will examine the socially constructed disparities, such as norms and access barriers, between Didis and their male household members, as well as among Didis from various communities. These distinctions play a crucial role in determining the extent to which women face limitations in accessing and controlling resources, experience varied constraints and opportunities in society, whether at the household, community, or state level - ultimately impacting their ability to realise the beneﬁts (outcomes) through participating in programme’s activities. As the ﬁrst step, the log frame will be engendered by reﬂecting on a series of questions across each element of its design - long term objectives, intermediate outcomes, outputs and activities. These are tabulated below: Activities Outputs Intermediate Outcomes Long-term Outcomes Summary Are underlying gender issues, particularly among PVTGs identiﬁed / accounted for while implementation planning? (eg. work plans) Are the identiﬁed differences accounted for while designing programme activities? Does the distribution of beneﬁts take gender roles and gender power dynamics into account? Does the project have gender- responsive objective(s) - i.e. do they aim to address gender norms and barriers? Do gender relations in any way inﬂuence the project goals?

Do delivery of inputs account for Didi’s access and control over the HH resources? What measures can verify if beneﬁts accrue to Didi’s as well as other members affected by the project? What measures can verify achievement of the gender- responsive/transformative objective(s)? What measures can verify achievement of the gender- responsive/transformative goal? Methods / Mode of veriﬁcation Is the programmatic data (MIS) for the household, and any other data collected aggregated by gender? What gender analysis concepts &amp;amp; tools will be used (e.g., in monitoring the activities)? Is the programmatic data (MIS) for the household, and any other data collected aggregated by gender? What gender analysis concepts and methods tools will be used (e.g., in participatory ﬁeld evaluations)? Is the programmatic data (MIS) for the household, and any other data collected aggregated by gender? What gender analysis concepts and methods tools will be used (e.g., in Rapid Rural Appraisal exercises)? Is the programmatic data (MIS) for the household, and any other data collected aggregated by gender? What gender analysis concepts and methods tools will be used? (e.g., in Impact assessment)? Assumptions and Risks What are the external factors necessary to achieve delivery of activities ensuring the continued engagement of Didi’s in these activities? What are the important external factors necessary for the engagement in activities to translate to achievement of short-term outcomes? What are the important external factors necessary for sustaining gender responsive outputs / outcomes? What are the important external factors necessary for sustaining the gender-responsive goal? By reﬂecting on these questions in the context of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] programme, we have, to some extent, engendered the draft log frame shared by the programme team. This will be detailed out after inception meeting with programme team, implementation partners, review of previous research conducted on the programme, and secondary research.

This would also allow us the opportunity for clariﬁcations, and/or get more details, if required. These ﬁeld immersion visits will be mainly conducted in the graduated cohort, with some interactions with current programme beneﬁciaries. The goal will be to engage with and collect data from them to broadly assess the level of impact of the programme, the pathways to change, the impact on women, speciﬁcally on their empowerment and well-being, identify gaps in design and implementation - and draw out learnings crucial to initiate the iterative design process. These engagements will be structured as in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs), and conducted with both men, women, and mixed groups (for FGDs) . This is crucial as it helps us gauge comprehension, cultural-gender norms &amp;amp; gender power dynamics, and design our framework and tools considering these nuances. Each member of the core team, accompanied by data collectors (with gender sensitivity training) will be a part of the ﬁeld visits, and participate in these engagements. Most, if not all, of these tools will be participatory in nature. We intend to utilise participatory evaluation tools such as Economic Ranking of Households, Asset Ownership Mapping, Decision Making Matrix, etc . to grasp their perception of economic mobility, ownership of assets and the ability to make decisions related to livelihoods, income, and expenditure. These insights are essential for a comprehensive understanding of on ground realities and guide the development of engendered evaluation outcomes 5 , indicators, and data collection tools. Evaluation Framework Design (Months 4-5) Building on the learnings from primary and secondary review conducted in the preceding months, we will develop the conceptual framework of the programme, engendered theory of change and evaluation framework comprising the key evaluation questions, relevant indicators, and metrics, required data collection tool, and the analytical schema . The framework and tools will be developed by researchers trained in designing &amp;amp; facilitating gender transformative evaluations, with the guidance of industry leaders &amp;amp; gender experts with decades of expertise conducting evaluation of large-scale livelihood development programmes, such as National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), with particular focus on women. The overall evaluation framework of the programme will draw from multiple existing frameworks, such as Change Matrix (Adp. Batliwala(Rao and Kelleher, 2008)), Making the Case (Women’s Funding Network, 2004), Gender, Empowerment &amp;amp; Poverty Reduction Framework (Sen ‘81, Rowlands ‘97), Social Inclusion/Exclusion Framework (Sen, 2000); bringing together constructs most relevant to assessing various lines of enquiry emerging from key evaluation questions. We’ll also include fundamental gender analysis concepts in both evaluation and analytical framework such as: ● Gender based division of labour. ● Gender based access, ownership, and control over resources. ● Gender based decision making; &amp;amp; ● Empowerment across gender identities 5 Through these interactions, we will engender the pre-deﬁned programme outcomes (Appendix 2), and identify relevant indicators, if more.

The criteria for assessment covers: ● Relevance: To what extent are the intervention objectives and design responding to the needs of the beneﬁciaries? Do they also recognise &amp;amp; address the speciﬁc needs of women beneﬁciaries? ● Effectiveness: To what extent has the intervention achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives, and its results, including any differential results across groups? What can be the underlying cause for differential impact? ● Efﬁciency: To what extent does the intervention deliver, or is likely to deliver, results in an economic and timely way? ● Impact: To what extent has the intervention generated or is expected to generate signiﬁcant positive or negative, intended, or unintended, higher-level effects? Is this impact equitable across gender and caste groups (and their intersectionality), or are there any structural/design gaps to deliver the same? ● Sustainability: To what extent will the net beneﬁts of the intervention continue, or are likely to continue? Are the programme activities contributing to shifts in gender power dynamics to make the change sustainable for women? ● Coherence: How well does the intervention ﬁt with other interventions in the country, sector, or institution? Is there internal coherence within programme interventions, and external coherence with other systemic and institutional efforts towards gender equity? Data Collection, Monitoring &amp;amp; Quality Assurance (Months 6; 12-30; 34-35) We will design mixed-methods surveys/ interviews to investigate evaluation questions in tandem with the ﬁnalised evaluation framework. The data collection and the evaluation will be taken under three focus areas of, Baseline evaluation (month 6), periodic evaluation (month 12-30) and endline evaluation (month 34-35). All the three components will follow a non-experimental mixed-method design collecting longitudinal data from the programme beneﬁciaries for the next three years. Survey data along with the comprehensive review of all other quantitative information in combination with a comprehensive review of project documents (annual reports, results framework, annual reports, MIS data, rounds of lean survey data) will give us a strong understanding of the effectiveness, efﬁciency, and impact of the program. The survey data across various phases of evaluation will focus on change in livelihoods of Ultra-Poor HHs in the areas: income, expenditures, savings, and assets. The detailed outcome indicator list (as per RFP) for 3-year-long carefully sequenced interventions under [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] is attached in Annexure 1. We propose a technology led-monitoring system for the programme, while not mentioned in the RFP, the evaluation team would be happy to work together with the programme team on continuous MIS data systems generating real-time dashboards. We also propose that numbers from baseline, periodic assessments, and continuous programme data be a part of one dashboard that showcases the programme snapshot at any given point in time. 7 https://www.uneval.org/document/detail/980 6 https://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/revised-evaluation-criteria-dec-2019.pdf Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

Each method contributes validity to the results, but the extent varies under speciﬁc circumstances. The most rigorous approach for evaluating and attributing the program&amp;#x27;s impact on the elicited outcome is through Experimental Design, speciﬁcally a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). However, due to the nature of the assignment, the program implementation began in December 2023/January 2024, with the purposeful selection of intervention districts, blocks, and villages based on [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]&amp;#x27;s assessment in [Location]. This precludes any opportunity for random allocation of villages or women to the intervention, making it impractical to utilize the power of experimental design in this context. The constraints arise from the inability to implement random selection and assignment, limiting the feasibility of employing experimental design in this speciﬁc scenario. Consequently, we suggest the following approaches, which can be ﬁnalized contingent upon data availability and mutual agreement. The methodologies outlined below are informed by our interpretation of the RFP, the information currently at our disposal, and initial discussions with the [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] team. As for the budget, we have assumed that sampling can be executed in a manner allowing for the proposal and implementation of either methodology within the conﬁnes of the existing budget. Quantitative Approach 1: Non-Experimental Design (Pre-Post Tests) The feasibility of evaluating the program&amp;#x27;s impact hinges on the availability of existing data concerning its beneﬁciaries and the potential to construct credible counterfactual control groups using econometric techniques. In this case, obtaining suitable comparison groups in a quasi-experimental design proves challenging due to the intervention&amp;#x27;s nature and program focus. In light of these considerations, we recommend adopting a pre-test post-test non-experimental design, where selected participants represent the population across different criteria. This design allows for measurement before and after treatment, providing insights into whether beneﬁciaries have achieved the identiﬁed outcomes. However, a challenge associated with this approach is the issue of internal validity, given the observation of the same participants over time. Drawing on our experience, a thorough examination of project documents (such as annual reports, results frameworks, Management Information System (MIS) data, and past survey data) can offer a robust understanding of the program&amp;#x27;s effectiveness, efﬁciency, and impact. Combining survey data with a comprehensive review of quantitative information will furnish strong evidence and insights into the program&amp;#x27;s effectiveness, impact, sustainability, and coherence based on the OECD-DAC (REEISC) framework. The team will employ a multi-phase sampling technique while selecting the districts, blocks, and villages in [Location]. The indicators for targeting the numbers of districts, blocks, and villages will be identiﬁed in consultation with T/NI based on the initial ﬁeld immersion and understanding of the program participants by CMS. The villages will be randomly selected based on the maturity/adoption of the [CLIENT’S Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The identiﬁcation of targeted districts, blocks, villages will ensure that the sample selected at various phases of study has enough variation to draw insights from the diversity of respondents. The tentative sample size for the non-experimental design (ongoing cohort) is approximately 600. We aim to track all program participants in the aforementioned cohort (9) throughout the evaluation. Considering, the cohort size, and including for attrition and design effects, we would propose to sample the full cohort of 600 women. Following the full cohort would also help us run some meaningful advance statistical tests. Quantitative Approach 2: Quasi Experimental (Difference-in-Difference with Matching) This approach relies on the presence of a control group. As the program is currently underway with speciﬁc cohort (cohort 9), this cohort serves as the treatment group in our approach. Our understanding suggests that the program employs selection criteria for enrolment or planning future cohorts within the same state. The evaluation team intends to select a control group from the program enrolment data, representing individuals who would have been part of the current cohort sample if the programme participation had not been restricted. This would also include the variable on their willingness to join the programme. Alternatively, if plans exist for future cohorts, the control group will be selected from these. The control group of target women will be matched for similar socio-demographic proﬁles, age, economic conditions, and other relevant factors to the treatment group. Assuming a baseline study will be conducted during the program period, we propose utilising the difference-in-differences of matched pairs to assess the program&amp;#x27;s impact by analysing the difference between baseline and endline. Matched pairs will be formed based on pre-program baseline values of indicators inﬂuencing women&amp;#x27;s participation, such as education, age, family size, asset holdings, among others. Paired women from the treatment and control groups will be tracked during the endline and serve as a valid counterfactual for the treatment unit undergoing training and other services provided by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]. The difference-in-differences method leverages two levels of differences: one based on the survey time (baseline and endline) and the other based on the treatment provided by the [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] team. This methodology yields program effects as the difference in outcomes between endline and baseline surveys in the treatment group, after subtracting the same difference in control units. The counterfactual or control group for women in the program will be formed through matching due to the absence of random treatment allocation. The assumption is that the change in outcomes in treatment units would have been identical to that in control units in the absence of the program. If this assumption holds, any additional change in outcomes in treatment units can be attributed to the program. The baseline data from the [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] program team will be used to match the treatment and control groups based on initial outcome variables in 2024 (according to the baseline study timeline) and variables affecting program participation, using matching algorithms. However, the ﬁnal methodology will be developed and agreed upon based on available information and discussions with [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 --- Page 24 --- In the case of a quasi-experimental design, the indicative sample size will also be around 1200, with approximately 600 individuals in the treatment sample and 600 in the control group. Depending on the availability of information regarding control group (from programme selection data), we can adjust and update the sample size accordingly. Quantitative Approach 3: Case control Case Control is a retrospective quantitative methodology which ﬁrst identiﬁes cases (groups) with different levels of exposure, and then studies the differences in contextual factors which foster or inhibit the achievement of these outcomes. It is designed to help determine if an exposure is associated with an outcome. The goal of this exercise will be to use the variability and variance in the programme exposure and intensity and investigate the impact of programmatic interventions (asset &amp;amp; cash transfer; hand holding &amp;amp; training; creating support systems; livelihood planning; facilitating access) have on the long term goals (improvement in nutrition &amp;amp; health outcomes, improvements in income, assets and savings; improved social inclusion and protection- particularly for Didis), that is, what are the odds that the delivery of interventions will lead to graduation (as envisioned in the programmatic theory of change?). To this end, our ﬁrst step would be identiﬁcation and creation of groups with different levels of exposure to these activities, in terms of both intensity and ﬁdelity; and the level of change in terms of the deﬁned intermediate/long term outcomes. These categories will be created through the use of MIS and other process monitoring data to investigate the differential results in terms of: 1. Fidelity : How well did the implementation/delivery follow the protocols, timelines and workplan across beneﬁciaries? 2. Intensity: What was the frequency, duration, and engagement in these programmatic activities? In this context, exposure to [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] programme is looked at from the lens as intensity of the programme delivery. Case refers to instances where the outcome was observed and control where the outcome was not. The below matrix is prepared to represent the number of units following under all combinations of case/control and exposure/no exposure. The deﬁnition of exposure and beneﬁt needs to be clearly deﬁned (it could also be a composite index). Exposure No Exposure Beneﬁt a b No Beneﬁt c d The odds ratio is calculated as follows (a*d / b*c) which shows the increase/decrease in the likelihood of reaching the outcomes. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Similarly, realisation of beneﬁts across both groups is essential to bring balance in the case control matrix. The distribution of the population under each quadrant of the case control matrix should be well balanced to derive the best results out of this approach. However, the presence of the differential outcomes and exposure do not always ensure the applicability of this approach, these should be observable and measurable by research for this method to be employed. Based on the collected data and distribution of the same across the 2*2 matrix of beneﬁt and exposure, the odds ratio is calculated. Odds ratio indicates the probability of realising outcomes given that they were exposed to the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] programme. Through this approach, we would be able to better understand the differential level of impact and variability within the programme, the reasons (causes) behind them, and determine what additional support can be added to the programme design to improve the effectiveness and impact of its activities. We would propose to survey the full cohort of 600 for the case control method. This would be done at endline. Qualitative approach Given the complex, multidimensional nature of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] program and gender sensitivities involved, a qualitative method is being included in the design to deepen understanding of women’s views and experiences, their relationship to the program’s theory of change and the nuances of gender-transformative changes. Evaluations combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies are referred to as ‘mixed methods. From the multiple schema that can be used for categorising mixed methods, we propose adopting a ‘Sequential Connecting Strategy’. This approach comprises of one method being applied sequentially after the other, with the ﬁndings from each method connecting to the next. The primary (quantitative) method for the evaluation will be followed by the secondary (qualitative) method. Sequential models are preferred, when there is sufﬁcient time to conduct more than one round of ﬁeld survey, because they make it possible for the results of one method to inform the other. In this evaluation the main evaluation questions will be answered by the quantitative method and the qualitative method will be employed for complementarity (elaboration, enhancement, illustration, and clariﬁcation of the results from the quantitative method), focusing on developing insights into ﬁndings that need greater exploration. While the quantitative study will provide data and analysis related to the extent of impact and its attributability (if quasi experimental approach is followed), the qualitative design provides ‘in-depth’ information on ‘why’ and ‘how’ of the changes. There is also a development purpose, where the quantitative method ﬁndings will be used to design the qualitative study which included sampling and inputs to the analytic framework. Given the sequential Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Purpose of the qualitative method 1 Triangulation Seeking convergence and corroboration of results from different methods and designs studying the same phenomenon 2 Complementarity Seeking elaboration, enhancement, illustration, and clariﬁcation of the results from one method with results from the other method 3 Initiation Discovering paradoxes and contradictions that lead to a re-framing of the research question 4 Development Using the ﬁndings from one method to help inform the other method 5 Expansion Seeking to expand the breadth and range of research by using different methods for different inquiry components 6 Concordance and Discordance Exploring the nature of differences, if any, in opinions, experiences, perceptions, using different methods Shaded cells show the purpose for this study We propose that the quantitative data could divided into the following quartiles, and qualitative samples would be selected from Cohorts Programme Intensity &amp;amp; Fidelity (Inputs) Index (PI) Outcome Index (OI) (Intermediate) Household Cohort 1 Lowest Quartile Lowest Quartile Household Cohort 2 Third Quartile Third Quartile Household Cohort 3 Second Quartile Second Quartile Household Cohort 4 First Quartile First Quartile The lowest and the highest quartiles in terms of lower levels of achievements in both PI and OI can be considered for qualitative sampling for identifying variances and understanding nuances. Within these quartiles, we can identify individual case studies for an in-depth exploration of their journeys through the programme period. Once identiﬁed, we will investigate the potential factors: demographics, socio-economic status, education, age, household size, leadership status, proximity to markets, etc, in addition to exploring other factors relevant in the causal chain from activities to impact: gender ratio, division of labor, self-conﬁdence &amp;amp; agency (women), control over resources (women), decision making ability &amp;amp; power, etc. Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

The details of stakeholder wise and cohort wise break-up can be decided at a later stage. This integrated approach (quantitative and qualitative analysis) aligns with our commitment to conducting a thorough gender-sensitive evaluation, providing actionable recommendations for the program&amp;#x27;s reﬁnement and expansion/scale. This will produce a credible, evidence-based narrative of contribution to the intervention. Further, the proposed evaluations prioritise a shift from attributing roles based on gender to valuing and recognizing the diverse and meaningful contributions of individuals such as in empowerment, agency, inclusion, respecting individual identities etc. This not only aligns with principles of equality and justice but also fosters a more inclusive and empowering evaluation framework. Quantitative surveys with 50 households will be conducted in each period assessment. Qualitative interviews and FGDs would also be conducted women with the earlier cohorts, who have graduated for understanding differential impact and nuances in programme. These could be conducted during periodic assessments where we propose 8 FGDs and 15 IDIs to be conducted in each round. These are indicative numbers and can be detailed out at a later stage. Both the quantitative surveys and the qualitative interviews and explorations will be new in each periodic assessment to cover/reach a larger programme sample at regular intervals (apart from baseline, endline). To evaluate the program design and delivery from a lens of gender and the impact of the program on gender, data collection will happen in a phased manner at various stages as depicted below. # Phase Tools Used &amp;amp; Respondent Total Sample 0 Primary Review/Immersion Visit FGDs with all women, all men groups, and mixed groups 10 groups IDIs with women beneﬁciaries and other identiﬁed stakeholders 5 1 Baseline (Month 5-6) Quantitative Surveys 1200 (Group) Economic ranking; decision making matrix; Asset ownership mapping 20 groups IDIs with women beneﬁciaries and other identiﬁed stakeholders 45 2 Periodic Assessments 8 (Starting at month 12, bi-annually; 4 rounds of data collection, once in 6 month) Quantitative Survey with Beneﬁciaries ( Didis ) 200 (50 in each round) FGDs with women beneﬁciaries 48 groups (8 in each round) IDIs with women beneﬁciaries and other identiﬁed stakeholders 75 (15 in each round) 3 Endline Quantitative Survey with the same beneﬁciaries as endline 1200 8 Periodic experiments mentioned by T/NI in the RFP are not included in these assessments at present.

The detailed sampling framework regarding the rationale for each stage of data collection is attached in annexure 2. Quantitative Analysis Data cleaning is a crucial step that directly inﬂuences the quality of our analyses. We follow a careful and thorough approach, addressing issues like checking ID variables, tagging outliers, handling missing values, and ﬁxing logical inconsistencies in real-time. We document any irregularities and corrections, making changes only after discussing with the ﬁeld team and considering qualitative insights. After collecting any set of data, our team will carry out a comprehensive process that includes cleaning, preparing, and storing the data. We have a dedicated team of data experts working closely with the CMS team dedicated to reﬁning all data related processes. During the analysis phase, we&amp;#x27;ll closely examine the ﬁeld data, have reﬂective sessions with our internal team, and discuss ﬁndings with the project team. Following data cleaning, our analysis team will lead the analysis in STATA or R, based on agreed speciﬁcations. A set of these protocols – for cleaning, management and analysis will be documented post deﬁning the analytical framework. Qualitative Analysis The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the FGDs, IDIs and KIIs using qualitative software such as Nvivo or Atlas.ti, using the following analytical techniques Narrative Analysis : As the IDI with UP households aims to capture their personal experience through stories and relevant instances, on skill development, livelihood enhancement, and overall perceptions. Narrative analysis will focus on how people expressed their feelings and what language they used while describing their experiences. Thematic Analysis : The IDI conducted with the operation teams and CBO Leaders will provide better understanding and insights into programme planning and implementation and further the progress, operational challenges, and subsequent course corrections. A thematic analysis will help identify the key themes for systemic understanding which may not be known earlier. Whereas the data from the FGDs, will be analysed through both content analysis and thematic analysis. Together they will help in identifying the key factors that beneﬁtted/ not- beneﬁted the UP household in terms of skill enhancement and other programme outcomes. Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

Preprocessing and Data Cleaning : We will begin by preparing the textual data for analysis. This initial step will involve tasks such as text cleaning, removal of stop words, and word stemming. The objective will be to enhance data quality and reduce noise. 2. Summarization and Concept Identiﬁcation: After preprocessing, we will generate a concise document summary. This summary will aid in identifying key concepts, outcomes, and causal links within the text. The subsequent task will involve identifying essential entities, ideas, or keywords using techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or keyword extraction. 3. Broad Theme Extraction and Clustering : We will expand our analysis to encompass broad themes. We will group related concepts into thematic clusters. This step will provide a higher-level understanding of the text&amp;#x27;s content. 4. Causal Relation Identiﬁcation and Mapping : At the core of the analysis, there will lie the identiﬁcation of causal relations. We will recognize sentences expressing these relationships, like &amp;quot;X leads to Y&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;A causes B.&amp;quot; Then, we will create a causal map, portraying these causal relationships as a network, where concepts will serve as nodes and causal links as edges. We will distinguish between causal conditions (factors leading to change) and outcomes (results of these conditions) to clarify cause-and-effect associations. 5. Formalization and Interpretation of relationships: To formalise the relationships, we will employ set theory by deﬁning sets for causal conditions and outcomes. For example, we will use &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; for causal conditions and &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; for outcomes. We will deﬁne relations within these sets to illustrate how conditions inﬂuence outcomes, potentially using arrows or mathematical symbols. We will also visualise the causal map for improved comprehension. This structured framework will provide a systematic approach to extract meaningful information from text, helping answer the identiﬁed research questions and evaluate the broad themes.

It will allow participants to co-create knowledge through the exchange of ideas, sentiments, and actionable insights. It will create a &amp;quot;Network of Knowledge&amp;quot;. Apurva’s multilingual and multimodal support will enable us to access the collective wisdom of beneﬁciaries and facilitate ideas, solutions, and innovations for the program more coherently. Apurva is built using a Large Language Model including GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Marqo, and Whisper. The overall ﬁndings can be ﬁnally put into case studies which may provide learning cases, comparative cases, and best cases. These cases will capture in-depth details of the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] journey, the implementation processes, the efﬁciency and effectiveness of processes and programmes and help in understanding the key inﬂuencing factors for sustainability. 3.3.4 Selection of Interviewers/Enumerators and the Content of their Training CMS has an expert network of senior enumerators with strong domain knowledge and experience of working in the development sector. They are also trained on research ethics and the collection of sensitive information, etc. The selection of enumerators is based on stringent measures, and they are assessed for quality throughout the project. Quality Researchers/Enumerators will be selected based on the following criteria: 1. Locally Sourced: CMS will ensure that 100% of ﬁeld researchers selected are local in nature. They know the language, dialect, customs, and culture. They also easily understand the local terminologies used, giving them a stronger connection and rapport between researcher and Respondents. 2. Ethically certiﬁed and Experienced: Field protocol of CMS ensures that ﬁeld researchers have completed the certiﬁcation of “Research Ethics&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; from either UNICEF-Agora or Citi or FHI360. The researchers selected will undergo various webinars, discussions, training on gender sensitivity &amp;amp; various research and ﬁeld-related topics. Only certiﬁed enumerators with a minimum of 2 years of experience will be recruited. 3. Gender Balance: Based on the nature of the study, CMS will ensure a balance of male and female enumerators to suit the study topic and the type of respondents. Given that the respondents are primarily females for the [CLIENT’S PROGRAM] study, a mix of male and female enumerators will be hired based on experience and ease of communication with the SHG members. . The team of supervisors for this study is a mix of males and female supervisors. The supervisor will shufﬂe the team as per the ground requirement. In this study, prior experience in working with SHGs, Aajeevika, or NRLM Projects will be preferred. 4. Tested and veriﬁed: CMS does a thorough internal veriﬁcation of ﬁeld staff, their nature, probing skills with projects. Those who are certiﬁed for research ethics in earlier studies or have strong references by CMS connections are only recruited for the study. 5. Thematic/Domain skills: As per the research topic and respondents’ type, CMS recruits only those who have a minimum of two years of work experience in the required domains and with the target audience.

Training will be provided on all aspects of data collection including programme background, objectives and scope of the study, sampling techniques and replacement methodology, discussion on each question with probing methods, logistics planning and support. Given the nature of the study and the respondent type, gender sensitivity training will be administered tailored to speciﬁc needs and the context of the study population. A scientiﬁc approach to the training process will be ensured by creating standard training protocols, manuals including standardisation in survey techniques. Mock surveys and ﬁeld days are planned for the team for in-ﬁeld experience with the software and survey tool. Further, the enumerators are trained to hold all biases, opinions, claims, and other features that can be associated with individuals. They will also sign a conﬁdentiality agreement with CMS agreeing to use conﬁdential information only for the purposes set out in the training, and not disclose the information to any other party. The enumerators will be trained on the understanding to not copy or retain or share any written information or record that could be associated with identifying features of individuals or identifying features of any sort, after the study period. And that at the conclusion of the surveys all conﬁdential information, including questionnaires, written notes, photographs, memoranda, or other types of notes taken to be given to the team. 3.3.5 Plan to Ensure Quality Data Collection and Management With over 200 projects and an in-house portfolio for data collection, CMS has strong expertise in ensuring quality data collection and follows strong protocols in the data collection process. The team has been following stringent guidelines around safety and hygiene, following international standards. 1. After the questionnaire is ﬁnalised in consultation with [Client Organization], researchers from the CMS team will conduct a pilot in the ﬁeld to ensure that the tool is well tailored to the location, project context as well as a cultural point of view. Once the post-pilot changes are completed, the tool is scripted and tested in-house (for skips and validations) by researchers and tested in a setting similar to that of the intended sample. 2. The ﬁnal questionnaire is translated into local language by experienced thematic translators to retain the essence and yet contextualise for the local language. Translated tools undergo a proofreading exercise to check the consistency and accuracy of the translation by the research team who is well versed in the local language. 3. Monitoring of data quality is the most important aspect of data collection. Poor quality data reduces the effectiveness of policy intervention and can also require a repeat of the entire data collection process. Therefore, the research team sets clear guidelines and protocols for the monitoring and quality assurance that include maintaining a real-time MIS dashboard of collection, minimising non-response with 2-3 attempts, ensuring enumerator quality controls with spot checks, back checks (on major topics, time taken, etc.) and looping mechanisms. 4. Data management is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect in the data collection process. The CMS team has robust processes, the quantitative data is stored online on secured servers synched in real-time that ensure data security. All hard copies of the research notes, qualitative interviews, etc. are scanned and uploaded almost in real-time to avoid any loss of data. The research team has Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Data cleaning is perhaps the most critical step between data collection and data analysis. CMS believes that it is a rigorous process, and that the quality of the analysis is correlated to the quality of data cleaning. Most of the data validation exercise is completed in real-time to avoid post-cleaning efforts including id variable checking, outlier tagging, missing values and replacements, illogical value assessment, addressing typos, survey codes, missing values and adding labels. Irregularities and corrections are identiﬁed and documented, but changes are made only after introspection with the ﬁeld team and the qualitative insights. 3.4 Work Plan The study will be rolled out in ten stages of Contracting &amp;amp; Inception Meeting (A), Secondary Review (B), Primary Review (C), Evaluation Design and Framework (D), Sampling and Tool Design (E), Survey operations (Baseline) (F), Data analysis and presentation (Baseline) (G), Survey operation and data analysis (Periodic Assessment) (H &amp;amp; I), Survey operation and data analysis (Endline) (J &amp;amp; K), Draft and Final report (L) . Overview of the work plan (Gantt Chart) with timelines is provided in Annexure-5. Stage 1: Contracting &amp;amp; Inception Meeting : The ﬁrst stage to get a good understanding of the expectations of the stakeholders, review of the project and other documents, and develop the overall evaluation framework and methods. The inception meeting will be held with the project staff and other key stakeholders to ﬁnalise the approach of the study, ideally within a week of the contract signing. The work will commence thereafter based on mutual understanding of the study. An inception report will be submitted at the end of this stage. The study team will also bring previous experience and learnings to better inform the study methodology for this phase. Stage 2: Secondary Review: Following the submission of the inception report, secondary review encompassing a literature review that will gather insights from peer-reviewed articles, assessment reports, gender concepts, theories, and case studies will be conducted for the initial two months. It will be followed with a meticulous examination of program documents, including the theory of change, strategy, progress reports, past research, and program monitoring data. Finally, we will synthesise ﬁndings, formulate targeted lines of enquiry, and determine the program&amp;#x27;s classiﬁcation as gender-instrumental, gender-sensitive, or gender-transformative. The overarching goal is to get a good understanding of the project and develop the overall evaluation framework and methods that is more gender-intentional, fostering inclusivity, and maximising its impact. Stage 3: Primary Review: A month-long primary review process focused on deepening understanding and assessing the T/NI program&amp;#x27;s impact through direct engagement with program teams and immersive ﬁeld visits will be undertaken. The ﬁeld immersion visit will enable us to understand participants&amp;#x27; perceptions of economic mobility and decision-making. Followed by debrieﬁng with the Impact team at [Client Organization]. The direct interactions with program teams will provide insights into their experiences and activities ensuring a nuanced understanding of on-the-ground realities, contributing to a comprehensive program assessment.

This will involve crafting an engendered theory of change and an evaluation framework encompassing key evaluation questions, pertinent indicators, metrics, and specialised data collection tools. This phase will culminate in the ﬁnalisation of the evaluation framework, that not only assesses program impact but also contributes to shifting gender power dynamics for sustainable change. Stage 5: Sampling and Tool Design: In this stage the methodology plan for the evaluation will be ﬁnalised incorporating a comprehensive sampling strategy for diverse representation. Both quantitative and qualitative tools, including an intersectionality tool, the Decision-Making matrix will be developed to analyse power dynamics and gender considerations within the program&amp;#x27;s decision-making processes. Translation, digitization, and pretesting of the evaluation tools will promptly follow the submission of the inception report. This phase will culminate in the ﬁnalisation of the qualitative and quantitative questionnaires, the sample frame, and the determined sample size. Stage 6: Survey operations (Baseline): Upon ﬁnalisation of study design and questionnaires, the ﬁeld team training and induction to the study parameters will be happening on a stage-wise approach. It will involve the enumerator training, and the questionnaires will be pilot tested and subsequent revisions are made during this stage of the activity. The Qualitative data collection exercise will be carried out during which the data management team along with the community engagement team will be available on the ﬁeld to supervise data collection from the target beneﬁciaries. Stage 7: Data analysis and presentation; monitoring dashboard (Baseline) Post the ﬁeld data collection for the baseline a comprehensive process of data cleaning along with data preparation and warehousing would happen. During this phase, a dedicated data analysis team of experts will be involved and coordinating the data handling aspects from the CMS team. Analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team and discussions with the project team will take place. Post the data cleaning activity, data analysis will be front ended by the data analysis team in STATA according to the agreed speciﬁcations and outputs. The qualitative data collected through the FGDs and IDIs would be analysed using qualitative software such as NVivo or Atlas.ti. Draft baseline report will be submitted at the end of this stage. Monitoring dashboard will also be designed for the programme at this stage bringing programme MIS data. Stage 8: Survey operation and data analysis (Periodic Assessments): Starting at month 12, bi-annually; 4 rounds of data collection, once in 6 months as a part of periodic assessment will be undertaken. The periodic assessment will track main variables of interest in terms of outcomes along with delivery outcomes for the programme which will help to understand change, pathways to change. An interim recommendation draft report will be submitted at the end of this stage. Stage 9: Survey operation and data analysis (Endline): Endline tool design and development will be undertaken followed by ﬁeld data collection for the endline and subsequent data analysis. Draft endline report will be submitted at the end of this stage.

NRLP Evaluation ii. Avahan Project: India HIV-AIDS Alliance works on the Bill and Melinda Gates HIV and AIDS prevention programme, Avahana. The focus of the programme is protection and prevention of HIV epidemic among key populations – FSWs, MSMs and TGs. Its interventions in the Telangana and Rayalaseema districts of Andhra Pradesh are implemented through 23 NGO partners. Alliance plans to expand its sexual and reproductive health (SRH) interventions. It will initiate the interventions in three selected sites through action research and subsequently expand it to other sites in their programme area. To help them design the intervention, Alliance has commissioned CMS to identify the sexual and reproductive health needs of the target community and the barriers preventing them in accessing the present SRH services. The study had a coverage of three sites selected for the action research. CMS employed pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaires to collect data from the respondents and conduct FGDs with the help of a pre-tested checklist.

(ii) Improving efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. (iii) Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms. The new approach also necessitates relevant changes in the assurance, MEL and traceability approaches undertaken so that they are able to attest to the quality and volumes of Better Cotton supplied with a higher degree of conﬁdence. To pilot this intervention, the three Producer Units (INTL01, INTL02, and INTL23) located in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of Telangana will be reorganized into a single, larger Producer Unit. This new unit will not only cover the area previously managed by the three units but will also incorporate new villages and farming households (FHH) from both existing and newly added villages. Baseline approach The baseline evaluation of the Producer unit rescoping intervention seeks to validate the problem statements and establish the values of the seven major key performance indicators of the project at the baseline (prior to implementation of the intervention) so that measurement of the same KPIs at the endline (post the intervention) is able to provide sufﬁcient evidence on the successful implementation of the PU rescoping approach along with nuanced insights on scaling up of the initiative. In-depth qualitative interactions with a majority of the stakeholders and quantitative surveys of 120 farmers served as the primary source of data for this study; with secondary data being referred to gather information on a select few indicators. Efforts involved in data collection Interactions with the ﬁeld staff revealed that a considerable amount of their time does go into data collection. Throughout the farming season, a fair amount of information on cotton cultivation is gathered using data collection exercises such as early season estimates, farmer ﬁeld books, post harvest estimates, RIR and soil health is collected from the farmers. Overall, FFs report spending nearly 30 to 45% on such data related work, 20 to 30% on administrative work and 25% to 50% on capacity strengthening of farmers. The PUMs also spend a good portion of their time on verifying the data sent by FFs. They reported that the process of manually collecting information, verifying and uploading the same in soft copies is particularly cumbersome. Even while being inherently motivated to put in a higher number of hours doing ﬁeld work, the ﬁeld staff mentioned that working closely with farmers is what enables them to understand the issues faced by the farmers in adoption of practices in turn contributing towards Better Cotton’s sustainability objectives. Hence, a strong desire to reduce efforts involved in data collection and increase time spent in strengthening the capacity of the farmers was evidenced from the baseline study. Women Participation The focus and reach of Better Cotton programs towards women farmers is on the lower side at present. In a traditional PU catering to around 3000-3500 farmers, ~98% are men, and ~2% to 3% are women. Women are keen to be a part of the Better Cotton program primarily because of beneﬁts such as enhancement in the quality of their crops and being able to ﬁnancially support their 4 --- Page 6 --- households. Interestingly, the uptake of practices (such as intercropping, border cropping, optimizing land use and improving crop diversity) and accrual of beneﬁts was noted to be much higher for women farmers and co-farmers belonging to the INTL01/02 PUs as compared to the relatively newer INTL23. Non-program farmers also expressed their interest in becoming a program farmer and adopting Better Cotton practices, provided the training sessions are held at a time, frequency and duration of their convenience. All the aforementioned remarks point towards the need for a higher extent of capacity strengthening efforts to be directed towards women farmers, especially those from the newer PUs. Effectiveness of the Better Cotton program Inferences from quantitative surveys of the program farmers (mostly male) provides credible evidence towards the quality and efﬁcacy of the training sessions while also indicating farmer preferences for more audio-visual training content and farm exposure visits. Similar to data gathered from the qualitative interactions with women program farmers, the quantitative surveys also revealed that the extent of adoption of Better Cotton practices was higher in members of the older PU (INTL01/02) as compared to the newer one (INTL23). It was also noted that getting to learn new topics (94%), followed by the teaching approach of the facilitator (72%), handholding support provided in adoption of practices (61%) and going on exposure visits (91%) were the major reasons for farmers from the older PU to continue being a part of the program. Higher yield and improved quality of cotton were the main beneﬁts that about 86% and 57% farmers from the older PUs reported from being a part of the Better Cotton program as compared to 50% and 20% farmers from the newer PU. The uptake of practices was lesser in INTL23 mainly due an earlier dissatisfying experience that they had with adoption of sustainable farming practices. Better Cotton harvest Analysis of secondary data available on the cotton area, volumes licensed and harvested denotes an overall increasing trend from 2021 to 2023. Volumes of Better cotton harvested have increased, on average, by 6.65%, 8.15% and 14.58% for INTL01, 02 and 23 respectively from 2021 to 2023. Assurance approach The assurance approach practiced traditionally was described as a comprehensive process. The licensing assessments take place in 3 years for each PU and are aimed at verifying if PUs are in compliance with the Better Cotton standards of cotton production. The third-party veriﬁer mentioned doing a risk proﬁling before the assessment, wherein interviews are conducted with three independent stakeholders not directly associated with the PU. The Better Cotton assurance coordinator expressed a good degree of conﬁdence in the assurance system being used at present. Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning approach The MEL coordinator elaborated on the MEL systems and processes put in place to continuously monitor the different types of data required - mainly reach, farmer lists and RIR. Thorough checking and veriﬁcation of inconsistencies in data takes place at every stage of data collection and reporting. A moderate-to-high degree of conﬁdence was expressed by the coordinator in the MEL approach utilized, while also highlighting a small ﬂaw in sampling of lead farmers as compared to the program farmers. 5 --- Page 7 --- Supply chain credibility Interactions with the supply chain coordinator and the ginner brought out pressing issues affecting Better Cotton uptake and supply chain credibility. It was mentioned that given the low volumes of Better Cotton being procured by the ginners in the region, it is difﬁcult for him to segregate and process it separately as against the processing of conventional cotton. The supply chain coordinator also reiterated the fact that the credibility of the system gets challenged by the potential mixing of Better Cotton and conventional cotton during transportation and processing. To mitigate this, regular visits to ginners are conducted during the active season from September to March to enforce segregation standards. Validation of Problem statements and Recommendations Findings from the baseline bring forth substantial evidence for the issues - such as the amount of efforts spent in data and administration, low participation of women farmers in the Better Cotton initiatives, less volumes of Better Cotton processed in the supply chain, and the associated assurance and MEL systems - that the PU rescoping intervention intends to address. Recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the pilot intervention, from the point of view of the major stakeholders, have been listed below. Recommendations to programme design FFs, PUMs, &amp;amp; PC ● Organize meetings speciﬁcally for women farmers to boost their participation, taking into account the challenges they face, such as domestic duties, travel distances, convenient timings (mostly night) and reasonable duration (45 minutes). ● Expand the scale of demonstrations to include a broader group of farmers so that they are more beneﬁcial and inclusive. ● Incorporate more audiovisual tools into training sessions to improve farmers&amp;#x27; comprehension and retention. ● Simpliﬁcation of data collection and documentation processes so that PUMs can easily input data into the Better Cotton-mandated sheets; thereby bringing in efﬁciency so that the same time could be used for capacity building activities. ● Facilitate provision of irrigation facilities and guidance on irrigation. Male and Female Program farmers, Lead farmers, Non-program and Co-farmers ● Farmers mentioned they would appreciate receiving high-quality seeds or a subsidy for them. ● Program farmers suggested having more season wise trainings, but at a time convenient to them. ● Farmers requested to provide free PPE kits, as the cost of ₹ 1000 per kit is burdensome for them. ● To provide small scale farmers with cotton storage bags, who often struggle to afford these materials. While larger farmers can purchase storage supplies, small farmers would beneﬁt from receiving high-quality storage bags. 6 --- Page 8 --- ● The female program farmers spoke of their preference for separate women-only meetings rather than mixed meetings. They cited uneasiness and uncomfort with male participants who are usually intoxicated by the evening. ● Non program farmers mentioned they would like to attend Better Cotton meetings provided they are held at a convenient time. Third party veriﬁers, Assurance coordinator ● Data shared by Better Cotton staff, before the licensing assessment with the 3PVs, should encompass broader information rather than being limited to the speciﬁc PU. This will help them understand the PUs better and conduct detailed in-depth reviews. MEL coordinator ● Need to exercise caution in sampling of lead farmers. Non-random sampling of lead farmers, unlike Better Cotton farmers, introduces bias in the comparisons between Lead farmers, Better Cotton farmers, and non-Better Cotton farmers. Better Cotton-registere d Ginner ● Aggregation and sale of Better Cotton in large quantities by the farmers might go a long way in ensuring separate processing and higher uptake of Better Cotton in the supply chain. Evaluation team ● Recommend using the RCEEIS (Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efﬁciency, Impact and Sustainability) evaluation criteria at the endline to holistically gauge the attainment of project outcomes and strategies to scale up. 7 --- Page 9 --- 1. Introduction 1.1. Background of the PURE project Better Cotton stands as the globe&amp;#x27;s foremost cotton sustainability initiative. Its mission is to help &amp;#x27;cotton communities survive and thrive, while protecting and restoring the environment’. Better Cotton seeks to transform cotton production worldwide by promoting more sustainable farming practices, improving livelihoods, and ensuring the long-term health of farming communities and the environment. The innovative pilot project called - the &amp;#x27;Producer Unit Rescoping&amp;#x27; (PURE) pilot aims to try out a new, geographic approach to implementing the Better Cotton Standard System to improve efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability of the program by supporting more holistic, community-based approaches - especially around the six principles of Better Cotton, namely, Management, Natural Resources, Crop Protection, Fibre Quality, Decent Work, and Sustainable Livelihoods. Replacing the prevailing method that centers solely on speciﬁed (typically male) farmers on a designated list, PURE broadens its scope to encompass all farming households within a deﬁned geographic unit in the Better Cotton program. The project envisages improving the efﬁciency and scalability of Better Cotton, by reducing data and administration efforts associated with farmer lists or other data related processes, and using alternate methods to monitor implementation (such as periodic baseline studies, GIS and government data, gin procurement volumes, and other secondary sources). The pilot aims to support Better Cotton’s overall goal towards traceability by facilitating stronger farm-to-gin traceability and eliminating the need to segregate cotton from individual farms. 1.2. Objectives of the Program The objectives of the producer unit rescoping pilot are as follows - ● Enhance capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. ● Improve efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. ● Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms. 1.3. Scope of work The scope of the evaluation covers a baseline study (for answering the key evaluation questions, thereby validating the project assumptions and benchmarking the project key performance indicators at the baseline) for the 3 Producer Units to be rescoped, conducted in collaboration with the Better Cotton team and the Programme Partner WWF (Telangana). 8 --- Page 10 --- Figure No. 1 - Location of the 3PUs to be rescoped in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of Telangana 1 . For the pilot project, the 3 producer units of INTL01, INTL02 (both PUs were established in 2012-13 and are considered comparatively mature PUs) and INTL23 (established in 2018-19 and is considered as comparatively newer PU for this study) covering most of Karim Nagar district and some parts of Warangal district in Telangana are being rescoped to form 1 large producer unit. The rescoped producer unit is expected to cater to a larger number of farmers (~10,000 per PU in contrast to ~3000 per PU initially) and cover a larger geographical area (~5000 hectares). 1 Image source - as shared by Better Cotton Team 9 --- Page 11 --- 2. Research Methodology 2.1. Objectives and KPIs of the Evaluation Given the context of the program, the overall objective of the evaluation is to: ● Evaluate the project outcomes (using its key performance indicators 2 ) against its pre-deﬁned objectives* as given below: ○ Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact ■ Time spent on data and administrative tasks by ﬁeld staff vs. time spent on impact driven capacity strengthening. ○ Increased reach with similar project costs: ■ Number of members of farming community trained and/or participating in Better Cotton activities, disaggregated by gender ■ Women having access to activities and beneﬁts within the Better Cotton System through the pilot ■ Women attending scheduled training sessions or workshops ○ Increased scope with similar project costs: ■ Area of cotton cropland covered under one single management system ■ Volume of cotton eligible for Better Cotton licensing covered under one management system ○ Increased Conﬁdence and efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: ■ Robust assurance approach that people have conﬁdence in ■ Relevant MEL data that can be used with other global MEL data, and that provides credible, high- quality data ■ Capacity strengthening approaches that accelerate knowledge, attitude, practice adoption among farming communities ■ Supply chain credibility and trust related to claimed volumes (*The scope of this evaluation is limited to monitoring the values of the indicators for the above objectives at the baseline only.) ● Validate the program statements that the intervention seeks to address; thus verifying the key assumptions on which the program theory of Change rests. 2.2. Research design A meticulous and sequential approach was followed throughout the execution of the assignment - right from reviewing the project documents to tool development, ﬁeld work, analysis and reporting. The approach followed to execute the study is described below - a) Desk Review Review of the Theory of Change and other program documents - The study commenced with a thorough review of the program documents aimed at understanding the traditional system of program implementation as well as the new rescoped approach that is going to be rolled out on a pilot basis. 2 Detailed list of KPIs mentioned in the section on the analytical framework 10 --- Page 12 --- Pre-ﬁeld assessment workshops - Multiple discussions were held with the Better Cotton team and WWF (Telangana) teams to understand the Better Cotton verticals of Assurance, MEL, Capacity Strengthening and Supply Chain, be cognizant of the nuances associated with the work that Better Cotton engages in with the cotton farmers on the ground and get clarity on the objectives of the PU rescoping approach and evaluation. The project KPIs along with their interpretations and implications were understood in depth so that appropriate tools could be designed to measure the KPIs. The list of documents reviewed and names of Better Cotton staff spoken to in order to understand the intervention better are mentioned in the annexure 5.1 and 5.2 respectively. b) Tool design and development Qualitative and quantitative survey and interview tools were developed by the CMS team in thorough consultation with the Better Cotton team before being ﬁnalized and deployed on the ﬁeld. The quantitative survey was digitized on the SurveyCTO platform in English and in Telugu. Qualiﬁed enumerators and moderators were hired to administer the CAPI tool and facilitate the qualitative interactions respectively. Detailed qualitative guides were developed to facilitate semi-structured conversations with stakeholders on most of the project key performance indicators such as on reduction in data and administration efforts, increase in women participation, increase in Better Cotton volumes eligible for licensing, and the supporting activities such as monitoring, evaluation, assurance and supply chain. While the quantitative tool helped get information on the awareness and adoption of better cotton practices followed by the farmers, the qualitative tools captured the perceptions of the stakeholders on the aforementioned KPIs, and the causal relationships underlying their perceptions. Data on the reach of the program, area of production, yield etc was collected from the secondary sources of information readily available with the program team. Links to all the tools developed and used have been provided in annexure 5.3. c) Sampling Quantitative surveys were conducted with the sampled PU farmers as per the sampling strategy described below. Information was captured qualitatively using Focus Group Discussions with the farmers and conducting key informant interviews with staff from the program team, representatives from the community and the ginner. A sample size of 120 3 farmers with a 5% buffer (for the quantitative surveys) was worked out considering a Conﬁdence Level of 90%, Margin of Error of 7.5%, Population Proportion of 50% and Population size of 10,000. Factors of heterogeneity in the population such as type of PU, block, village, land size and irrigation pattern were considered to identify and arrive at the ﬁnal sample using multi-stage and proportional quota sampling techniques. 3 A conﬁdence level of 90% and margin of error of 7.5% was considered to be appropriate for determining the sample size, given that information only on the knowledge, attitude and practices of the farmers was captured from the quantitative tool whereas data on the reach and outcomes of the program was available from secondary data sources. 11 --- Page 13 --- For the quantitative interviews, we spoke to Better Cotton program farmers, belonging to the following blocks and producer units. Post cleaning of the data, the ﬁnal sample used for analysis was of 121 respondents. Block/PU INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 Total Saidapur 8 0 0 8 Chigurumamidi 13 0 0 13 Huzurabad 9 0 0 9 Bheemadevarapally 12 0 0 12 Elkathurthi 0 16 0 16 Ellanthakunta 0 8 0 8 Jammikunta 0 8 0 8 Kamalapur 0 8 0 8 Gangadhara 0 0 16 16 Julapally 0 0 7 7 Karimnagar 0 0 8 8 Ramadugu 0 0 8 8 Total Quantitative Interviews 42 40 39 121 Table No. 1 - Quantitative survey sample For the Qualitative interviews, care was taken to ensure that there is minimal overlap with the villages covered in the quantitative interviews. We also made sure to gather diverse perspectives across the three PUs by speaking to stakeholders from the mature and the relatively newer PUs. The list of stakeholders interviewed for the qualitative study, along with the number of interviews conducted and data collection methods used is given in the table below. Sr. No. Stakeholder Data Collection method No of interviews 1 Program Partner/Project Coordinator KII 1 2 PU Manager KII 3 3 Field facilitator KII 4 4 Program farmers (Male) FGD 4 2 5 Program farmers (Female) FGD 2 6 Non-Program farmers (Female) FGD 2 7 Co-farmers (Female) FGD 2 4 Each FGD constituted of 7-10 participants 12 --- Page 14 --- Sr. No. Stakeholder Data Collection method No of interviews 9 Lead farmer KII 2 10 Ginner KII 1 11 Third-party veriﬁer KII 1 12 Better Cotton staff KII 3 Total Qualitative Interviews 23 Table No. 2 - Qualitative survey sample A complete list of names of the stakeholders interviewed by village, gender and designation is mentioned in annexure 5.4. d) Data Collection and Management For ﬁeld data collection in Telangana, CMS deployed an experienced set of ﬁeld researchers with domain experience within the pool of trained and ethical certiﬁed enumerators from the Community Engagement unit. This team was managed by ﬁeld coordinators and the Field Manager of the South Zone. A total of 6 enumerators (male), 1 supervisor (female) and 2 moderators were employed for this activity. 2 researchers from the CMS research team were also an integral part of the data collection team and were present on the ﬁeld for the entire data collection process, closely engaging in all the qualitative interactions. The ﬁeld teams were trained on the survey and the qualitative tools with the help of translators by the core research team with the assistance from the Field Manager. A training session was conducted at the ﬁeld location and covered the following topics: background of the project, objective of the baseline study, induction to SurveyCTO, protocol to administer the questionnaire, questionnaire ﬂow and data entry dos and don&amp;#x27;ts. After the training, we conducted pilot surveys at a couple of locations with active assistance from the core research team to identify issues if any and incorporate the feedback received to the ﬁnal tool. Utmost care was taken to ensure the presence of researchers sensitized to conducting interviews with female respondents while leading qualitative interactions with either individual or group of female respondents. Both the KIIs and FGDs were conducted at a time and place convenient for the respondents. The WWF team, along with the PUM and FFs assisted CMS in planning the village visits, as they had a better understanding of the proximity between sampled villages and respondent’s time preferences. This enabled CMS to conduct interviews efﬁciently, scheduling them back-to-back and minimizing wastage of time. Throughout the data collection period, the research team coordinated with the ﬁeld team to understand any issues faced in data collection and worked to resolve them shortly after. e) Timeline of Data Collection The baseline data collection started on 10th July 2024 and was completed by 17th July 2024. 13 --- Page 15 --- f) Challenges faced during data collection Despite the support provided by the WWF ﬁeld team in planning the ﬁeldwork and mobilizing the respondents, some challenges were encountered during data collection. These included difﬁculties in ﬁnding women respondents for the quantitative surveys (as per the sampling requirements) and challenges posed due to language constraints. While the local enumerators recruited by CMS were well-versed with the language and communicated smoothly with the respondents, the language constraints were particularly faced by CMS researchers who do not understand the local language. However, the enumerators took care to translate and explain the points being discussed in the interactions to the researchers at the time of the interview. 3. Study Findings 3. 1. Analytical Framework The overall KPIs of the project can broadly be divided into 2 categories. There are 3 overall project KPIs primarily designed to understand if the PU rescoping project was successful in achieving its speciﬁc targets and it can be scaled up without necessarily adding to the project costs. The 3 main KPIs are - 1. KPI 1 - Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact: ● Time spent on data and administrative tasks by ﬁeld staff vs. time spent on impact driven capacity strengthening. 2. KPI 2 - Increased reach with similar project costs: ● Number of members of farming community trained and/or participating in Better Cotton activities, disaggregated by gender ● Women having access to activities and beneﬁts within the Better Cotton System through the pilot ● Women attending scheduled training sessions or workshops 3. KPI 3 - Increased scope with similar project costs: ● Area of cotton cropland covered under one single management system ● Volume of cotton eligible for Better Cotton licensing covered under one management system Along with the main project KPIs, speciﬁc KPIs related to four verticals that Better Cotton works in such as Assurance, MEL, capacity strengthening and supply chain/ﬁrst mile traceability have also been identiﬁed so that changes brought into these components can effectively aid and fulﬁll the requirements of the new PU rescoping approach. 4. Increased conﬁdence and efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: ● KPI 4 - Robust assurance approach that people have conﬁdence in ● KPI 5 - Relevant MEL data that can be used with other global MEL data, and that provides credible, high- quality data ● KPI 6 - Capacity strengthening approaches that accelerate knowledge, attitude, practice adoption among farming communities ● KPI 7 - Supply chain credibility and trust related to claimed volumes 14 --- Page 16 --- The analytical framework utilized in the baseline evaluation of the PU rescoping project tries to establish the baseline measurements (qualitative and quantitative) of all the 7 project KPIs while also trying to validate and substantiate the problem statements outlined in the PU rescoping intervention so that these can be used to compare the values of the KPIs at the endline for effectively determining the achievement of project outcomes. Delineating the underlying assumptions and risks that accompany the execution of the intervention has also been prioritized, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of both the opportunities and challenges associated with implementation of the project. The framework represented below depicts the analytical lens used in the baseline evaluation of the PU rescoping pilot project. The overall project and supporting KPIs have been slightly restructured to appropriately highlight the pathways of change leading to the ﬁnal project objective. Figure No. 2 - Analytical framework for baseline 3.2. Analysis and Inferences Following from the analytical framework, ﬁndings from each of the KPIs have been described in detail in this section 5 . i) KPI 1 - Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact: KPI 1: Time spent on data and administrative tasks by ﬁeld staff vs. time spent on impact driven capacity strengthening. At the endline, this KPI is designed to measure how effectively ﬁeld staff, including Field Facilitators (FFs), Producer Unit Managers (PUMs), and the Project Coordinator, are transitioning from data entry and administrative tasks to more impactful activities, such as capacity strengthening and farmer demonstrations. By reallocating time towards these meaningful interactions that fosters a 5 Based on the framework used, the inferences have been described in the following order - KPI 1, KPI 2, KPI 6, KPI 3, KPI 4, KPI 5 and KPI 7. 15 --- Page 17 --- deeper sense of job satisfaction, it is expected that the ﬁeld team can signiﬁcantly enhance their on-ground work, which is crucial for engaging with more FHHs, particularly women, to join the Better Cotton program. At the baseline, this KPI will benchmark the values of the indicator at the baseline and ﬁnd evidence to establish the assumptions underlying the KPI. 16 --- Page 18 --- Activity Field Facilitators Producer Unit Manager PC INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 Satish Administration 6 30% 20% 30% 10% 10% 5% 7 20% Data 8 40% 30% 40%-45% 60% 9 50% 60% 25-30% Capacity Strengthening 10 30% 50% 25%-30% 30% 40% 35% 45 to 50% Remarks - RIR reporting is time-consuming due to multiple revisions. - More efﬁcient to use a customized data collection device. -Excessive data work causes shoulder and eye pain. -Want to spend more time interacting directly with farmers. -Transferring well monitoring data (on groundwater levels) to Google Sheets is unproductive. - Emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring to ensure that farmers do not revert to old farming practices. - Work on cross-checking and removing duplicates is laborious. - Farmers eager to learn and apply new farming techniques. - Want to spend more time training farmers, but data consolidation work takes time. - Having a dedicated tech-based application for data collection may be useful so FFs can directly feed data into a device. - Complex data work hinders focus on ﬁeld training. - Fieldwork provides better insight into farmers&amp;#x27; issues. - Engaging with farmers is more impactful than data tasks. - Reducing data burden on PUMs and FFs is essential. Table No. 3: Percentage time spent on tasks by ﬁeld staff 10 Capacity strengthening refers to Training &amp;amp; CS activities, demonstrations, community level activities like rallies, AV shows, etc. 9 The PUM of INTL01 informed that 60% of her time goes into data related work like checking and updating farmers list. At the time of interview she was working on updating last years’ farmers list and entering farming data, well monitoring data (on groundwater levels) and compiling/cross-checking soil testing data. She said all these activities take up nearly 60% of her time. 8 Data refers to work on checking/updating data coming in from farmers list, attendance, training and CS activities, adoption Data, RIR &amp;amp; FFB etc 7 The PUM of INTL23 assumed the role of PUM only recently and mentioned that she is taking help from the PUM of INTL01 for most of the administration related work at present. Hence her time allocation for the said work is less. It should increase in the following months once she understands her role more clearly and is ready to assume more responsibility. 6 Administration includes work related to Human Resources, Finance, Accounts and Project Management. 17 --- Page 19 --- Field Facilitators (FFs) Field Facilitators are the direct link between the farmers and the ofﬁce staff. They are responsible for collecting some of the most crucial data mandated by Better Cotton. FFs are highly motivated and dedicated to their work and take personal interest in ensuring the welfare of the villages and farmers under their purview. I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” - Field Facilitator of Allanthakunta (INTL02) FFs are broadly responsible for on-ﬁeld data collection, risk monitoring, for educating the farmers on the 6 Better Cotton principles and for helping them bring those into practice. Although both tasks are ongoing throughout the year, the workload for data collection and veriﬁcation intensiﬁes during the season, particularly when deadlines for speciﬁc Better Cotton-mandated data sheets approach. It is during such times that the FFs ﬁnd it difﬁcult to balance their data work and CS activities. As understood from ﬁeld interactions, the broad responsibilities of an FF are ● Help farmers ﬁll Farmer Field Books - FFs ensure that farmers are listing the correct information. Sometimes if FFs are unable to help the farmers, their fellow farmers or children help them. ● Collect data from farmers on various aspects mandated by Better Cotton - FFs are entrusted with doing the ground level data collection for lists such as the farmers list, adoption data and RIR. Although FFs do not directly input data into the RIR, WWF has provided them with simpliﬁed data collection sheets. These sheets make it easier for FFs to gather accurate information, which is then reviewed by the PUM and digitized for ofﬁcial use. Apart from the above mentioned lists, the FFs are also maintaining an LG attendance book. Farmers are mandated to sign the attendance book after every meeting. ● Capacity strengthening of Farmers - FFs, on an everyday basis, conduct CS training to educate the farmers on an array of topics like water management, biodiversity, soil health management, storage of cotton, ways to increase fertility of land, reduction in water pollution, etc. Nearly 20 to 30 farmers typically attend these training sessions. For those who are unable to participate, the FFs make personal visits to their homes or farms to ensure they are informed about the topics covered. Additionally, FFs follow up with these farmers by phone, encouraging them to attend the next training session. For these trainings, FFs carry communication material like ﬂexes, pamphlets, stickers, etc. Out of all the material aid, FFs believe that displaying ﬂexes is very impactful and helpful for the farmers to understand concepts easily. ● Community level activities like Rallies, AV shows, demos etc.- In addition to the CS training, FFs also arrange rallies, demonstrations, and AV shows for the farmers to help them understand the Better Cotton principles better. During the ﬁeld visits, it was found that these 18 --- Page 20 --- activities have a huge spillover effect on non program farmers as they tend to see or listen to the topics covered in these sessions. ● Monthly Action Plan (internal requirement by WWF, Telangana) - The FFs drafts and submits the monthly action plan on the 28th of every month to the respective PUM which consists of the challenges, suggestions, requirements and other feedback from the farmers on ﬁeld. The Action Plan is reviewed by the PUMs and APUMs to strategize the activities to be conducted in the respective PUs. The document also serves the purpose of ensuring a detailed brainstorming on the respective PUs with the on-ground experiences and perspectives of the FFs. Overall, FFs report spending nearly 30 to 45% on data related work, 20 to 30% on admin work and 25% to 50% on capacity strengthening of farmers. Time distribution of Work: FFs spend a signiﬁcant amount of time on data-related tasks, such as data entry and updating farmer lists. These tasks consume nearly 30 to 40% of their overall work time. They further lament that such extensive focus on data work often leads to physical discomfort, including shoulder and eye strain, and detracts the FFs from their ability to engage directly with farmers—a task they ﬁnd far more rewarding and impactful. I want to spend more time on training because excessive data work gives me shoulder and eye pain. I ﬁnd interacting with farmers more fruitful. Given an option I would like to reduce my data entry work” - Field Facilitator of INTL23 The FFs expressed a strong preference for reducing their data entry workload to allocate more time to capacity-strengthening activities, such as training farmers on sustainable agricultural practices. Besides aligning to their personal interests, FFs believe that these interactions provide immediate beneﬁts to farmers. For instance, the ﬁeld facilitator of INTL02 mentioned that he ﬁnds transferring well monitoring data from the ﬁeld to Google Sheets unnecessary. He suggested that this time could be better spent training farmers who cultivate crops like maize, paddy, and others along with cotton. Additionally, he also mentioned that the Farmers List collection and updation is a time consuming process which takes up almost 15 days annually to cover all the villages under him. FFs recognize the importance of data in monitoring and supporting their efforts, understanding that it plays a crucial role in assessing the local situation and tailoring their training sessions accordingly. Despite understanding this, FFs are eager to shift the balance, by spending less time on data tasks and more on direct, impactful engagement with the farming communities. Challenges faced by FFs: FFs encounter challenges with incorrect data and delays in data sharing, often requiring time-consuming follow-ups. These inaccuracies can compromise the quality of related data sheets, making the process particularly difﬁcult for the FFs to manage effectively. Suggestions by FF for Better Cotton: FF shared that they rely heavily on their mobile phone for nearly every task, including taking photos and sending them to the PUM daily. This constant use generates a large amount of data, which often causes their phone to lag or freeze. They suggested 19 --- Page 21 --- that it would be beneﬁcial if Better Cotton could provide them with tablets to better manage these tasks. Additionally, to boost female participation, FF thinks it is crucial to organize additional, separate meetings speciﬁcally for women farmers, addressing the challenges they encounter, such as domestic responsibilities and long travel distances. Moreover, incorporating more audiovisual tools into training sessions can signiﬁcantly improve farmers&amp;#x27; understanding and retention of the material. Producer Unit Managers (PUM) Each PU is assigned a manager (PUM) who is responsible for overseeing work done by the FFs and by virtue the farmers within their unit. Every PUM has an assistant PUM (APUM) who helps the former in ﬁeld visits, training, documentation, veriﬁcation and monitoring. The PUMs are primarily tasked with managing and compiling all the data that needs to be submitted to Better Cotton. In addition to their data responsibilities, PUMs also educate FFs on various topics to be taught to farmers, tailoring the content to the local context. PUMs daily spend half an hour to one hour with the FFs to understand the challenges they are facing (if any), their learnings, etc. PUMs regularly visit the ﬁelds to ensure that training sessions are conducted according to the prescribed format. They also address farmer queries and, when necessary, visit their farms. PUMs handle multiple lists at a time and have to strictly adhere to the timelines speciﬁed by Better Cotton. At any given point in the year, PUMs are working on some data. As the deadline for any data list approaches, the PUMs often ﬁnd themselves dedicating the majority of their time to completing it, sometimes at the expense of conducting farmer training sessions. PUMs mentioned that compiling all the data received (from the FFs), followed by cross checking and correcting duplicated data, is a laborious and complex task and has a direct effect on their ability to concentrate on farmer training. In a year, PUMs are mandated to conduct 6 farmer trainings per LG and conduct around 3 to 4 special activities like AVs, demos, etc. PUMs conduct training sessions as the farmers are curious to know about new methods (like PB Knot, Cremigel etc.) and implement it in their ﬁeld. When asked about the most impactful aspect of their work, PUMs highlighted their preference for training both farmers and FFs. They emphasized that FFs serve as a critical link between the farmers and the ofﬁce team, making their education essential for the overall success of the program. Apart from training the FFs and farmers, PUMs also provide special training to anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare workers, pesticides sprayers, school children etc on the relevant principles of Better Cotton. Apart from the data work and farmer and FF training, PUMs also do some level of administrative work like recruiting FFs. Overall, PUMs allocate 5% to 10% of their time to administrative tasks and 30% to 35% to capacity strengthening activities. However, the majority of their time, around 50%-60%, is consumed by data-related work. While FFs collect data from the ﬁeld, it is the responsibility of the PUMs to oversee the data collection process and check the validity of the reported data. At least 20% of the collected data is veriﬁed by the PUMs. While they recognize the importance of maintaining accurate data records as proof that farmers are adhering to program objectives, they expressed a preference for spending more time in the ﬁeld. They believe that reducing data entry tasks would not only increase their satisfaction and happiness but also enhance their ability to understand and address the challenges faced by farmers. 20 --- Page 22 --- At the PU level, no distinction was observed between the work done by the FFs and PUMs in the 3 PUs. Program staff in all locations were equally motivated and actively engaged in educating farmers and raising awareness about new and sustainable farming practices. Project Coordinator During our ﬁeld visit, we spoke to Satish Botla, a consultant for WWF India and the Project Coordinator for Better Cotton in the Karimnagar cluster. He handles a diverse set of responsibilities including both administrative and technical domains. On the administrative side, the project coordinator is involved in the collection and organization of data for project proposals and the submission of annual reports to Better Cotton. He regularly conducts ﬁeld visits, typically two to three times a week, to monitor project activities, review progress, and ensure compliance with project goals. His administrative duties also include staff recruitment and supervision, as well as conducting internal reviews where he discusses ﬁeld observations with PUMs. Additionally, he is responsible for cross-checking documents (like adoption data and RIR) to ensure their accuracy and completeness before they are submitted to Better Cotton or other stakeholders. He also oversees capacity-building efforts, planning and organizing training sessions for staff to enhance their skills and effectiveness. On the technical side, the project coordinator plays a key role in planning and conducting Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions for PUMs and FFs, ensuring they are well-equipped to educate farmers. He does not deliver any direct training to the farmers. He is responsible for developing training materials, including translating Better Cotton principles and other project-related content into the local language to make them more accessible. Satish also plans and implements training programs for PUMs and FFs, ensuring that the content is contextually relevant. His technical responsibilities extend to supporting Better Cotton licensing assessments, where he ensures that WWF’s implementation aligns with Better Cotton standards. He also develops and oversees corrective action plans as needed, reviews project activities, analyzes results, and establishes detailed monitoring protocols for various aspects of the project, such as FFBs and RIR. In his role, the project coordinator allocates approximately 20% of his time to administrative tasks. Data management, which includes overseeing the Farmers List, Attendance, Adoption, RIR, and FFBs, takes up 25-30% of his time. Training and capacity strengthening also consume 35% to 40% of his time, while demonstrations and community-level activities account for 5% - 10%. Greater emphasis should be placed on capacity building. We have an overwhelming amount of documentation in Better Cotton, with soft copies alone ﬁlling up 1 TB of storage. For years, I have consistently provided feedback, in the self-assessment reports, that the data burden on PUMs needs to be reduced, allowing them to focus more on ﬁeldwork.&amp;quot; - Project Coordinator, WWF (Telangana) Despite a signiﬁcant portion of his work being dedicated to data and capacity strengthening, the project coordinator believes that direct engagement with ﬁeldwork and capacity building is more beneﬁcial for farmers than data management . He has previously discussed with Better Cotton the 21 --- Page 23 --- excessive level of data collection required, noting that the data burden has decreased signiﬁcantly compared to previous years. Now, only 15% of farmers in a PU are required to maintain FFBs, with the rest participating voluntarily. Overall, his preference is to devote more time to training and ﬁeldwork rather than being overwhelmed by data tasks. There is a strong desire among FFs, PUM, and the Project Coordinator to allocate more time to impactful work, such as capacity building, rather than spending the majority of their time on data entry and administrative tasks. By focusing more on these meaningful activities, the FFs and PUMs can engage more closely with farmers, which will not only deepen the existing relationships but also attract greater interest from non-program farmers, encouraging them, especially women, to join the Better Cotton program. ii) KPI 2 - Increased reach with similar project costs: KPI 2 : a) Number of members of farming community trained and/or participating in Better Cotton activities, disaggregated by gender b) Women having access to activities and beneﬁts within the Better Cotton System through the pilot c) Women attending scheduled training sessions or workshops A snapshot of the perspectives of women program, non-program and co-farmers is given in the table below - 22 --- Page 24 --- PU Program farmers Co-farmers Non-program farmers Older PU (INTL01/ 02) - The most enjoyable part of the Better Cotton training is learning about the effects of harmful pesticides and opting for organic fertilizers and intercropping instead and also the exposure visits. - Agency of women to attend meetings and venture out of the house enhanced post joining the Better Cotton program, - Women use organic fertilizers, pheromone traps, neem oil. - Co-farmers enjoy one to one farmer training &amp;amp; ﬁeld visits over watching videos as it is more interactive in nature. - No discrimination with respect to the accessibility of training programmes was reported between program farmers and co-farmers. - Women learned the importance of wearing gloves, have switched from using urea to compost and neem oil after joining the Better Cotton program. - They have not been using cocktail chemicals since the last 3-4 years. - Farmers report lower input costs due to organic fertilizers, encouraged by FFs. - Since joining the Better Cotton program, women feel empowered with knowledge and ﬁnancial independence. - Children do not help on the farms as they prioritize their education and jobs. - Most women have not attended any Better Cotton trainings in the past - They use cocktails and other chemicals like Urea and DAP - Women eager to join the Better Cotton program to learn new techniques for improving their cotton crop quality but mentioned that the training has to be held at times convenient to them. - Women are not aware of pesticide costs, most of the farm work handled by their male counterparts Newer PU (INTL23) - Women claim not learning anything new from the Better Cotton training; the lengthy meetings are challenging for them due to household and agricultural responsibilities 11 . They suggest limiting the meetings to 30 minutes. - Women report the Better Cotton program - Co-farmers initially believed cotton couldn&amp;#x27;t thrive without pesticides, but since joining Better Cotton, they have switched from DAP urea to organic fertilizers, which has lead to increase in their yield - Farmers found the Better Cotton training useful as it helped them understand the importance of organic fertilizers &amp;amp; of PPE kits. - 2 of 8 farmers mention having attended a Better Cotton training, ﬁve to six times - Women eager to join the Better Cotton program to learn new techniques for improving their cotton crop quality but require the training to be held at times convenient to them. - Women expressed preference for separate 11 It was noted from the ﬁeld observations that women of INTL23 were inherently less motivated as compared to the other PUs. A prior disappointing experience in using organic methods may have caused their current disinterest, which is being reﬂected here. With respect to the ﬁeld trainings, the FFs of both the old and new PU seem equally motivated and eager to educate the farmers. 23 --- Page 25 --- PU Program farmers Co-farmers Non-program farmers not having any impact on their agency till now. - Women averse to using organic fertilizers due to bad past experiences where they got no results from using neem oil. - Despite attending meetings, 70% of co-farmers do not follow the recommended practices on the usage of pesticides due to reluctance in changing traditional approaches or other livelihood priorities. - Farmers ﬁnd farm exposure visits to be particularly useful. However, participation in rallies has been low, especially of women, due to household chores - Women engage in mutual discussions with their husbands regarding farming decisions, and they feel empowered to suggest changes, although not all suggestions are accepted. - Children help on farms occasionally when not at their schools. women-only meetings - Female farmers were not aware of pheromone traps - Women said that decisions, both of ﬁeld and household, are largely taken by their male counterparts Table No. 4 : PU-wise perspectives of women farmers (Program, Co-farmers and Non-Program) Socioeconomic and farm-level outcomes are much better from women program farmers from the older PUs as compared to program farmers from the newer PU; thus providing evidence for investment of higher capacity strengthening efforts of the ﬁeld staff towards working closely with farmers from the newer PU, giving handholding support so that knowledge and adoption of Better Cotton practices increases among this cohort of farmers and they are able to reap the beneﬁts from the same. 24 --- Page 26 --- Program farmers (female) Program farmers have been cultivating cotton for the past two decades, along with maize. FFs from both the established INTL01/02 and the newer INTL23 provide training on a wide range of topics. These include the use of biopesticides, proper handling and application of PPE kits, and the beneﬁts of using cow urine, cow dung, and neem oil. They also cover essential practices such as proper hand washing, precautions for pregnant women, addressing women’s health issues, preventing child labor, and techniques like intercropping and border cropping. All the women reported following the above practices diligently. Elaborating on the program’s reach towards women program farmers, it is important to note that women&amp;#x27;s participation as program farmers in the Better Cotton program is extremely low at present. Although a typical PU includes around 3000-3500 farmers, ~98% are men, with women making up only about ~2%-3% of the cohort. Field observations too pointed towards the fact that women participation was less and most of them were always occupied with domestic work such as cooking, cleaning or taking care of children. Interviews revealed that women struggle to balance household chores with farming responsibilities, with them naturally opting for the former. Of the 3529, 3524 and 3018 total farmers listed in each of the PUs INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23, the number of women farmers are 42, 7 and 81 respectively. These are graphically represented in the ﬁgure shown below - Figure No. 3: Percentage female program farmers in each PU The primary motivation for women to join the Better Cotton program was to enhance the quality of their crops and ﬁnancially support their households, alleviating the ﬁnancial burden on their husbands. Women receive full support from their family to do farming and in fact even take some farm decisions. It was observed that women of both the PUs (old and new) like attending training as the sessions are engaging. Women reported that they follow all the practices that are taught to them. Intercropping and border cropping is done by women of both of the PUs as well. 25 --- Page 27 --- When asked about the facilities provided during Better Cotton training, the women mentioned that they were provided with chairs, water, and access to toilets. Both husbands and wives could speak freely in the meetings, with FFs treating everyone equally and promptly addressing any questions. In one of the two program farmers&amp;#x27; FGDs conducted, the women from the older INTL02 group shared that they pass on the knowledge gained to other non-program farmers, which has helped them understand the importance of using organic pesticides. In the newer INTL23, women mentioned that they do not share or discuss any information learnt in the training with other non program farmers. They mentioned that when they try to share their knowledge with their husbands, they are often dismissed with the remark that the husbands already know. It is important to note that there was no difference observed in the capacity strengthening approach of INTL23 vis-a-vis the other PUs. Women of INTL23 seemed less motivated and not inclined to adopt sustainable farming practices due to a prior disappointing experience that they had with adoption of organic practices. Figure No. 4 - FGD with women program farmers, Bheempelli, INTL02 Farmers expressed a strong preference for their children not to pursue agriculture, citing its demanding and labor-intensive nature. However, there was a clear difference between the old and new PUs in terms of personal motivation to try out sustainable practices, soil testing, number of training/demonstrations conducted, effect of the program on women empowerment, and learnings from training. From the arguments listed below, it can be concluded that women from the newer PU, INTL23 require more training and handholding support for them to absorb the knowledge shared and implement those practices in their farms thus indicating the fact that the ﬁeld staff’s efforts towards capacity strengthening (especially of farmers newly joining the program) are necessary and required. ● In INTL02, women have shifted away from chemical pesticides, opting instead for neem oil, vermicompost, and avoiding the use of chemical cocktails . They are conscious of the detrimental effects chemicals have on both soil health and their own well-being. Previously, 26 --- Page 28 --- when they relied on chemicals like urea, DAP, and cocktails, their crops suffered damage. However, since joining the Better Cotton program, they have transitioned to organic fertilizers, leading to reduced input costs, increased yields, and consequently higher incomes. ● Conversely, while farmers in INTL23 also use organic fertilizers such as neem oil, navdhanya, and biopesticides, they continue to rely on chemicals like urea and potassium, including cocktails. Their past experiences with organic methods have been less favorable, resulting in low trust in these practices. For instance, women reported trying neem oil for pest control but did not achieve the desired results. ● Farmers of INTL02 reported that soil tests were done free of cost for them and the results, which came after 15 days, helped them decide which crops to grow. Conversely, farmers of INTL23 reported that no soil testing was done and they felt clueless about what to grow and which fertilizers to use. ● In both PUs, training sessions have been conducted on schedule, with women actively participating. In INTL23, three training sessions for women and two seasonal training sessions for men have been held as of July 2024, while in INTL02, 3 to 5 training sessions have taken place. However, in INTL23, no demonstrations or rallies have been organized for women, whereas men have attended demonstrations on intercropping, the use of navdhanya, and other practices. This may be because the women of INTL23 are only available in the evenings or at night when their household chores are done. In fact, they have suggested scheduling training during these times to better accommodate their availability. ● Women of INTL02 reported that after being part of the Better Cotton program, husbands have been more open about women attending training sessions or venturing outside the house whereas in INTL23 women saw no such differences in agency. ● When program farmers were asked to rate the extent to which the training sessions contributed to their knowledge and awareness, farmers from INTL02 12 rated it as ‘Medium.’ They mentioned that they enjoy attending the trainings and appreciate the interactive format, which keeps them engaged. In contrast, farmers from INTL23 rated the impact as ‘Low,’ expressing that the sessions do not offer any new or signiﬁcant information. They also found the meetings to be lengthy and time-consuming, making it difﬁcult for them to stay for the entire duration due to their responsibilities at home and in the ﬁelds. They suggested shortening the meetings to around 30 minutes. Changes in Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) Related to Cotton Farming Farmers involved in the Better Cotton program have experienced changes in their knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to cotton farming. Women farmers of INTL02, have greatly reduced their use of heavy chemicals, recognizing the associated health risks. This awareness has led to an increase in both yield and crop quality, with market rates for their produce rising dramatically from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,800 per quintal before the program to Rs. 7,500 per quintal after joining. Women farmers of INTL23, too, use only ‘green color 13 ’ marked pesticides. The adoption of intercropping and border cropping, such as planting yellow gram, has become common practice among farmers, optimizing land use and improving crop diversity. Additionally, 13 Pesticides are classiﬁed by toxicity level using a color code, Red: Extremely toxic, Yellow: Highly toxic, Blue: Moderately toxic, Green: Less toxic. 12 Farmers were chosen either from INTL01 or 02 for this KPI. Program female farmers from Bheempelli village of INTL02 were randomly selected for this discussion. Respondents from INTL01 were not a part of this sample. 27 --- Page 29 --- they have started growing two crops annually—cotton and vegetables—allowing them to supplement their household diet and reduce expenses. A notable shift has been the increased adoption of PPE kits, reﬂecting a growing emphasis on health and safety, in both the PUs. This improved awareness both in terms of occupational safety and health (OSH) along with an increased yield as a result of adopting the program promoted approaches, have contributed to higher ﬁnancial returns for the farmers leading to an enhancement in their standard of living. Many women reported that they have been able to purchase items like TVs, refrigerators, bikes, and even tractors. However, this improvement in lifestyle was reported only by the INTL02 women farmers. Figure No. 5 - FGD with women program farmers, Bheempelli, INTL02 Women farmers of INTL02 are now making a proﬁt of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 30,000 per acre per season, with overall expenditures decreasing. Over the past ﬁve years, they have transitioned from using harmful pesticides like urea, DAP, and chemical cocktails to organic fertilizers, which has increased their income while reducing fertilizer costs. This comprehensive shift in farming practices demonstrates the impact of the Better Cotton program on their lives. Non-program farmers (female) Out of the two non program farmers FGD that were conducted - women from INTL01 mentioned that they have not attended any Better Cotton training in the past. While on the other hand two out of eight women of INTL23 mentioned that they have attended ﬁve to six Better Cotton trainings in the past. Women who could not attend cited reasons like either tending to household chores or training timings clashing with farm timings. Women farmers of both the PUs unanimously agreed that they would like to participate in the Better Cotton program provided the trainings are held at a convenient time. Currently the trainings are not held at a time when they are available and therefore they are not able to attend or show any interest. In addition, the women spoke of their preference for separate women-only meetings rather than mixed meetings. They cited uneasiness and uncomfort with male participants who are usually intoxicated by the evening. 28 --- Page 30 --- Women from both PUs (old and new) were aware of important practices, such as avoiding child labor, using PPE kits, adopting organic methods like applying sheep and cow dung, practicing intercropping and border cropping, and avoiding the use of &amp;#x27;red color&amp;#x27; coded (i.e. harmful) pesticides. However, they were unaware of pheromone traps and relied heavily on chemicals for their farms. When asked what they would like to learn from the Better Cotton program, they said that they are keen to learn new methods of growing cotton to get a good quality crop. However, clear differences between program and non-program farmers were evident. Non-program farmers admitted to using chemicals like urea, DAP, potassium, and chemical cocktails, while program farmers demonstrated awareness of the environmental harm caused by such pesticides. Additionally, non-program farmers were less familiar with practices like using pheromone traps. A signiﬁcant difference observed from a gender perspective was that non-program women farmers were less informed about farm activities, including the costs of pesticides, and indicated that decision-making was primarily handled by their husbands. In contrast, women who participated in the program demonstrated greater independence, actively participating in decision-making and being more involved in farm management. Overall, non-program women farmers explicitly expressed interest in being a part of the program, however with the condition that the meetings take place at a convenient time. Co-farmers (female) Farmers who are a part of the household of the program farmer (listed in the Better Cotton program) are called Co-farmers. At present, there are about 1691, 2327 and 3075 co-farmers from INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23 who have beneﬁted from the Better Cotton training program. Of these, about 1501, 2033, and 1975 co-farmers from each of the PUs are female. The percentage of female co-farmers reached by the Better Cotton program at present is shown in the graph below - Figure No. 6: Percentage female co-farmers in each PU 29 --- Page 31 --- Co-farmers of INTL02 reported that they enjoy attending the training sessions as it adds to their knowledge plus they get to interact with other farmers. A group of co-farmers informed that till date, they have learnt about safety and precautionary measures like using gloves, mask and as well as inter cropping and border cropping in the training. The co-farmers reported that they did not ﬁnd any difference in the way the FFs engaged with the program farmers and them in the training and also mentioned that the FFs are very proactive in addressing their queries. They informed that farmers are provided with chairs, and water during the training. Typically, both husband and wife attend the meetings, with time and travel distance being the key factors inﬂuencing their decision to attend the training. Co-farmers reported that whatever they learn in the meetings are shared with other non-program farmers 14 . The co farmers of INTL02 also reported that they enjoy ﬁeld visits more than audio visual shows, as the former is more interactive in nature. Figure No. 7 - FGD with Co-farmers, Sambyapalli, INTL23 The effectiveness of the training is evident in several key changes reported by the women: ● Before participating in the Better Cotton program, they were unaware of the importance of wearing gloves, a practice they have since adopted. ● The program also shifted their approach to farming, moving them away from using chemicals like urea to more sustainable alternatives such as compost and neem oil. They noted that they have not used chemical cocktails for the past 3-4 years, reﬂecting the long-term impact of the training . ● Additionally, the farmers have experienced a decrease in ﬁeld investment costs. They attribute these savings to the use of organic fertilizers, a practice strongly encouraged by the FFs, which has led to lower overall expenses compared to their practices before joining the Better Cotton program. 14 It was observed that generally women are the only ones who tend to share info with their male counterparts or other female farmers. In some PUs we saw the active participation of both male and females (especially in Bheempelli) - there was interaction between the two and they took decisions together. 30 --- Page 32 --- Over the past few years, there has been a noticeable increase in women’s participation in meetings. Previously, their husbands were reluctant to listen to their input, but the training has given these women a stronger voice and inﬂuence in decision-making. As their knowledge has grown, so has their authority and conﬁdence in expressing their opinions. This was reported by the farmers of both the PUs. Co-farmers of INTL02 reported gaining greater ﬁnancial independence; they now earn their own money and do not have to depend on their husbands for monetary assistance. This newfound autonomy has resulted from an increased participation of the women in various programs organized by Better Cotton, in self-help groups and focused attempts by the FF’s in engaging speciﬁcally with the Co-farmers towards enhancing their knowledge along with their socio-economic empowerment, has contributed to an overall sense of empowerment among the women. They particularly appreciated learning about intercropping and organic fertilizers, further reinforcing their active role in farming and decision-making. Co-farmers of INTL23 mentioned that they take help of children in the ﬁeld during holidays for simple ﬁeld tasks (not any hazardous activity) and that they ensure that it does not hinder their education. Thus, program farmers have found the Better Cotton training sessions highly impactful, actively applying what they learn to enhance their farming practices, with women particularly valuing the interactive and engaging nature of these sessions. Meanwhile, non-program farmers and co-farmers have shown a strong desire to join the Better Cotton program, eager to learn new methods for improving their crop quality. Many non-program farmers expressed that they would participate in the Better Cotton training sessions if they were held at more convenient times, highlighting their enthusiasm to gain new knowledge and practices. Co-farmers have also reported that they enjoy attending these sessions, appreciating both the knowledge gained and the opportunity to interact with other farmers. iii) KPI 6 - Increased efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: Capacity strengthening approaches KPI 6: Capacity Strengthening - Increase in number of farmers reached through Capacity Strengthening in PURE (as compared to PU); that accelerates knowledge, attitude and practices adoption in them. An overview of the perspectives of program farmers (male) from different producer units is listed in the table below - PU Older PU (INTL01/02) New PU (INTL23) Program farmers (male) - Beneﬁtted due to reduction in expenses and improvement in yield post making use of organic fertilizers as opposed to using chemical fertilizers previously. - FFBs maintained diligently by the farmers - FFB not maintained/updated by the farmers regularly - Reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals and increased adoption of safer practices like using green color pesticides instead of red . 31 --- Page 33 --- PU Older PU (INTL01/02) New PU (INTL23) - Mention audio visuals being the best medium for learning new concepts. - Farmers joining the Better Cotton program later were inspired by the progress of Better Cotton farmers using fewer pesticides and participating in rallies and AVs. - Quality of life of program farmers enhanced post joining the Better Cotton program. Farmers informed that they could purchase chairs for their home, educate their children and some could also convert their kutcha houses (non-durable) to pucca houses (strong and durable). - Female farmers rarely attend meetings due to household chores &amp;amp; decision making authority is majorly the male. - However, Better Cotton training has helped female farmers in gaining knowledge and hence, better decision making roles now. - Duration of meetings to be reduced to 45 minutes. - Farmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training tools and better safety materials. Table No. 5 : PU-wise perspectives of program farmers (Male) Program farmers (Male) Male farmers constitute the majority of the program farmers listed with the Better Cotton program at present. As shown below, of the total number of farmers about 98.81% from INTL01 (3497 farmers), 99.80% from INTL02 (3517 farmers) and 97.32% from INTL23 (2937 farmers) are male. Figure No. 8: Percentage male program farmers in each PU Effectiveness of trainings (male program farmers) Quantitative surveys conducted of 120 farmers from the 3 PUs helped showcase the effectiveness of training sessions and the subsequent change in knowledge, attitude and practices of the farmers. While farmers from the older PUs (INTL01 and INTL02) mentioned that they had attended 5 trainings on average in the last 1 year, farmers from the newer PU (INTL23) informed that they had attended 3 such trainings in the last season. When the sampled 42, 40 and 39 farmers from INTL01, 32 --- Page 34 --- 02 and 23 were enquired about the concepts that they learned in the training sessions, the majority indicated that they had learned about crop rotation, application of organic manures, conducting soil tests and installing traps in the trainings . Having been a part of the Better Cotton program for a longer duration, a higher percentage of farmers from the older producer units (INTL01 and 02) mentioned learning about more topics concerning sustainable cotton production as compared to farmers from the new PU (INTL23). The extent of adoption of practices is also relatively higher in the older PUs as compared to the new PU. This data corroborates the fact that a higher amount of effort is required in educating farmers newly inducted into the program so as to bring about a change in their levels of awareness, knowledge and adoption of practices as compared to the farmers who have been a part of the program since long. The percentage of farmers (from the sample surveyed and from secondary data on the population) reporting knowledge of key concepts and adoption of cotton farming practices respectively is mentioned in the table below - 33 --- Page 35 --- Concepts learned and practices adopted by PU INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 Sample (42) Population (1696) Sample (40) Population (1947) Sample (39) Population (1606) Crop Rotation 64.29% 68.75% 90.00% 61.33% 74.36% 56.16% Deep plowing once in 2-3 years 30.95% 63.74% 65.00% 62.56% 30.77% 69.49% Application of organic manures 83.33% 47.58% 92.50% 60.35% 71.79% 45.77% Trichoderma soil drenching 7.14% NA 10.00% NA 5.13% NA Refuge crops 28.57% 73.00% 40.00% 58.14% 15.38% 38.73% Border and trap crops 42.86% 52.77% 55.00% 54.60% 48.72% 41.16% Quality seed selection 45.24% 100% 45.00% 100.00% 28.21% 100.00% Foliar application of micronutrients 30.95% NA 50.00% NA 5.13% NA Inter crop with pulses 40.48% 31.31% 47.50% 38.11% 35.90% 31.57% Plough across the slope 40.48% 63.09% 30.00% 48.95% 17.95% 60.65% Soil test based fertilizers and nutrient application 57.14% 50.65% 65.00% 50.08% 53.85% 43.15% Top dressing of complex fertilizers 45.24% 58.02% 30.00% 45.61% 25.64% 43.40% Botanical leaf extractions 26.19% 30.84% 20.00% 49.05% 28.21% 38.23% Installation of traps 64.29% 30.48% 80.00% 40.63% 61.54% 32.69% Table No 6: Knowledge of practices (in sample) and adoption of practices (by population in 2022-23) by PU 15 15 Differences in knowledge and adoption rates of Better Cotton practices could also be attributed to chance and/or unintentional biases in sampling/ other data collection processes. 34 --- Page 36 --- Even while farmers across the 3 PUs indicate a similar trend in knowledge (from sample) and adoption (from population) rates for most sustainable cotton farming practices, showcasing that knowledge of practices does eventually translate into adoption, for some indicators like application of organic manures, installation of traps and crop rotation - the extent of adoption of practices seems to be lesser even though the knowledge of practices is there (indicating the necessity of sufﬁcient time required for behavioral change). However for some indicators, such as growing refuge crops, selecting quality seeds and plowing across the slope - the reported adoption of practices is higher than their knowledge. These anomalies could be due to chance or also due to unintended biases in sampling or interpretation of questions by the data collector/respondent. The farmers also revealed learning about topics such as proper fertilizer usage, the importance of wearing PPE kits, and avoiding harmful pesticides in the training sessions. Farmers from INTL01 unanimously agreed that videos are the most effective medium for learning new farming techniques and concepts. They also appreciated the fact that the training sessions are held at convenient locations and times. Farmers of INTL01 do not practice child labour as they want their children to focus on education. In contrast to the positive attitudes and practices of farmers from the older PU, farmers from INTL23 reported that they do not wear PPE kits regularly leading to health issues. Program farmers in INTL23 further stated that they are the primary decision-makers and consider the input of only those women they believe to be knowledgeable. They also acknowledged that the Better Cotton program has empowered female farmers, enhancing their knowledge and thereby increasing their inﬂuence in decision-making processes. Farmers who joined the Better Cotton program later shared that their decision was inﬂuenced by observing the progress of existing Better Cotton farmers, particularly in reducing pesticide use, as well as by the impactful rallies and videos. As a result, both co-farmers and other non-program farmers have become increasingly interested in joining the Better Cotton program. When asked why some non-program farmers remain uninterested, the farmers explained that they tend to have a rigid mindset and are generally resistant to joining any programs. More than 70% of the farmers surveyed from all the 3 PUs mentioned that they were happy with the quality of the training sessions. When asked about the aspects of the training that they like the most, farmers from the older PUs told of getting to learn new topics (94%), followed by the teaching approach of the facilitator (72%), handholding support provided in adoption of practices (61%) and going on exposure visits (91%). Responses of farmers from the new PU (INTL23) are about 10% points lower than the older PU farmers when enquired on the same aspects of training that they like. More than 70% farmers from all 3 PUs indicated that there are no such aspects of the training program that they dislike, however a smaller percentage of farmers did mention the duration of the sessions and strict adherence to program practices being a bit of an issue. Higher yield and improved quality of cotton were the main beneﬁts that about 86% and 57% farmers from the older PUs reported from being a part of the Better Cotton program as compared to 50% and 20% farmers from the newer PU. Further, more than 80% farmers from all the 3 PUs said that the opportunity to learn improved farming techniques, potential increase in income and improvement in soil health are 35 --- Page 37 --- the primary reasons that motivated them to join/ continue being a part of the Better Cotton programs. Figure No. 9 - FGD with male program farmers, Aarepally, INTL01 About 25% of the respondents from the 3 PUs stated that lack of time to attend the training (due to domestic and occupational chores) is a major challenge that they face in regularly attending the training sessions. Again, more than 85% farmers from the older PUs (INTL01 and 02) informed that they are able to grasp the information shared by the program staff, that they get opportunities to ask questions which the staff resolves successfully and that the facilitator gives equal attention to all participants. When questioned on the spillover effects, farmers from the older PUs spoke of better quality of soil and land health, better quality of harvest for other crops, increased knowledge, conﬁdence and thus enhancement of self-belief as the major positive outcomes that they have experienced. Responses to all these questions are slightly on the lower side for INTL23 respondents (as compared to INTL01 and 02), clearly indicating a higher need of training and facilitation support required by the participants from the newer PU. Differences between the two PUs were observed in terms of women participation in training and interest in maintaining FFBs. ● In INTL01, women&amp;#x27;s participation is notably low. Out of the 130 Better Cotton farmers in a village, only two to three are women with them primarily joining the program after the recent passing of their husbands. Despite this, these women actively engage in the training sessions and also participate in rallies. Participation of women in INTL23 is also low but they rarely attend meetings due to their commitments to domestic and agricultural work. ● Farmers of INTL01 showed a liking and interest towards maintaining FFBs. They ﬁll it diligently, either themselves or with the help of their children, and feel that it is useful to 36 --- Page 38 --- document their expenses. On the other hand, farmers of INTL23 mentioned that the majority of them do not maintain FFBs. Changes in Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) Related to Cotton Farming ● Previously, farmers relied heavily on Monocrotophos and a cocktail of harmful chemicals, spending substantial amounts on pesticides but achieving very poor crop yields. Through the guidance of the ﬁeld staff, they learned to not indulge in such hazardous practices. ● As a result, their costs have decreased, and crop yields have signiﬁcantly improved, leading to better prices in the market . While farmers once faced losses, the regular support and information from the program staff Ms. Damayanthi and Ms. Sony have enabled them to conduct soil tests. ● They have also started planting green grams and black grams as intercrops using organic fertilizers produced domestically , such as those made from neem trees. Previously, there was no guidance on these practices. Now, due to the impact of ﬁeld visits and meetings, farmers are using fewer pesticides, cultivating intercrops, and improving overall soil and plant health. ● Farmers of INTL01, reported that the quality of life for farmers has improved since joining the Better Cotton program —they have purchased chairs for their homes, educated their children, and upgraded their homes from Kaccha (non-durable) to Pakka (durable) houses. ● The use of machinery has also increased, reducing the need for manual labor. This includes the use of tractors, harvesting machines, and even cotton-removing machines. Farmers of both the PUs mentioned the need for free or subsidized PPE kits. Farmers from INTL23 have expressed a need for enhanced audio-visual training tools and improved safety materials . While there is overall satisfaction with the Better Cotton program, some farmers of INTL23 noted that not all recommended practices are consistently followed, such as the use of PPE kits. Perspectives of Lead Farmers The lead farmer is responsible for educating fellow farmers on various sustainable agricultural practices. This includes teaching about bio-pesticides (green and blue), stem applications, PPE kits, intercropping (with crops like red gram and green gram), pest management, and border crops. They advise against harmful pesticides like Monocrotophos and promote safer alternatives. The lead farmer also provides guidance on precautions related to water resources, the use of bio-fertilizers, and efﬁcient crop watering methods, such as alternating the watering of plant rows. Additionally, they emphasize safety measures, such as wearing gloves and masks during pesticide application, and demonstrate the use of pheromone traps. Both the lead farmers interviewed shared the common goal of wanting to educate their fellow farmers on best practices and ensuring that they also beneﬁt from lower investment costs and higher proﬁts, just like they did. 37 --- Page 39 --- Figure No. 10 - FF distributing Pamphlets to INTL01 farmers Out of their own interest, motivation and foresight in understanding the merit behind adoption of sustainable practices, the lead farmer 16 of INTL23 conducts ofﬁcial training sessions once a month and meets farmers as needed to address their doubts, often attending to their queries over the phone as well. The lead farmer further exclaimed that while rallies and audio-visual shows have been held, distributing pamphlets and displaying ﬂex boards during trainings have had the most signiﬁcant impact in educating farmers of sustainable cotton farming practices. In contrast, the lead farmer from INTL01 mentioned that demonstrations, rallies, and exposure visits have not yet been conducted, but there are plans to implement these activities in the future. Farmers from both the PUs expressed a liking towards maintaining FFBs as it helps them track their expenses and income. Interest of non program farmers in trainings Farmers are highly receptive to their lead farmers’ guidance and consistently follow their advice. In INTL23, even non-program farmers are actively participating in the training sessions and have expressed interest in joining the Better Cotton program, demonstrating its wider appeal and inﬂuence. Both lead farmers actively engage with non-program farmers, encouraging them to join, while farmers themselves often discuss the beneﬁts and drawbacks of new methods they have learned. However, the lead farmer from INTL02 noted that some farmers are hesitant to join the program due to concerns about attending numerous training sessions and dealing with extensive documentation requirements. Participation of women In both the villages, women were actively involved in farming activities such as watering, planting seeds, weeding, plucking crops, and assisting with pesticide spraying. Men typically handle more 16 The lead farmer does not get any remuneration for the work that he does in educating the other farmers. 38 --- Page 40 --- physically demanding tasks like plowing and spraying pesticides. The lead farmer of INTL02 mentioned that on his farm, there are around 20 farm workers, with women earning Rs. 500 per day and men earning Rs. 800 to 1,000 per day due to the more labor-intensive nature of their work. He stated that male and female workers are hired for doing different types of activities associated with cotton farming. Men are paid higher rates than women simply because the work they do is physically demanding or hazardous like carrying cotton bags, plowing the ﬁeld or spraying pesticides while women are generally involved in weeding and cotton plucking. These rates increase during peak seasons. Following are some of the challenges mentioned by lead farmer of INTL23: ● The biggest challenge they face is the pink bollworm, which signiﬁcantly impacts the quality of cotton. While using pheromone traps has helped somewhat, the problem persists as there is no effective pesticide available in the market to combat bollworms. ● The ﬂuctuating prices of cotton remain a major concern. ● The government usually provides red gram and green gram seeds free of cost, but it wasn’t done this time. Impact of the program Since joining the Better Cotton program, farmers (especially from the older PUs) mentioned that their yield per acre has increased noticeably. Previously, farmers focused solely on growing cotton throughout the year, but now, they have diversiﬁed their crops to include maize and yellow gram as border crops as well. This diversiﬁcation has not only boosted overall yields but has also allowed for intercropping of pulses. These pulses are used for household meals, leading to additional savings by reducing the need to purchase them from the market. Additional remarks on the social structure observed during trainings/meetings of the learning groups as inferred from interactions with the farmers and the ﬁeld staff have been mentioned in annexure 5.5 . iv) KPI 3 - Increased scope with similar project costs: KPI 3 - a) Area of cotton cropland covered under one single management system b) Volume of cotton eligible for Better Cotton licensing covered under one management system The area under cotton and volumes of cotton licensed, harvested and in the supply chain have undergone signiﬁcant changes in recent years. Data reviewed from secondary sources revealed the patterns of change in area and volumes of cotton over the years. As seen in the graph below, area under the cotton production (licensed for Better Cotton) has increased for all the PUs from 2021 to 2023 (except for a small drop in the cotton area for INTL01 from 2022 to 2023) which implies that the program farmers have been successful in bringing more of their land under sustainable cotton farming practices. On average, from 2021 to 2023, the area under cotton production has increased by 13.5% for INTL01, 7.5% for INTL02 and 16.5% for INTL23. 39 --- Page 41 --- Figure No. 11: Year-wise area under licensed Better Cotton production (Ha) by PU The volume of cotton harvested has also seen an overarching positive trend from 2021 to 2023. All the 3 PUs recorded a higher increase in cotton harvest (of cotton licensed under Better Cotton) from 2021 to 2022, with the harvest only slightly increasing from 2022 to 2023 for INTL02 and 23 and decreasing to some extent for INTL01. On average, from 2021 to 2023, the cotton production has increased by 6.65%, 8.15% and 14.58% for INTL01, 02 and 23 respectively. Actual MTs of cotton harvested for the 3 PUs from 2021 to 2023 is depicted in the graph below - Figure No. 12: Year-wise cotton harvested (MT) by PU 40 --- Page 42 --- Based on the MEL and assurance results, the Better Cotton team estimates and declares volumes of cotton that could be eligible for licensing and being taken up in the supply chain as ‘Better Cotton’. As represented in the graph below, the volume of cotton licensed as ‘Better Cotton’ also shows an increasing trend from 2021 to 2023. Since the amount of cotton eligible for licensing is decided based on the early season estimate, at times, the volume of licensed cotton is slightly higher than the actual amount of cotton harvested. However, similar to the cotton harvested, on average, the volume of licensed cotton has increased by 8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, 02 and 23 from 2021 to 2023 respectively. Figure No. 13: Year-wise volumes of cotton licensed (MT) by PU Of the cotton volumes licensed in 2021-22, about 86%, 75% and 97% from INTL01, 02 and 23 was actually absorbed in the supply chain by means of selling to a Better Cotton licensed ginner. However, no Better Cotton could be pushed into the supply chain in the years 2022-23 and 2023-24 as the program team has been encountering challenges with ginner registrations and had to deal with high administrative workloads for uploading uptake data in their dedicated portal. The year-wise uptake of licensed cotton in the supply chain is shown in the graph below. 41 --- Page 43 --- Figure No. 14: Year-wise uptake of licensed cotton in the supply chain (%) by PU On the whole, the cotton production landscape in the project area has seen signiﬁcant changes in recent years, with some farmers transitioning to paddy cultivation. This shift is largely due to the growing preference for mechanization, as cotton farming remains labor-intensive in comparison. Despite challenges, there has been a consistent overall increase in the area under cotton cultivation, as well as in the volumes harvested and licensed, with the exception of INTL01 during the 2022-23 period. This temporary decrease in INTL01 could likely be attributed to external factors. However, the positive trend in other regions highlights the resilience and adaptability of the farming communities, along with an increased number of farmer participation in the Better Cotton program. The increase in licensed cotton volumes over the years is a testament to the effectiveness of Better Cotton in optimizing resource utilization and ensuring sustainable practices. This is further expected to rise post-PU Rescoping as the amount of Better Cotton volume shall be fully accounted as against the current scenario wherein some Ginners spoke of having to mix the conventional cotton with the Better Cotton variant in the absence of the sufﬁcient volumes of Better Cotton . Owing to issues with ginner registrations and data entry, Better Cotton uptake in the supply chains has seen a drastic decline from 2021 to 2023 (with uptake being nil in 2022-23 and 2023-24). Resolution of such issues along with consideration of an entire geographic area as Better Cotton will ensure considerable increase in the overall quantity that ginners can easily segregate and process without having to mix it with conventional cotton. v) KPI 4 - Increased Conﬁdence of the rescoped approaches including: Assurance KPI4: Robust assurance approach that people have conﬁdence in In order to gauge the change in level of conﬁdence in assurance results at the endline (for the PU rescoping approach) necessitates understanding the assurance process at the baseline (for the traditional PUs) and inferring the level of conﬁdence that the assessors have in the process at 42 --- Page 44 --- present. To understand the assurance approach in detail, we spoke to WWF (Telangana) Staff including PUMs and project coordinator, the Assurance Coordinator at Better Cotton and a Third Party Veriﬁer. Assurance is a comprehensive process, taking place once every 3 years for each PU, aimed at verifying if PUs are complying with the Better Cotton standards of cotton production . It encompasses a range of activities, including licensing, assessments, and data veriﬁcation, to ensure that PUs adhere to the established principles and criteria. Under assurance there are data related compliance requirements in addition to the licensing of the PUs. These activities are generally time-bound to ensure timely compliance. ● Deﬁned Compliance Requirements: Within the assurance process, there are data related compliance requirements, for the various lists such as farmers list, adjusted ﬁgures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data . These requirements are integral to maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the data collected. ● Licensing : Assurance activities differ between new and existing PUs. For older PUs, an assessment visit is conducted before granting a license, which is typically valid for three years. Once the license is nearing expiration, Better Cotton conducts a re-assessment to renew it. ● Surveillance Assessment : This is conducted for PUs with an active license, particularly when there are changes in farmer participation or if a red ﬂag was raised during previous visits. The surveillance assessment ensures that the PU continues to comply with Better Cotton standards. The data received by the India Assurance team is checked for its quality. Each ﬁle is reviewed for proper formatting, correct units, and duplication. For different data sets, they have tailored data cleaning exercises. For instance, the RIR data is thoroughly checked by the MEL Global team, while the India Assurance team performs an initial review to catch any basic errors before their deeper analysis. The assurance team comprises two sets of assessors—one from Better Cotton and the other from third-party veriﬁers (3PVs). Currently, four organizations are empaneled as 3PVs, with assessors like Lalit leading a team of 4-5 people to conduct these assessments. PUs are notiﬁed one week in advance of an upcoming assessment. A template outlining the requirements is shared, and PUs are required to submit certain documents within three days before the assessment. The third-party veriﬁers are external entities brought in to ensure impartiality and objectivity in the veriﬁcation process. They conduct a thorough review and assessment of activities on the ground within a limited sample size, ensuring that the practices of the PU align with Better Cotton standards. They mainly conduct two types of audits - Licensing audits to assess whether PUs meet the criteria for licensing and Surveillance audits to assess risks and ensure that PUs continue to comply with Better Cotton standards over time. 43 --- Page 45 --- Figure No. 15 - Role of Better Cotton staff and Third Party Veriﬁers in the assurance process As shown in the ﬁgure above, the role of Better Cotton staff and 3PVs in the assessment process is largely the same, typically spanning a three-day exercise: ● Day 1: Opening Meeting ○ PUs provide an introduction or presentation. Better Cotton views PUMs as an effective and important point of contact between the farmers and them. If PUMs are educated, they will be able to pass the knowledge to FFs and ﬁnally to farmers. ○ Interviews with staff members are conducted. ○ Villages to be visited the following day are informed during this meeting. ● Day 2: Field Visits ○ Two LGs are visited, with at least ﬁve farmers interviewed from each LG. ○ Both farmers and ﬁeld workers are interviewed. ○ Villages for the third day&amp;#x27;s visit are announced on this day. ● Day 3: Final Visits and Closing Meeting ○ Morning: Visit one LG and interview ﬁve farmers. 44 --- Page 46 --- ○ While a minimum of three LGs must be interviewed throughout the assessment, there is ﬂexibility to interview more if necessary. ○ Post-lunch: Closing meeting with remarks. ○ No recommendations or feedback on the PU’s performance are provided during the meeting; all ﬁndings are included in the ﬁnal report. ● Reporting ○ After the assessment, a report is compiled and submitted to the India Assurance Team and the global assurance team. Licensing decisions are made by these teams. ○ 3PVs are required to submit their reports to the India Assurance Team as well. The Better Cotton staff and 3PVs conduct assessments separately, with a 60:40 ratio—60% of assessments are done by 3PVs, and 40% by Better Cotton staff. Better Cotton staff do not accompany the veriﬁers at all times, ensuring the independence of the third-party veriﬁcation process. Better Cotton supports veriﬁers with date coordination, Point of Contact (PoC) arrangements, and also provides training (annually 7 trainings) - both online and ofﬂine - to enhance the credibility of assessments. There are 64 indicators which the PU have to be compliant with, and non-compliance with even one of these indicators results in the loss of the license. It was understood that the license of INTL23 is pending while INTL01 and INTL02 have received their licenses in the past two years. Sampling Methodology and Challenges 17 Sampling is primarily used during Surveillance Assessments to ensure that a representative portion of Producer Units (PUs) is evaluated each year. The goal is to conﬁrm ongoing compliance with the Better Cotton Principles and Criteria (P&amp;amp;C) and to verify that any previous non-conformities have been resolved. Factors considered for calculating the Sample are: ● New Farmers: PUs with over 33% new farmers automatically receive a mandatory surveillance assessment. ● Non-Conformities: PUs that had a high rate of non-conformities in previous assessments are more likely to be selected for surveillance. ● Regional Balance: The sample aims to achieve a balanced distribution across different Programme Partners, Local Partners, and regions. ● Risk Factors: Information on speciﬁc risk factors, such as known sustainability issues or labor violations in a region, inﬂuences the sampling process. ● Size of the Sample: The total sample size for surveillance assessments is expected to cover around 5% of licensed Producers globally each year, although this may vary based on identiﬁed risks. Given the limited three-day timeframe for assessments, interviewing of 15 farmers is considered a fair sample size. To ensure the accuracy of their ﬁndings, the Better Cotton team also conduct Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and engage with local resources, such as pesticide shop owners and village leaders (sarpanch), to cross-check information. Therefore, the assessors claim that combination of 15 farmers, FGDs, and input from local resources provides a comprehensive and 17 Information source: Better Cotton Assurance Manual 45 --- Page 47 --- representative sample. When it comes to the 3PVs, Better Cotton provides them with a set of farmers, out of which they select 15 farmers using purposive sampling based on factors such as gender representation and geography, irrigation levels, etc to be surveyed for assurance purposes. The assurance team is experienced in communicating with farmers and familiar with the local geography, which facilitates the assessment process. The selection of LGs is done independently by the assessors, considering factors such as rain-fed farming practices, landholdings, gender, geographical distribution, and the response of FFs during the opening meeting. This approach helps prevent selection bias, while their objective interviewing techniques mitigate respondent bias. The scope of the assessment, including its duration and sample size, does impose some limitations on the assessors&amp;#x27; ability to cover all aspects thoroughly. However, if they ﬁnd that three LGs are insufﬁcient or if results are inconclusive, they have the ﬂexibility to expand the sample to include four or ﬁve LGs. The 3PVs encounter challenges when local partners fail to effectively execute their responsibilities and provide adequate support, resulting in delays and time constraints . This issue is particularly pronounced when the sample includes distant locations, such as villages more than 100 km apart, making it difﬁcult to thoroughly cross-check farmers&amp;#x27; lists and other data. Additionally, the 3PVs also ﬁnd three days insufﬁcient to conduct in-depth interviews. The 3PV further added that it would be helpful if data pertaining to PUs other than the one they are visiting is also shared with them so that they have a holistic understanding of the ﬁeld they are visiting. Currently, the narrow scope of data (shared for only the PU that they are visiting) makes cross-checking difﬁcult is what he said. It was also mentioned that there have been instances where disqualiﬁed PUs or LGs simply rebranded themselves while retaining the same farmers, complicating the veriﬁcation process more. When asked about the means of veriﬁcation used, the assurance coordinator Lalit stated that the FGDs and information from local resources help them to validate and triangulate their ﬁndings. Expectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors and support provided by Better Cotton The Better Cotton team expects assessors to clearly communicate all requirements to partners, ensuring they fully understand what is expected of them. Activities should be planned proactively, providing partners with sufﬁcient notice to prepare and submit the necessary information on time. Better Cotton places a strong emphasis on maintaining the quality of ﬁeld data, with thorough investigations conducted to ensure its accuracy and reliability. To ensure smoothness in the assurance processes, Better Cotton assurance team has a dedicated Relationship Management team. While the team has many more responsibilities, the one relevant to this project include maintaining close communication with WWF (Telangana), to ensure that partners receive the standard protocols necessary for compliance. While partners are given the ﬂexibility to design their own meetings and training calendars, they must adhere to the established principles. Risks Considered During Assessments To mitigate risks, the assurance team requests partners to provide them with suitable dates for assessments, as they previously encountered scheduling conﬂicts with local festivals. Recently, one PU informed them of stafﬁng issues, where all had been terminated, leading them to request an extension. In such cases, they evaluate the availability of key staff members. If a particular staff member is not crucial to the assessment, they proceed as planned. Additionally, weather conditions 46 --- Page 48 --- can affect the process, as farmers are often less willing to engage during unfavorable weather. These factors are carefully considered to ensure the effectiveness of the assessments. Before the assessment, 3PVs do a risk proﬁling, wherein they conduct interviews with three independent stakeholders who are not directly associated with the PU (e.g., KVK, Sarpanch, school teachers) without informing the PU. These interviews provide valuable insights into potential risks and issues, such as child labor, farmer suicides, and other sector-speciﬁc challenges, which helps them be better prepared for the assessment . Additionally, the 3PVs conduct daily cross-checks and data triangulation using secondary sources and historical data throughout the assessment process. This approach allows them to address and clarify any discrepancies in real-time during the assessment. Factors Contributing to Non-Compliance Among Farmers The assurance coordinator mentioned non-compliance was observed amongst few farmers of the PUs. He stated that several factors contribute to non-compliance among farmers. One signiﬁcant issue is the adoption of PPE kits, which they encourage for safety, but farmers often avoid using them because they feel uncomfortable using them in unfavorable weather conditions. Additionally, extension agents or pesticide vendors sometimes advise farmers to mix chemicals, leading to practices that go against the Better Cotton guidelines. Another challenge is the use of certain chemicals banned by Better Cotton, like monocrotophos, which farmers continue to use because they are inexpensive and readily available. To combat these issues, the assurance team have launched campaigns 18 aimed at discouraging such non-compliant behaviors and promoting safer, compliant practices. Level of Conﬁdence in Assurance Results While there are no signiﬁcant challenges in the assurance process beyond the risks previously mentioned, the remote locations of some LGs can make travel between farmer households time-consuming and logistically challenging, for both the 3PVs and Better Cotton assurance team. When asked about how the existing assurance systems and processes are designed to mitigate the risks associated with free riders and non-Better Cotton farmers, the Better Cotton assurance coordinator Lalit mentioned that given the resource constraints, it is not feasible to have comprehensive details on all farmers. As a result, the possibility of free riders cannot be entirely eliminated, even within the PURE framework. Although the objective of PURE is not to completely eliminate free riders but to minimize the risk—keeping it at the same level or reducing it compared to the current approach—the process requires ongoing monitoring and adaptive strategies to ensure that the framework remains effective in curbing free rider behavior without compromising the overall goals of the program. Despite these limitations, he stated that their assurance mechanisms strive to minimize the impact of such risks by implementing rigorous checks and balances, though the challenge of fully eliminating non-compliance persists. To summarize, the assurance coordinator has a high level of conﬁdence in all the processes related to assurance , as seen from the table below. The ‘level of conﬁdence’ is on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest. 18 In the discussion with the assurance coordinator, it was clearly stated that they have launched campaigns to discourage certain non-compliant behaviors of Better Cotton farmers. 47 --- Page 49 --- Processes Aspects Level of Conﬁdence Comments from assurance coordinator Pre Season Information Duration 3 Systems in place for verifying pre-season estimate is ‘good’ (Not a PU requirement—it’s at the program partner level, with a template provided to them. No impact on licensing. Sample size 3 Approach 3 Reporting 3 Early season estimate (farmers list) Duration 3 Entire list is not shared with the India Assurance team. Sample size NA Approach 3 Reporting NA Self-assessment Duration 3 Distributed to each PU in advance—submission is mandatory one month after harvest. It does not have any implication on licensing - normative requirement. Sample size NA Approach 3 Reporting NA Licensing/ Surveillance Assessment Duration 3 Sample size is representative, as the LG selection is based on factors like rain-fed farming, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, and FF responses. Assessors handle LG selection to prevent selection bias, and objectivity is maintained to avoid respondent bias. Sample size 3 Approach 3 Reporting 3 CAP Closure Process Approach 2 It’s not very reliable due to limited probing; NCs provide training feedback, but we lack means to directly talk to farmers and cross-verify. Reporting 3 PUs report directly to them, and they simply acknowledge receipt without further reporting to Better Cotton. Table No 7: Level of Conﬁdence rating by assurance coordinator As understood from the Third Party Veriﬁer , the level of conﬁdence in the assurance process is ‘high’. Factors like the ability of the 3PV to choose the sample independently and the systematic approach of daily data triangulation 19 drives the conﬁdence of the third party veriﬁer. The sample size is considered robust, even though it may be small, the random selection approach provided by Better Cotton is viewed positively. 19 It was mentioned by the 3PV that veriﬁers carry out daily data triangulation, comparing and cross-referencing the new data with previous indicators. 48 --- Page 50 --- vi) KPI 5 - Increased Conﬁdence of the rescoped approaches including: MEL KPI 5: Relevant MEL data that can be used with other global MEL data, and that provides credible, high-quality data The MEL approach used in the traditional PU system and the level of conﬁdence that the stakeholders have in it would serve as the baseline for comparison with the MEL approach used in the rescoped PU and to determine the change in level of conﬁdence at the endline. To understand the MEL approach used for monitoring the traditional PUs, we spoke to the PUMs and Sonal Dhingra, the Senior Coordinator - Global MEL - Better Cotton. Role of Producer Unit Managers in MEL Once the data is collected from the ﬁeld by the FFs, it is the responsibility of the PUM to check and verify it before sharing it with the Better Cotton team. The following set of lists/data sets 20 are managed by the PUMs - ● Soil health assessments - Soil organic carbon levels are analyzed to determine if they have increased or decreased compared to the previous data. After FFs compile soil testing data, PUM converts it into a prescribed Better Cotton format and shares it with the project coordinator. ● Farmers List (early season estimates) - The PUM cross-checks this data by calling selected farmers to verify their information and identify any outliers. ● Annual Planning Data - This includes developing time-bound plans based on key issues collected by Field Facilitators (FFs). Each year, PUMs prepare an activity plan and a monitoring plan. ● List of pesticides - A list of pesticides used locally is maintained by the PUM ● List of disadvantaged individuals - Identiﬁes physically handicapped individuals for livelihood support and collaborates with government schemes. ● Identiﬁcation of degraded lands - PUMs manage data on degraded lands, including identiﬁcation and restoration plans. ● Attendance data - FFs maintain a diary for recording minutes for every training and meetings that they conduct with the learning groups. PUM cross checks if the minutes are recorded properly. ● Adoption data - Digitizing the data shared by FFs into excel sheets ● Farmer Field Books - Cross checking only when on ﬁeld visits ● RIR data - Collect RIR related data on internally developed excel sheets and then transfer them to Better Cotton mandated RIR data format. While speaking to the PUMs, it was understood that under MEL processes, cross-checking is a critical component that they are responsible for. For each document, a percentage of the data is reviewed to ensure accuracy. Typically, 10% to 20% of data from each FF is considered. For example, if an FF oversees four villages, 10% of data from each village is sampled and cross-checked by the PUM. The percentage of cross-checked data varies: 10%-20% for larger populations and 5%-10% for smaller ones, a standard set decided internally by WWF. Typically, the APUM checks 40% to 50% of data, the PUM checks 10%, and the project coordinator checks 3 to 20 The list of datasets mentioned here is managed by the PUM for internal MEL or project implementation activities, even though it may not necessarily be submitted to the Better Cotton MEL team. 49 --- Page 51 --- 5%. As per the PUMs, this rigorous process is reliable, as any identiﬁed issues are further cross-checked by the FF to ensure accuracy. The time spent on MEL activities, for PUMs, varies with the season. Currently, one of the PUM is focusing on preparing farmers&amp;#x27; lists, which takes about 1-2 weeks. Her workload will shift to other data sets as the season progresses. Figure No. 16 - Role of FF, APUM, PUM &amp;amp; PC in MEL process When asked about the challenges faced in execution of MEL responsibilities while the PUM of INTL01 mentioned that she faces no challenge, PUM of INTL23 mentioned that meeting strict deadlines is a signiﬁcant challenge, especially when farmers delay the provision of necessary data. This delay also makes it difﬁcult for FFs to collect data on time. However, these challenges do not impact the ﬁnal project outcomes. Additionally, there is an internal deadline set by the Project Coordinator, before the ofﬁcial Better Cotton project deadline, adding to the time management pressures. 50 --- Page 52 --- When asked about the efﬁciency of MEL systems in place, the PUM of INTL23 mentioned that it would be better if the PUMs checked 20 to 30% of data instead of the current practice of checking only 10%. However, she later added that since PUMs are burdened with data work, the percentage of cross-checks is kept lower for them. Overview of work done by the Senior Coordinator, Global MEL, Better Cotton The senior coordinator MEL along with another coordinator is essentially responsible for looking after two data sets - the Reach Data (covering area, number of farmers, and production) and the Result Indicators Report (RIR) data , which involves collecting data from sampled farmers to assess factors like water and pesticide usage (organic versus chemical etc). The senior coordinator receives the RIR data 12 weeks after harvest, after which she conducts a gap analysis to ensure completeness and validity of the data, checking for inconsistencies such as irrigated area exceeding cultivated area or missing pesticide details. If issues arise, partners are contacted for clariﬁcation. Data is recorded in a speciﬁc format, moving from FFB to the RIR, with potential issues ﬂagged during gap analysis. Following the gap analysis, an outlier check is done to identify data points that are signiﬁcantly different from the average values, for instance, the average cotton yield of each PU is compared to individual farm yields. Signiﬁcant discrepancies, such as a PU cotton yield of 135 kg/ha versus a farm yield of 1000 kg/ha, prompt further investigation, which may reveal either data errors or genuine issues. This process involves extensive coordination between country MEL, global MEL, and the partners. It was also mentioned that the senior coordinator handles - Cotton Cloud, a power BI dashboard that is developed in-house to keep a record of the how much chemicals/pesticides PUs have used, income variation across seasons, etc. The data ﬂow from farmers to the RIR involves changing hands multiple times: FFBs managed by FFs, oversight by PUMs and MEL personnel at the partner level, and ﬁnal aggregation by partners in internal Excel sheets before being entered into the Better Cotton mandated RIR excel sheet. PUMs typically complete the data collection and entry for RIR with assistance from FFs or MEL staff. Reporting Requirements Mandated by Better Cotton MEL for PUs ● Reach Data is broken down into multiple parts, including early season estimates and post-harvest estimates. While the former involves reporting on farmers expected to grow cotton, which is later updated to reﬂect actual ﬁgures in terms of area, production, and the ﬁnal number of farmers engaged (late estimate data), the latter is expected to capture outcomes from the season. ● RIR Data: The RIR data comprises three main sheets: Area and Production, Fertilizer Use and Pesticide Use. ● Training Data: Details of all the training sessions conducted during the season, including training descriptions, duration, attendance, and differentiation between training for farmers and workers. 51 --- Page 53 --- ● Contextual Information: Introduced three years ago, it includes questions at the PU level, such as whether water levels or costs were higher than the previous year. This contextual data helps explain anomalies or outliers in the other reports. These reports are essential for tracking the progress and compliance of PUs with Better Cotton standards. Timeliness of Data Reporting Generally, there are no signiﬁcant delays from the partner WWF, as the reporting deadline is three months after the harvest. WWF typically reports diligently and on time. However, when Better Cotton requests clariﬁcations, it often takes time for partners to respond. Despite this, the actual sharing of the RIR (Result Indicators Report) typically meets deadlines. Rectifying Data Collection and Entry Errors The senior coordinator also mentioned a common issue that many farmers within a PU face - they report the same yield, which raises concerns about accuracy. This could be due to guesstimating, but in some cases, it could be genuine, as nearby farmers experience the same climatic conditions and pest attacks. There’s also the challenge of units of land size conversion. Farmers often know their land size in bigha, but Better Cotton requires data in hectares (ha), leading to potential inaccuracies during conversion. Similarly, fertilizers are sometimes reported in milliliters (ML) rather than kilograms, causing further complications. Another issue that is reported is that small farmers not having weighing machines, do not always know how much cotton they have produced and sold. It is then recommended that FFs check sale receipts to ensure accurate reporting. Sampling Methodology &amp;amp; its representativeness Prior to COVID-19, the sampling methodology for selecting farmers included two types: Better Cotton farmers and Lead farmers, with every LG having one Lead farmer. The sampling approach involved using a 95% conﬁdence interval and a 5% margin of error. For a PU with around 3,500 farmers, this meant selecting 500 to 600 farmers, including all Lead farmers (100 to 125) and Better Cotton farmers. The methodology involved randomly selecting 10 LGs out of 100 for any given PU, and then choosing all farmers within those selected LGs, amounting to about 350 farmers. The remaining 90 LGs were used to select Lead farmers. The senior coordinator informed that this sampling approach, while focused on ensuring a representative analysis of LGs, had its ﬂaws. The unit of analysis was the PU, and while Better Cotton farmers were randomly selected, Lead farmers were not. This created a methodological ﬂaw, as comparisons between Lead farmers and Better Cotton farmers, as well as between Better Cotton farmers and non-Better Cotton farmers within the same PU were made . Despite these issues, only comparisons between Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton farmers were reported externally, as the sampling of Lead farmers was not random. Post COVID-19, the sampling methodology was adjusted. From 2020 to 2023, the sampling methodology mandated that the conﬁdence interval remain at 95%, but the margin of error be increased to 10%, reducing the effective sample size to 200 farmers per PU - 100 Lead farmers and 100 Better Cotton farmers . The new methodology involved randomly selecting 10 LGs, from which 9 Better Cotton farmers were randomly chosen, plus 1 Lead farmer from the remaining LGs, resulting in a total of 200 farmers. 52 --- Page 54 --- While 50% of the PUs continued with this same approach, for the remaining 50% another pilot was launched in 2023-24, which aimed at reducing the workload burden from FFs which meant reducing the FFB distribution and monitoring support to only 5 farmers each LG based on feedback that too much time was spent on this task. The adjustments made post COVID-19 have increased conﬁdence in the methodology, making it more representative. However, there is a suggestion that the selection of Lead farmers should have been scrapped altogether to further improve the MEL process. Lead farmers were not randomly selected, unlike Better Cotton farmers, which introduces bias in the comparisons between Lead farmers, Better Cotton farmers, and non-Better Cotton farmers. This non-random selection undermines the representativeness and reliability of the sampling process. Overall, she could only rate her conﬁdence in the MEL approach for the RIR data, as that is her primary area of responsibility. The ‘level of conﬁdence’ is on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest. MEL Processes Aspects Level of Conﬁdence Comments from Senior Coordinator, MEL RIR / Final Post Harvest Data Duration 3 She expressed conﬁdence in the duration Sample size 2.5 Post-COVID-19 adjustments have improved conﬁdence in the methodology, but there&amp;#x27;s a suggestion to eliminate Lead farmer selection to further enhance the MEL process. Approach 2.5 It is good enough compared to what Better Cotton was doing ﬁve years back Reporting 2.5 No comments Table No 8: Level of Conﬁdence rating by MEL senior coordinator When asked about the means of veriﬁcation, it was mentioned that the MEL team is currently under-resourced for conducting thorough veriﬁcations, indicating signiﬁcant room for improvement. Country workshops are being held to enhance collaboration with partners, which will help us establish stronger connections and improve our processes. vii) KPI 7 - Increased efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: Supply chain KPI 7: Supply chain credibility and trust related to claimed volumes Strengthening the Supply Chain and Marketing Dynamics The marketing of Better Cotton has traditionally relied on a strong and grounded supply chain connection directly between farmers and the ginners, most of whom are Better Cotton registered. Although some disruptions have been noted, particularly due to the ﬂexibility that Better Cotton farmers have in choosing where to sell their cotton (depending on price or already established connections with local traders), the overall volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing have continued to rise. 53 --- Page 55 --- Over the years, Better Cotton has witnessed a steady and positive uptake across various regions, reﬂecting stability and growth in cotton production. This progress has been bolstered by the expansion of cotton ginning industries, particularly in areas like Jammikunta. According to Mukka Narayana, a seasoned ginner from Jammikunta, who has been in the cotton sector since 1997, the launch of the Technology Mission on Cotton in 2000 and its subsequent popularization in 2008, mechanized operations have become more prevalent, signiﬁcantly enhancing processing capacity and stabilizing cotton prices over time. These advancements have collectively contributed to a more resilient and efﬁcient cotton supply chain. Financial and Operational Constraints on Ginners According to the supply chain coordinator Robin, ginners face signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and operational constraints that impede their ability to fully comply with Better Cotton’s requirements to segregate and process the Better Cotton. The cost-intensive nature of maintaining separate facilities and processes for Better Cotton, combined with ﬂuctuating cotton prices, presents a considerable challenge . Ginners have highlighted the need for ﬁnancial support or subsidies from Better Cotton or other stakeholders to help mitigate these costs . Without such support, there is a risk that ginners may deprioritize the separation and processing of Better Cotton, potentially compromising the credibility of the supply chain. This risk is however expected to be mitigated after the PU Rescoping which is expected to allow the ginners to bulk the cotton from a geography as Better Cotton. Marketing and Distribution Complexities Farmers typically market their cotton through two primary channels: the Government Market Yard, which operates from 6 AM to 9 AM, or by directly transporting their produce to preferred ginning mills. In both scenarios, the transportation cost is borne by the farmer, a factor that sometimes prompts them to sell their cotton to private parties. However, transactions with private parties are fraught with risks, as payments are often made on credit, with only partial payments at the time of sale. This arrangement can lead to fraudulent activities, putting the farmers at a disadvantage. Despite the regulated environment of the government marketplace, where transactions involve approved agents, and the direct transport to ginners, where negotiations occur directly in between the farmer and the ginner, challenges persist. The decentralized and dispersed distribution network complicates the accumulation of sufﬁcient quantities of Better Cotton within a speciﬁc timeframe. As a result, ginners often mix conventional cotton with Better Cotton, which undermines the traceability and credibility of the supply chain. Inﬂuence of Local Market Dynamics Local market dynamics, including competition from conventional cotton buyers and the impact of government policies on cotton pricing, play a crucial role in shaping the decisions of both farmers and ginners. In many cases, these dynamics lead ginners to prioritize conventional cotton due to better immediate returns. This prioritization can undermine the separation and traceability of Better Cotton, affecting the overall integrity of the supply chain. Key Disruptors and Adaptations The program farmers interviewed also mentioned certain issues which affect their ability to cultivate cotton using sustainable practices and ensure its uptake in the Better Cotton supply chain. Their major areas of concern are listed below - 54 --- Page 56 --- A number of farmers have shifted from cotton to paddy due to irregular monsoons and the superior mechanization in the paddy cultivation” - FGD of Male Program Farmers, Chityalappali (INTL23) 1. Impact of Irregular Monsoons on Cotton Production: While the recent monsoon season brought challenges, particularly in terms of rainfall scarcity, the program&amp;#x27;s emphasis on sustainable farming practices has helped mitigate some of these impacts. Farmers have been equipped with techniques to better manage water resources, and have been trained on border croppings and inter croppings, leading to more stable yields despite adverse weather conditions. However, there have been multiple suggestions from farmers as well as Field Facilitators for an improved intervention on irrigation facilities from Better Cotton in terms of providing the necessary equipment and tools, as well as guidance for water management. 2. Shift Towards Mechanized Farming: The labor-intensive nature of cotton farming has driven some farmers to explore alternatives, such as paddy cultivation. With paddy cultivation becoming extremely machine driven, the farmers get ample amount of time for other activities as well. On the other hand, cotton being primarily labor driven increases the cost as well as the effort. 3. Disease and Pest Infestations: Pest-related challenges, such as locust infestations, have been a signiﬁcant concern. However, the program’s focus on integrated pest management and the use of resistant cotton varieties have played a crucial role in reducing the impact of these threats, thereby supporting the overall increase in licensed cotton volumes. The 3rd party veriﬁers spoke of the expected improvement in this aspect with the introduction of Rescoping, allowing the interventions to be conducted on a geographical area rather than on Better Cotton farmers alone. Challenges with Better Cotton Certiﬁcation and Compliance Better Cotton has established connections with approximately 250-270 ginners across the country, who are certiﬁed annually after participating in a mandatory one-day training session. These ginners are required to separate Better Cotton from conventional cotton during processing. However, Better Cotton’s policy of allowing farmers the ﬂexibility to choose when and where to sell their cotton has led to a dispersed distribution network. This situation creates challenges for ginners, who struggle to accumulate sufﬁcient quantities of Better Cotton variant at any given time, often resulting in the unintended mixing of conventional and Better Cotton. Additionally, some of the cotton ends up with ginners who are not registered with Better Cotton, leading to gaps in traceability and difﬁculties in accurately reporting the volumes collected. The dispersed nature of Better Cotton supply further complicates the ginners&amp;#x27; ability to process it separately, leading to logistical constraints and a lack of motivation among ginners to maintain their Better Cotton licenses. Without any additional incentives or support from Better Cotton, many ginners express reluctance in continuing with the program, further jeopardizing the integrity of the Better Cotton supply chain. The timing of cotton sales is often dictated by the farmers&amp;#x27; immediate ﬁnancial needs rather than the scientiﬁc consideration of storage. Farmers usually sell their cotton according to convenience, sometimes storing it for 6-8 months, which can degrade the quality of the cotton. This lack of 55 --- Page 57 --- adherence to scientiﬁc storage practices further complicates the supply chain and reduces the overall quality of the product reaching the market. Ginners also face signiﬁcant challenges in the current system to differentiate Better Cotton from conventional cotton . Since there is practically no major outward difference between the two varieties, ginners can only crosscheck the Better Cotton Farmers List as an evidence for the produced cotton to be considered as Better Cotton. Practically hence, the Better Cotton farmer can only put forth his certiﬁcation as a negotiating tool with the ginner; instances of Better Cotton farmers demanding high price have also been reported from the ginners which the ginner is reluctant to pay. Added to these, some conventional cotton growers remain resistant to adopting Better Cotton’s recommended practices. Many of these growers do not perceive signiﬁcant value in altering their established methods which they have been practicing for years, speciﬁcally as they already achieve satisfactory quality and yields with their current practices. This resistance to change poses additional challenges in expanding the uptake of Better Cotton within the supply chain. Figure No. 17 - Cotton Ginning Mill, Jammikunta Role of Supply Chain Coordinator Supply Chain Coordinator manages audits, reviews reports, and builds capacity, particularly within the ginning segment. This role involves overseeing capacity-building programs for ginners, ensuring compliance with CoC standards throughout the supply chain, from ginners to end manufacturers. These programs are typically held in August and September. Monitoring and audits are central to the role, with a focus on addressing ginners’ queries and providing technical assistance on the Better 56 --- Page 58 --- Cotton platform. The Better Cotton process includes onboarding ginners located within a 50 to 100 km radius of PUs to ensure proximity to farmers. Each ginner is assigned a unique code, and participation is free. However, the credibility of the system is challenged by the potential mixing of Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton during transportation and processing. To mitigate this, regular visits to ginners are conducted during the active season from September to March to enforce segregation standards. Traceability is crucial to the role, requiring ginners to maintain detailed records at the farmer level, including transportation methods, quantities purchased, and the source of the cotton—whether directly from farmers or through middlemen. Supporting documents, such as purchase slips, quantity slips, and transportation records, must be meticulously kept. A key challenge arises when ginners cannot dispatch separate vehicles for Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton, heightening the risk of mixing. To address this, segregation practices are emphasized during training sessions, and vehicle records are scrutinized during assessments to mitigate this risk. The supply chain is complex, involving multiple stages from ginners to traders, spinners, yarn producers, fabric manufacturers, and ﬁnally, brands. The Better Cotton platform records the quantity of cotton purchased but does not track pricing, which is negotiated between buyers and sellers. Once cotton is recorded on the Better Cotton platform, it enters the Better Cotton supply chain, though not all Better Cotton-produced cotton may end up in the value chain if sold elsewhere, posing a challenge to system credibility. Gaps between ginners and farmers, especially in regions like Tamil Nadu, where ginners have limited information about farmers, further complicate credibility. The uptake of Better Cotton often falls short of the expected AAV for each PU, leading to inconsistencies in reported volumes. While ginners maintain physical traceability, limitations arise as cotton moves further along the supply chain. The system employs two models for CoC: physical traceability and mass balance (MB). The physical model requires strict separation of Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton at every stage, though the risk of mixing remains. The MB model is more ﬂexible, using BCCUs (Better Cotton claim units) to represent the quantity of lint cotton sold. However, audits are conducted to ensure that these points are only transferred when there is an actual physical transaction, preserving the system’s credibility. Ginners’ Perspectives and Future Outlook Ginners have expressed optimism about the potential beneﬁts of a geographic rescoping approach, which is expected to facilitate better collectivization and easier categorization of cotton varieties. Such a system is expected to improve the efﬁciency of the supply chain by doing away with having to process Better Cotton and conventional cotton separately, thus addressing one of the major challenges faced by ginners at present. There is a strong case for adopting a more scientiﬁc approach to post-harvest management. Given that farmers often sell their produce based on convenience rather than scientiﬁc storage timings, promoting better storage practices and speciﬁc duration for sales could signiﬁcantly improve the quality of cotton and the overall efﬁciency of the supply chain . Ginners suggest that post-harvest marketing of Better Cotton should be collectivized, with assistance from Better Cotton to enhance both the farmers&amp;#x27; negotiating power as well as convenience for ginners in the market. Additionally, extending Better Cotton incentives to non-program farmers could motivate more growers to gradually adopt Better Cotton practices, thereby strengthening the supply chain and improving 57 --- Page 59 --- traceability. This is expected to be better addressed with the rescoping approach owing to the new approach’ focus on expanding its reach to all farmers within a geography. 58 --- Page 60 --- viii) Key Stakeholder inputs Stakeholder 1.

Limitations Certain limitations associated with the execution of the baseline study of the PU rescoping intervention are given below - a) While care has been taken to clearly outline and quantify wherever possible the qualitative interactions with all the stakeholders, the contextual and subjective nature of ﬁndings associated with qualitative outcomes could limit the effective comparison of the baseline ﬁndings with the endline. b) Perspectives of women farmers (though obtained qualitatively) could not be gathered from the quantitative surveys as it was extremely difﬁcult to locate women program farmers, given the low reach of the program towards women farmers at present. c) Given the context-speciﬁc nature of the intervention, it could prove challenging to prove the external validity of the study necessary for scaling of the initiative. *** 62 --- Page 64 --- 5.

Observations based on the social structure Caste as a social factor was observed to play a crucial role in the day to day activities of the learning groups such as meetings and trainings. It was reported during the qualitative interactions with farmers and FFs that separate seating arrangements are made, as per preexisting social hierarchy, for farmers coming from the different caste groups present in the village. The powerful castes took the front rows while the marginalized castes, speciﬁcally communities including the dalits, were given seats at the end. The FFs put forth this as a necessary arrangement so as to ensure that there’s no inﬁghting within the learning groups. At least in a few villages, the learning groups are at times, said to be constituted on the basis of caste. 21 Each FGD constituted of 7-10 participants 64</Content>

WWF World Wildlife Fund 20. 3PV Third Party Veriﬁers 3 --- Page 5 --- Executive Summary Better Cotton’s Producer Unit rescoping intervention has been designed with the 3-fold aims of (i) Enhancing capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. (ii) Improving efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. (iii) Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms. The new approach also necessitates relevant changes in the assurance, MEL and traceability approaches undertaken so that they are able to attest to the quality and volumes of Better Cotton supplied with a higher degree of conﬁdence. To pilot this intervention, the three Producer Units (INTL01, INTL02, and INTL23) located in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of Telangana will be reorganized into a single, larger Producer Unit. This new unit will not only cover the area previously managed by the three units but will also incorporate new villages and farming households (FHH) from both existing and newly added villages. Baseline approach The baseline evaluation of the Producer unit rescoping intervention seeks to validate the problem statements and establish the values of the seven major key performance indicators of the project at the baseline (prior to implementation of the intervention) so that measurement of the same KPIs at the endline (post the intervention) is able to provide sufﬁcient evidence on the successful implementation of the PU rescoping approach along with nuanced insights on scaling up of the initiative. In-depth qualitative interactions with a majority of the stakeholders and quantitative surveys of 120 farmers served as the primary source of data for this study; with secondary data being referred to gather information on a select few indicators. Efforts involved in data collection Interactions with the ﬁeld staff revealed that a considerable amount of their time does go into data collection. Throughout the farming season, a fair amount of information on cotton cultivation is gathered using data collection exercises such as early season estimates, farmer ﬁeld books, post harvest estimates, RIR and soil health is collected from the farmers. Overall, FFs report spending nearly 30 to 45% on such data related work, 20 to 30% on administrative work and 25% to 50% on capacity strengthening of farmers. The PUMs also spend a good portion of their time on verifying the data sent by FFs. They reported that the process of manually collecting information, verifying and uploading the same in soft copies is particularly cumbersome. Even while being inherently motivated to put in a higher number of hours doing ﬁeld work, the ﬁeld staff mentioned that working closely with farmers is what enables them to understand the issues faced by the farmers in adoption of practices in turn contributing towards Better Cotton’s sustainability objectives. Hence, a strong desire to reduce efforts involved in data collection and increase time spent in strengthening the capacity of the farmers was evidenced from the baseline study. Women Participation The focus and reach of Better Cotton programs towards women farmers is on the lower side at present. In a traditional PU catering to around 3000-3500 farmers, ~98% are men, and ~2% to 3% are women. Women are keen to be a part of the Better Cotton program primarily because of beneﬁts such as enhancement in the quality of their crops and being able to ﬁnancially support their 4 --- Page 6 --- households. Interestingly, the uptake of practices (such as intercropping, border cropping, optimizing land use and improving crop diversity) and accrual of beneﬁts was noted to be much higher for women farmers and co-farmers belonging to the INTL01/02 PUs as compared to the relatively newer INTL23. Non-program farmers also expressed their interest in becoming a program farmer and adopting Better Cotton practices, provided the training sessions are held at a time, frequency and duration of their convenience. All the aforementioned remarks point towards the need for a higher extent of capacity strengthening efforts to be directed towards women farmers, especially those from the newer PUs. Effectiveness of the Better Cotton program Inferences from quantitative surveys of the program farmers (mostly male) provides credible evidence towards the quality and efﬁcacy of the training sessions while also indicating farmer preferences for more audio-visual training content and farm exposure visits. Similar to data gathered from the qualitative interactions with women program farmers, the quantitative surveys also revealed that the extent of adoption of Better Cotton practices was higher in members of the older PU (INTL01/02) as compared to the newer one (INTL23). It was also noted that getting to learn new topics (94%), followed by the teaching approach of the facilitator (72%), handholding support provided in adoption of practices (61%) and going on exposure visits (91%) were the major reasons for farmers from the older PU to continue being a part of the program. Higher yield and improved quality of cotton were the main beneﬁts that about 86% and 57% farmers from the older PUs reported from being a part of the Better Cotton program as compared to 50% and 20% farmers from the newer PU. The uptake of practices was lesser in INTL23 mainly due an earlier dissatisfying experience that they had with adoption of sustainable farming practices. Better Cotton harvest Analysis of secondary data available on the cotton area, volumes licensed and harvested denotes an overall increasing trend from 2021 to 2023. Volumes of Better cotton harvested have increased, on average, by 6.65%, 8.15% and 14.58% for INTL01, 02 and 23 respectively from 2021 to 2023. Assurance approach The assurance approach practiced traditionally was described as a comprehensive process. The licensing assessments take place in 3 years for each PU and are aimed at verifying if PUs are in compliance with the Better Cotton standards of cotton production. The third-party veriﬁer mentioned doing a risk proﬁling before the assessment, wherein interviews are conducted with three independent stakeholders not directly associated with the PU. The Better Cotton assurance coordinator expressed a good degree of conﬁdence in the assurance system being used at present. Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning approach The MEL coordinator elaborated on the MEL systems and processes put in place to continuously monitor the different types of data required - mainly reach, farmer lists and RIR. Thorough checking and veriﬁcation of inconsistencies in data takes place at every stage of data collection and reporting. A moderate-to-high degree of conﬁdence was expressed by the coordinator in the MEL approach utilized, while also highlighting a small ﬂaw in sampling of lead farmers as compared to the program farmers. 5 --- Page 7 --- Supply chain credibility Interactions with the supply chain coordinator and the ginner brought out pressing issues affecting Better Cotton uptake and supply chain credibility. It was mentioned that given the low volumes of Better Cotton being procured by the ginners in the region, it is difﬁcult for him to segregate and process it separately as against the processing of conventional cotton. The supply chain coordinator also reiterated the fact that the credibility of the system gets challenged by the potential mixing of Better Cotton and conventional cotton during transportation and processing. To mitigate this, regular visits to ginners are conducted during the active season from September to March to enforce segregation standards. Validation of Problem statements and Recommendations Findings from the baseline bring forth substantial evidence for the issues - such as the amount of efforts spent in data and administration, low participation of women farmers in the Better Cotton initiatives, less volumes of Better Cotton processed in the supply chain, and the associated assurance and MEL systems - that the PU rescoping intervention intends to address. Recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the pilot intervention, from the point of view of the major stakeholders, have been listed below. Recommendations to programme design FFs, PUMs, &amp;amp; PC ● Organize meetings speciﬁcally for women farmers to boost their participation, taking into account the challenges they face, such as domestic duties, travel distances, convenient timings (mostly night) and reasonable duration (45 minutes). ● Expand the scale of demonstrations to include a broader group of farmers so that they are more beneﬁcial and inclusive. ● Incorporate more audiovisual tools into training sessions to improve farmers&amp;#x27; comprehension and retention. ● Simpliﬁcation of data collection and documentation processes so that PUMs can easily input data into the Better Cotton-mandated sheets; thereby bringing in efﬁciency so that the same time could be used for capacity building activities. ● Facilitate provision of irrigation facilities and guidance on irrigation. Male and Female Program farmers, Lead farmers, Non-program and Co-farmers ● Farmers mentioned they would appreciate receiving high-quality seeds or a subsidy for them. ● Program farmers suggested having more season wise trainings, but at a time convenient to them. ● Farmers requested to provide free PPE kits, as the cost of ₹ 1000 per kit is burdensome for them. ● To provide small scale farmers with cotton storage bags, who often struggle to afford these materials. While larger farmers can purchase storage supplies, small farmers would beneﬁt from receiving high-quality storage bags. 6 --- Page 8 --- ● The female program farmers spoke of their preference for separate women-only meetings rather than mixed meetings. They cited uneasiness and uncomfort with male participants who are usually intoxicated by the evening. ● Non program farmers mentioned they would like to attend Better Cotton meetings provided they are held at a convenient time. Third party veriﬁers, Assurance coordinator ● Data shared by Better Cotton staff, before the licensing assessment with the 3PVs, should encompass broader information rather than being limited to the speciﬁc PU. This will help them understand the PUs better and conduct detailed in-depth reviews. MEL coordinator ● Need to exercise caution in sampling of lead farmers. Non-random sampling of lead farmers, unlike Better Cotton farmers, introduces bias in the comparisons between Lead farmers, Better Cotton farmers, and non-Better Cotton farmers. Better Cotton-registere d Ginner ● Aggregation and sale of Better Cotton in large quantities by the farmers might go a long way in ensuring separate processing and higher uptake of Better Cotton in the supply chain. Evaluation team ● Recommend using the RCEEIS (Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efﬁciency, Impact and Sustainability) evaluation criteria at the endline to holistically gauge the attainment of project outcomes and strategies to scale up. 7 --- Page 9 --- 1. Introduction 1.1. Background of the PURE project Better Cotton stands as the globe&amp;#x27;s foremost cotton sustainability initiative. Its mission is to help &amp;#x27;cotton communities survive and thrive, while protecting and restoring the environment’. Better Cotton seeks to transform cotton production worldwide by promoting more sustainable farming practices, improving livelihoods, and ensuring the long-term health of farming communities and the environment. The innovative pilot project called - the &amp;#x27;Producer Unit Rescoping&amp;#x27; (PURE) pilot aims to try out a new, geographic approach to implementing the Better Cotton Standard System to improve efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability of the program by supporting more holistic, community-based approaches - especially around the six principles of Better Cotton, namely, Management, Natural Resources, Crop Protection, Fibre Quality, Decent Work, and Sustainable Livelihoods. Replacing the prevailing method that centers solely on speciﬁed (typically male) farmers on a designated list, PURE broadens its scope to encompass all farming households within a deﬁned geographic unit in the Better Cotton program. The project envisages improving the efﬁciency and scalability of Better Cotton, by reducing data and administration efforts associated with farmer lists or other data related processes, and using alternate methods to monitor implementation (such as periodic baseline studies, GIS and government data, gin procurement volumes, and other secondary sources). The pilot aims to support Better Cotton’s overall goal towards traceability by facilitating stronger farm-to-gin traceability and eliminating the need to segregate cotton from individual farms. 1.2. Objectives of the Program The objectives of the producer unit rescoping pilot are as follows - ● Enhance capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. ● Improve efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. ● Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms. 1.3. Scope of work The scope of the evaluation covers a baseline study (for answering the key evaluation questions, thereby validating the project assumptions and benchmarking the project key performance indicators at the baseline) for the 3 Producer Units to be rescoped, conducted in collaboration with the Better Cotton team and the Programme Partner WWF (Telangana). 8 --- Page 10 --- Figure No. 1 - Location of the 3PUs to be rescoped in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of Telangana 1 . For the pilot project, the 3 producer units of INTL01, INTL02 (both PUs were established in 2012-13 and are considered comparatively mature PUs) and INTL23 (established in 2018-19 and is considered as comparatively newer PU for this study) covering most of Karim Nagar district and some parts of Warangal district in Telangana are being rescoped to form 1 large producer unit. The rescoped producer unit is expected to cater to a larger number of farmers (~10,000 per PU in contrast to ~3000 per PU initially) and cover a larger geographical area (~5000 hectares). 1 Image source - as shared by Better Cotton Team 9 --- Page 11 --- 2.

Objectives and KPIs of the Evaluation Given the context of the program, the overall objective of the evaluation is to: ● Evaluate the project outcomes (using its key performance indicators 2 ) against its pre-deﬁned objectives* as given below: ○ Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact ■ Time spent on data and administrative tasks by ﬁeld staff vs. time spent on impact driven capacity strengthening. ○ Increased reach with similar project costs: ■ Number of members of farming community trained and/or participating in Better Cotton activities, disaggregated by gender ■ Women having access to activities and beneﬁts within the Better Cotton System through the pilot ■ Women attending scheduled training sessions or workshops ○ Increased scope with similar project costs: ■ Area of cotton cropland covered under one single management system ■ Volume of cotton eligible for Better Cotton licensing covered under one management system ○ Increased Conﬁdence and efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: ■ Robust assurance approach that people have conﬁdence in ■ Relevant MEL data that can be used with other global MEL data, and that provides credible, high- quality data ■ Capacity strengthening approaches that accelerate knowledge, attitude, practice adoption among farming communities ■ Supply chain credibility and trust related to claimed volumes (*The scope of this evaluation is limited to monitoring the values of the indicators for the above objectives at the baseline only.) ● Validate the program statements that the intervention seeks to address; thus verifying the key assumptions on which the program theory of Change rests. 2.2. Research design A meticulous and sequential approach was followed throughout the execution of the assignment - right from reviewing the project documents to tool development, ﬁeld work, analysis and reporting. The approach followed to execute the study is described below - a) Desk Review Review of the Theory of Change and other program documents - The study commenced with a thorough review of the program documents aimed at understanding the traditional system of program implementation as well as the new rescoped approach that is going to be rolled out on a pilot basis. 2 Detailed list of KPIs mentioned in the section on the analytical framework 10 --- Page 12 --- Pre-ﬁeld assessment workshops - Multiple discussions were held with the Better Cotton team and WWF (Telangana) teams to understand the Better Cotton verticals of Assurance, MEL, Capacity Strengthening and Supply Chain, be cognizant of the nuances associated with the work that Better Cotton engages in with the cotton farmers on the ground and get clarity on the objectives of the PU rescoping approach and evaluation. The project KPIs along with their interpretations and implications were understood in depth so that appropriate tools could be designed to measure the KPIs. The list of documents reviewed and names of Better Cotton staff spoken to in order to understand the intervention better are mentioned in the annexure 5.1 and 5.2 respectively. b) Tool design and development Qualitative and quantitative survey and interview tools were developed by the CMS team in thorough consultation with the Better Cotton team before being ﬁnalized and deployed on the ﬁeld. The quantitative survey was digitized on the SurveyCTO platform in English and in Telugu. Qualiﬁed enumerators and moderators were hired to administer the CAPI tool and facilitate the qualitative interactions respectively. Detailed qualitative guides were developed to facilitate semi-structured conversations with stakeholders on most of the project key performance indicators such as on reduction in data and administration efforts, increase in women participation, increase in Better Cotton volumes eligible for licensing, and the supporting activities such as monitoring, evaluation, assurance and supply chain. While the quantitative tool helped get information on the awareness and adoption of better cotton practices followed by the farmers, the qualitative tools captured the perceptions of the stakeholders on the aforementioned KPIs, and the causal relationships underlying their perceptions. Data on the reach of the program, area of production, yield etc was collected from the secondary sources of information readily available with the program team. Links to all the tools developed and used have been provided in annexure 5.3. c) Sampling Quantitative surveys were conducted with the sampled PU farmers as per the sampling strategy described below. Information was captured qualitatively using Focus Group Discussions with the farmers and conducting key informant interviews with staff from the program team, representatives from the community and the ginner. A sample size of 120 3 farmers with a 5% buffer (for the quantitative surveys) was worked out considering a Conﬁdence Level of 90%, Margin of Error of 7.5%, Population Proportion of 50% and Population size of 10,000. Factors of heterogeneity in the population such as type of PU, block, village, land size and irrigation pattern were considered to identify and arrive at the ﬁnal sample using multi-stage and proportional quota sampling techniques. 3 A conﬁdence level of 90% and margin of error of 7.5% was considered to be appropriate for determining the sample size, given that information only on the knowledge, attitude and practices of the farmers was captured from the quantitative tool whereas data on the reach and outcomes of the program was available from secondary data sources. 11 --- Page 13 --- For the quantitative interviews, we spoke to Better Cotton program farmers, belonging to the following blocks and producer units. Post cleaning of the data, the ﬁnal sample used for analysis was of 121 respondents. Block/PU INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 Total Saidapur 8 0 0 8 Chigurumamidi 13 0 0 13 Huzurabad 9 0 0 9 Bheemadevarapally 12 0 0 12 Elkathurthi 0 16 0 16 Ellanthakunta 0 8 0 8 Jammikunta 0 8 0 8 Kamalapur 0 8 0 8 Gangadhara 0 0 16 16 Julapally 0 0 7 7 Karimnagar 0 0 8 8 Ramadugu 0 0 8 8 Total Quantitative Interviews 42 40 39 121 Table No. 1 - Quantitative survey sample For the Qualitative interviews, care was taken to ensure that there is minimal overlap with the villages covered in the quantitative interviews. We also made sure to gather diverse perspectives across the three PUs by speaking to stakeholders from the mature and the relatively newer PUs. The list of stakeholders interviewed for the qualitative study, along with the number of interviews conducted and data collection methods used is given in the table below. Sr. No. Stakeholder Data Collection method No of interviews 1 Program Partner/Project Coordinator KII 1 2 PU Manager KII 3 3 Field facilitator KII 4 4 Program farmers (Male) FGD 4 2 5 Program farmers (Female) FGD 2 6 Non-Program farmers (Female) FGD 2 7 Co-farmers (Female) FGD 2 4 Each FGD constituted of 7-10 participants 12 --- Page 14 --- Sr. No. Stakeholder Data Collection method No of interviews 9 Lead farmer KII 2 10 Ginner KII 1 11 Third-party veriﬁer KII 1 12 Better Cotton staff KII 3 Total Qualitative Interviews 23 Table No. 2 - Qualitative survey sample A complete list of names of the stakeholders interviewed by village, gender and designation is mentioned in annexure 5.4. d) Data Collection and Management For ﬁeld data collection in Telangana, CMS deployed an experienced set of ﬁeld researchers with domain experience within the pool of trained and ethical certiﬁed enumerators from the Community Engagement unit. This team was managed by ﬁeld coordinators and the Field Manager of the South Zone. A total of 6 enumerators (male), 1 supervisor (female) and 2 moderators were employed for this activity. 2 researchers from the CMS research team were also an integral part of the data collection team and were present on the ﬁeld for the entire data collection process, closely engaging in all the qualitative interactions. The ﬁeld teams were trained on the survey and the qualitative tools with the help of translators by the core research team with the assistance from the Field Manager. A training session was conducted at the ﬁeld location and covered the following topics: background of the project, objective of the baseline study, induction to SurveyCTO, protocol to administer the questionnaire, questionnaire ﬂow and data entry dos and don&amp;#x27;ts. After the training, we conducted pilot surveys at a couple of locations with active assistance from the core research team to identify issues if any and incorporate the feedback received to the ﬁnal tool. Utmost care was taken to ensure the presence of researchers sensitized to conducting interviews with female respondents while leading qualitative interactions with either individual or group of female respondents. Both the KIIs and FGDs were conducted at a time and place convenient for the respondents. The WWF team, along with the PUM and FFs assisted CMS in planning the village visits, as they had a better understanding of the proximity between sampled villages and respondent’s time preferences. This enabled CMS to conduct interviews efﬁciently, scheduling them back-to-back and minimizing wastage of time. Throughout the data collection period, the research team coordinated with the ﬁeld team to understand any issues faced in data collection and worked to resolve them shortly after. e) Timeline of Data Collection The baseline data collection started on 10th July 2024 and was completed by 17th July 2024. 13 --- Page 15 --- f) Challenges faced during data collection Despite the support provided by the WWF ﬁeld team in planning the ﬁeldwork and mobilizing the respondents, some challenges were encountered during data collection. These included difﬁculties in ﬁnding women respondents for the quantitative surveys (as per the sampling requirements) and challenges posed due to language constraints. While the local enumerators recruited by CMS were well-versed with the language and communicated smoothly with the respondents, the language constraints were particularly faced by CMS researchers who do not understand the local language. However, the enumerators took care to translate and explain the points being discussed in the interactions to the researchers at the time of the interview. 3. Study Findings 3. 1. Analytical Framework The overall KPIs of the project can broadly be divided into 2 categories. There are 3 overall project KPIs primarily designed to understand if the PU rescoping project was successful in achieving its speciﬁc targets and it can be scaled up without necessarily adding to the project costs. The 3 main KPIs are - 1. KPI 1 - Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact: ● Time spent on data and administrative tasks by ﬁeld staff vs. time spent on impact driven capacity strengthening. 2. KPI 2 - Increased reach with similar project costs: ● Number of members of farming community trained and/or participating in Better Cotton activities, disaggregated by gender ● Women having access to activities and beneﬁts within the Better Cotton System through the pilot ● Women attending scheduled training sessions or workshops 3. KPI 3 - Increased scope with similar project costs: ● Area of cotton cropland covered under one single management system ● Volume of cotton eligible for Better Cotton licensing covered under one management system Along with the main project KPIs, speciﬁc KPIs related to four verticals that Better Cotton works in such as Assurance, MEL, capacity strengthening and supply chain/ﬁrst mile traceability have also been identiﬁed so that changes brought into these components can effectively aid and fulﬁll the requirements of the new PU rescoping approach. 4. Increased conﬁdence and efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: ● KPI 4 - Robust assurance approach that people have conﬁdence in ● KPI 5 - Relevant MEL data that can be used with other global MEL data, and that provides credible, high- quality data ● KPI 6 - Capacity strengthening approaches that accelerate knowledge, attitude, practice adoption among farming communities ● KPI 7 - Supply chain credibility and trust related to claimed volumes 14 --- Page 16 --- The analytical framework utilized in the baseline evaluation of the PU rescoping project tries to establish the baseline measurements (qualitative and quantitative) of all the 7 project KPIs while also trying to validate and substantiate the problem statements outlined in the PU rescoping intervention so that these can be used to compare the values of the KPIs at the endline for effectively determining the achievement of project outcomes. Delineating the underlying assumptions and risks that accompany the execution of the intervention has also been prioritized, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of both the opportunities and challenges associated with implementation of the project. The framework represented below depicts the analytical lens used in the baseline evaluation of the PU rescoping pilot project. The overall project and supporting KPIs have been slightly restructured to appropriately highlight the pathways of change leading to the ﬁnal project objective. Figure No. 2 - Analytical framework for baseline 3.2. Analysis and Inferences Following from the analytical framework, ﬁndings from each of the KPIs have been described in detail in this section 5 . i) KPI 1 - Improving efﬁciencies to drive impact: KPI 1: Time spent on data and administrative tasks by ﬁeld staff vs. time spent on impact driven capacity strengthening. At the endline, this KPI is designed to measure how effectively ﬁeld staff, including Field Facilitators (FFs), Producer Unit Managers (PUMs), and the Project Coordinator, are transitioning from data entry and administrative tasks to more impactful activities, such as capacity strengthening and farmer demonstrations. By reallocating time towards these meaningful interactions that fosters a 5 Based on the framework used, the inferences have been described in the following order - KPI 1, KPI 2, KPI 6, KPI 3, KPI 4, KPI 5 and KPI 7. 15 --- Page 17 --- deeper sense of job satisfaction, it is expected that the ﬁeld team can signiﬁcantly enhance their on-ground work, which is crucial for engaging with more FHHs, particularly women, to join the Better Cotton program. At the baseline, this KPI will benchmark the values of the indicator at the baseline and ﬁnd evidence to establish the assumptions underlying the KPI. 16 --- Page 18 --- Activity Field Facilitators Producer Unit Manager PC INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 Satish Administration 6 30% 20% 30% 10% 10% 5% 7 20% Data 8 40% 30% 40%-45% 60% 9 50% 60% 25-30% Capacity Strengthening 10 30% 50% 25%-30% 30% 40% 35% 45 to 50% Remarks - RIR reporting is time-consuming due to multiple revisions. - More efﬁcient to use a customized data collection device. -Excessive data work causes shoulder and eye pain. -Want to spend more time interacting directly with farmers. -Transferring well monitoring data (on groundwater levels) to Google Sheets is unproductive. - Emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring to ensure that farmers do not revert to old farming practices. - Work on cross-checking and removing duplicates is laborious. - Farmers eager to learn and apply new farming techniques. - Want to spend more time training farmers, but data consolidation work takes time. - Having a dedicated tech-based application for data collection may be useful so FFs can directly feed data into a device. - Complex data work hinders focus on ﬁeld training. - Fieldwork provides better insight into farmers&amp;#x27; issues. - Engaging with farmers is more impactful than data tasks. - Reducing data burden on PUMs and FFs is essential. Table No. 3: Percentage time spent on tasks by ﬁeld staff 10 Capacity strengthening refers to Training &amp;amp; CS activities, demonstrations, community level activities like rallies, AV shows, etc. 9 The PUM of INTL01 informed that 60% of her time goes into data related work like checking and updating farmers list. At the time of interview she was working on updating last years’ farmers list and entering farming data, well monitoring data (on groundwater levels) and compiling/cross-checking soil testing data. She said all these activities take up nearly 60% of her time. 8 Data refers to work on checking/updating data coming in from farmers list, attendance, training and CS activities, adoption Data, RIR &amp;amp; FFB etc 7 The PUM of INTL23 assumed the role of PUM only recently and mentioned that she is taking help from the PUM of INTL01 for most of the administration related work at present. Hence her time allocation for the said work is less. It should increase in the following months once she understands her role more clearly and is ready to assume more responsibility. 6 Administration includes work related to Human Resources, Finance, Accounts and Project Management. 17 --- Page 19 --- Field Facilitators (FFs) Field Facilitators are the direct link between the farmers and the ofﬁce staff. They are responsible for collecting some of the most crucial data mandated by Better Cotton. FFs are highly motivated and dedicated to their work and take personal interest in ensuring the welfare of the villages and farmers under their purview. I had the opportunity to reduce environmental pollution and help farmers strengthen their capacity, which also contributes to reducing soil pollution. These experiences motivated me to work as a FF. I am passionate about serving farmers and supporting their development, which has deeply inspired me in this role. I have been in this position for two years now.” - Field Facilitator of Allanthakunta (INTL02) FFs are broadly responsible for on-ﬁeld data collection, risk monitoring, for educating the farmers on the 6 Better Cotton principles and for helping them bring those into practice. Although both tasks are ongoing throughout the year, the workload for data collection and veriﬁcation intensiﬁes during the season, particularly when deadlines for speciﬁc Better Cotton-mandated data sheets approach. It is during such times that the FFs ﬁnd it difﬁcult to balance their data work and CS activities. As understood from ﬁeld interactions, the broad responsibilities of an FF are ● Help farmers ﬁll Farmer Field Books - FFs ensure that farmers are listing the correct information. Sometimes if FFs are unable to help the farmers, their fellow farmers or children help them. ● Collect data from farmers on various aspects mandated by Better Cotton - FFs are entrusted with doing the ground level data collection for lists such as the farmers list, adoption data and RIR. Although FFs do not directly input data into the RIR, WWF has provided them with simpliﬁed data collection sheets. These sheets make it easier for FFs to gather accurate information, which is then reviewed by the PUM and digitized for ofﬁcial use. Apart from the above mentioned lists, the FFs are also maintaining an LG attendance book. Farmers are mandated to sign the attendance book after every meeting. ● Capacity strengthening of Farmers - FFs, on an everyday basis, conduct CS training to educate the farmers on an array of topics like water management, biodiversity, soil health management, storage of cotton, ways to increase fertility of land, reduction in water pollution, etc. Nearly 20 to 30 farmers typically attend these training sessions. For those who are unable to participate, the FFs make personal visits to their homes or farms to ensure they are informed about the topics covered. Additionally, FFs follow up with these farmers by phone, encouraging them to attend the next training session. For these trainings, FFs carry communication material like ﬂexes, pamphlets, stickers, etc. Out of all the material aid, FFs believe that displaying ﬂexes is very impactful and helpful for the farmers to understand concepts easily. ● Community level activities like Rallies, AV shows, demos etc.- In addition to the CS training, FFs also arrange rallies, demonstrations, and AV shows for the farmers to help them understand the Better Cotton principles better. During the ﬁeld visits, it was found that these 18 --- Page 20 --- activities have a huge spillover effect on non program farmers as they tend to see or listen to the topics covered in these sessions. ● Monthly Action Plan (internal requirement by WWF, Telangana) - The FFs drafts and submits the monthly action plan on the 28th of every month to the respective PUM which consists of the challenges, suggestions, requirements and other feedback from the farmers on ﬁeld. The Action Plan is reviewed by the PUMs and APUMs to strategize the activities to be conducted in the respective PUs. The document also serves the purpose of ensuring a detailed brainstorming on the respective PUs with the on-ground experiences and perspectives of the FFs. Overall, FFs report spending nearly 30 to 45% on data related work, 20 to 30% on admin work and 25% to 50% on capacity strengthening of farmers. Time distribution of Work: FFs spend a signiﬁcant amount of time on data-related tasks, such as data entry and updating farmer lists. These tasks consume nearly 30 to 40% of their overall work time. They further lament that such extensive focus on data work often leads to physical discomfort, including shoulder and eye strain, and detracts the FFs from their ability to engage directly with farmers—a task they ﬁnd far more rewarding and impactful. I want to spend more time on training because excessive data work gives me shoulder and eye pain. I ﬁnd interacting with farmers more fruitful. Given an option I would like to reduce my data entry work” - Field Facilitator of INTL23 The FFs expressed a strong preference for reducing their data entry workload to allocate more time to capacity-strengthening activities, such as training farmers on sustainable agricultural practices. Besides aligning to their personal interests, FFs believe that these interactions provide immediate beneﬁts to farmers. For instance, the ﬁeld facilitator of INTL02 mentioned that he ﬁnds transferring well monitoring data from the ﬁeld to Google Sheets unnecessary. He suggested that this time could be better spent training farmers who cultivate crops like maize, paddy, and others along with cotton. Additionally, he also mentioned that the Farmers List collection and updation is a time consuming process which takes up almost 15 days annually to cover all the villages under him. FFs recognize the importance of data in monitoring and supporting their efforts, understanding that it plays a crucial role in assessing the local situation and tailoring their training sessions accordingly. Despite understanding this, FFs are eager to shift the balance, by spending less time on data tasks and more on direct, impactful engagement with the farming communities. Challenges faced by FFs: FFs encounter challenges with incorrect data and delays in data sharing, often requiring time-consuming follow-ups. These inaccuracies can compromise the quality of related data sheets, making the process particularly difﬁcult for the FFs to manage effectively. Suggestions by FF for Better Cotton: FF shared that they rely heavily on their mobile phone for nearly every task, including taking photos and sending them to the PUM daily. This constant use generates a large amount of data, which often causes their phone to lag or freeze. They suggested 19 --- Page 21 --- that it would be beneﬁcial if Better Cotton could provide them with tablets to better manage these tasks. Additionally, to boost female participation, FF thinks it is crucial to organize additional, separate meetings speciﬁcally for women farmers, addressing the challenges they encounter, such as domestic responsibilities and long travel distances. Moreover, incorporating more audiovisual tools into training sessions can signiﬁcantly improve farmers&amp;#x27; understanding and retention of the material. Producer Unit Managers (PUM) Each PU is assigned a manager (PUM) who is responsible for overseeing work done by the FFs and by virtue the farmers within their unit. Every PUM has an assistant PUM (APUM) who helps the former in ﬁeld visits, training, documentation, veriﬁcation and monitoring. The PUMs are primarily tasked with managing and compiling all the data that needs to be submitted to Better Cotton. In addition to their data responsibilities, PUMs also educate FFs on various topics to be taught to farmers, tailoring the content to the local context. PUMs daily spend half an hour to one hour with the FFs to understand the challenges they are facing (if any), their learnings, etc. PUMs regularly visit the ﬁelds to ensure that training sessions are conducted according to the prescribed format. They also address farmer queries and, when necessary, visit their farms. PUMs handle multiple lists at a time and have to strictly adhere to the timelines speciﬁed by Better Cotton. At any given point in the year, PUMs are working on some data. As the deadline for any data list approaches, the PUMs often ﬁnd themselves dedicating the majority of their time to completing it, sometimes at the expense of conducting farmer training sessions. PUMs mentioned that compiling all the data received (from the FFs), followed by cross checking and correcting duplicated data, is a laborious and complex task and has a direct effect on their ability to concentrate on farmer training. In a year, PUMs are mandated to conduct 6 farmer trainings per LG and conduct around 3 to 4 special activities like AVs, demos, etc. PUMs conduct training sessions as the farmers are curious to know about new methods (like PB Knot, Cremigel etc.) and implement it in their ﬁeld. When asked about the most impactful aspect of their work, PUMs highlighted their preference for training both farmers and FFs. They emphasized that FFs serve as a critical link between the farmers and the ofﬁce team, making their education essential for the overall success of the program. Apart from training the FFs and farmers, PUMs also provide special training to anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, healthcare workers, pesticides sprayers, school children etc on the relevant principles of Better Cotton. Apart from the data work and farmer and FF training, PUMs also do some level of administrative work like recruiting FFs. Overall, PUMs allocate 5% to 10% of their time to administrative tasks and 30% to 35% to capacity strengthening activities. However, the majority of their time, around 50%-60%, is consumed by data-related work. While FFs collect data from the ﬁeld, it is the responsibility of the PUMs to oversee the data collection process and check the validity of the reported data. At least 20% of the collected data is veriﬁed by the PUMs. While they recognize the importance of maintaining accurate data records as proof that farmers are adhering to program objectives, they expressed a preference for spending more time in the ﬁeld. They believe that reducing data entry tasks would not only increase their satisfaction and happiness but also enhance their ability to understand and address the challenges faced by farmers. 20 --- Page 22 --- At the PU level, no distinction was observed between the work done by the FFs and PUMs in the 3 PUs. Program staff in all locations were equally motivated and actively engaged in educating farmers and raising awareness about new and sustainable farming practices. Project Coordinator During our ﬁeld visit, we spoke to Satish Botla, a consultant for WWF India and the Project Coordinator for Better Cotton in the Karimnagar cluster. He handles a diverse set of responsibilities including both administrative and technical domains. On the administrative side, the project coordinator is involved in the collection and organization of data for project proposals and the submission of annual reports to Better Cotton. He regularly conducts ﬁeld visits, typically two to three times a week, to monitor project activities, review progress, and ensure compliance with project goals. His administrative duties also include staff recruitment and supervision, as well as conducting internal reviews where he discusses ﬁeld observations with PUMs. Additionally, he is responsible for cross-checking documents (like adoption data and RIR) to ensure their accuracy and completeness before they are submitted to Better Cotton or other stakeholders. He also oversees capacity-building efforts, planning and organizing training sessions for staff to enhance their skills and effectiveness. On the technical side, the project coordinator plays a key role in planning and conducting Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions for PUMs and FFs, ensuring they are well-equipped to educate farmers. He does not deliver any direct training to the farmers. He is responsible for developing training materials, including translating Better Cotton principles and other project-related content into the local language to make them more accessible. Satish also plans and implements training programs for PUMs and FFs, ensuring that the content is contextually relevant. His technical responsibilities extend to supporting Better Cotton licensing assessments, where he ensures that WWF’s implementation aligns with Better Cotton standards. He also develops and oversees corrective action plans as needed, reviews project activities, analyzes results, and establishes detailed monitoring protocols for various aspects of the project, such as FFBs and RIR. In his role, the project coordinator allocates approximately 20% of his time to administrative tasks. Data management, which includes overseeing the Farmers List, Attendance, Adoption, RIR, and FFBs, takes up 25-30% of his time. Training and capacity strengthening also consume 35% to 40% of his time, while demonstrations and community-level activities account for 5% - 10%. Greater emphasis should be placed on capacity building. We have an overwhelming amount of documentation in Better Cotton, with soft copies alone ﬁlling up 1 TB of storage. For years, I have consistently provided feedback, in the self-assessment reports, that the data burden on PUMs needs to be reduced, allowing them to focus more on ﬁeldwork.&amp;quot; - Project Coordinator, WWF (Telangana) Despite a signiﬁcant portion of his work being dedicated to data and capacity strengthening, the project coordinator believes that direct engagement with ﬁeldwork and capacity building is more beneﬁcial for farmers than data management . He has previously discussed with Better Cotton the 21 --- Page 23 --- excessive level of data collection required, noting that the data burden has decreased signiﬁcantly compared to previous years. Now, only 15% of farmers in a PU are required to maintain FFBs, with the rest participating voluntarily. Overall, his preference is to devote more time to training and ﬁeldwork rather than being overwhelmed by data tasks. There is a strong desire among FFs, PUM, and the Project Coordinator to allocate more time to impactful work, such as capacity building, rather than spending the majority of their time on data entry and administrative tasks. By focusing more on these meaningful activities, the FFs and PUMs can engage more closely with farmers, which will not only deepen the existing relationships but also attract greater interest from non-program farmers, encouraging them, especially women, to join the Better Cotton program. ii) KPI 2 - Increased reach with similar project costs: KPI 2 : a) Number of members of farming community trained and/or participating in Better Cotton activities, disaggregated by gender b) Women having access to activities and beneﬁts within the Better Cotton System through the pilot c) Women attending scheduled training sessions or workshops A snapshot of the perspectives of women program, non-program and co-farmers is given in the table below - 22 --- Page 24 --- PU Program farmers Co-farmers Non-program farmers Older PU (INTL01/ 02) - The most enjoyable part of the Better Cotton training is learning about the effects of harmful pesticides and opting for organic fertilizers and intercropping instead and also the exposure visits. - Agency of women to attend meetings and venture out of the house enhanced post joining the Better Cotton program, - Women use organic fertilizers, pheromone traps, neem oil. - Co-farmers enjoy one to one farmer training &amp;amp; ﬁeld visits over watching videos as it is more interactive in nature. - No discrimination with respect to the accessibility of training programmes was reported between program farmers and co-farmers. - Women learned the importance of wearing gloves, have switched from using urea to compost and neem oil after joining the Better Cotton program. - They have not been using cocktail chemicals since the last 3-4 years. - Farmers report lower input costs due to organic fertilizers, encouraged by FFs. - Since joining the Better Cotton program, women feel empowered with knowledge and ﬁnancial independence. - Children do not help on the farms as they prioritize their education and jobs. - Most women have not attended any Better Cotton trainings in the past - They use cocktails and other chemicals like Urea and DAP - Women eager to join the Better Cotton program to learn new techniques for improving their cotton crop quality but mentioned that the training has to be held at times convenient to them. - Women are not aware of pesticide costs, most of the farm work handled by their male counterparts Newer PU (INTL23) - Women claim not learning anything new from the Better Cotton training; the lengthy meetings are challenging for them due to household and agricultural responsibilities 11 . They suggest limiting the meetings to 30 minutes. - Women report the Better Cotton program - Co-farmers initially believed cotton couldn&amp;#x27;t thrive without pesticides, but since joining Better Cotton, they have switched from DAP urea to organic fertilizers, which has lead to increase in their yield - Farmers found the Better Cotton training useful as it helped them understand the importance of organic fertilizers &amp;amp; of PPE kits. - 2 of 8 farmers mention having attended a Better Cotton training, ﬁve to six times - Women eager to join the Better Cotton program to learn new techniques for improving their cotton crop quality but require the training to be held at times convenient to them. - Women expressed preference for separate 11 It was noted from the ﬁeld observations that women of INTL23 were inherently less motivated as compared to the other PUs. A prior disappointing experience in using organic methods may have caused their current disinterest, which is being reﬂected here. With respect to the ﬁeld trainings, the FFs of both the old and new PU seem equally motivated and eager to educate the farmers. 23 --- Page 25 --- PU Program farmers Co-farmers Non-program farmers not having any impact on their agency till now. - Women averse to using organic fertilizers due to bad past experiences where they got no results from using neem oil. - Despite attending meetings, 70% of co-farmers do not follow the recommended practices on the usage of pesticides due to reluctance in changing traditional approaches or other livelihood priorities. - Farmers ﬁnd farm exposure visits to be particularly useful. However, participation in rallies has been low, especially of women, due to household chores - Women engage in mutual discussions with their husbands regarding farming decisions, and they feel empowered to suggest changes, although not all suggestions are accepted. - Children help on farms occasionally when not at their schools. women-only meetings - Female farmers were not aware of pheromone traps - Women said that decisions, both of ﬁeld and household, are largely taken by their male counterparts Table No. 4 : PU-wise perspectives of women farmers (Program, Co-farmers and Non-Program) Socioeconomic and farm-level outcomes are much better from women program farmers from the older PUs as compared to program farmers from the newer PU; thus providing evidence for investment of higher capacity strengthening efforts of the ﬁeld staff towards working closely with farmers from the newer PU, giving handholding support so that knowledge and adoption of Better Cotton practices increases among this cohort of farmers and they are able to reap the beneﬁts from the same. 24 --- Page 26 --- Program farmers (female) Program farmers have been cultivating cotton for the past two decades, along with maize. FFs from both the established INTL01/02 and the newer INTL23 provide training on a wide range of topics. These include the use of biopesticides, proper handling and application of PPE kits, and the beneﬁts of using cow urine, cow dung, and neem oil. They also cover essential practices such as proper hand washing, precautions for pregnant women, addressing women’s health issues, preventing child labor, and techniques like intercropping and border cropping. All the women reported following the above practices diligently. Elaborating on the program’s reach towards women program farmers, it is important to note that women&amp;#x27;s participation as program farmers in the Better Cotton program is extremely low at present. Although a typical PU includes around 3000-3500 farmers, ~98% are men, with women making up only about ~2%-3% of the cohort. Field observations too pointed towards the fact that women participation was less and most of them were always occupied with domestic work such as cooking, cleaning or taking care of children. Interviews revealed that women struggle to balance household chores with farming responsibilities, with them naturally opting for the former. Of the 3529, 3524 and 3018 total farmers listed in each of the PUs INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23, the number of women farmers are 42, 7 and 81 respectively. These are graphically represented in the ﬁgure shown below - Figure No. 3: Percentage female program farmers in each PU The primary motivation for women to join the Better Cotton program was to enhance the quality of their crops and ﬁnancially support their households, alleviating the ﬁnancial burden on their husbands. Women receive full support from their family to do farming and in fact even take some farm decisions. It was observed that women of both the PUs (old and new) like attending training as the sessions are engaging. Women reported that they follow all the practices that are taught to them. Intercropping and border cropping is done by women of both of the PUs as well. 25 --- Page 27 --- When asked about the facilities provided during Better Cotton training, the women mentioned that they were provided with chairs, water, and access to toilets. Both husbands and wives could speak freely in the meetings, with FFs treating everyone equally and promptly addressing any questions. In one of the two program farmers&amp;#x27; FGDs conducted, the women from the older INTL02 group shared that they pass on the knowledge gained to other non-program farmers, which has helped them understand the importance of using organic pesticides. In the newer INTL23, women mentioned that they do not share or discuss any information learnt in the training with other non program farmers. They mentioned that when they try to share their knowledge with their husbands, they are often dismissed with the remark that the husbands already know. It is important to note that there was no difference observed in the capacity strengthening approach of INTL23 vis-a-vis the other PUs. Women of INTL23 seemed less motivated and not inclined to adopt sustainable farming practices due to a prior disappointing experience that they had with adoption of organic practices. Figure No. 4 - FGD with women program farmers, Bheempelli, INTL02 Farmers expressed a strong preference for their children not to pursue agriculture, citing its demanding and labor-intensive nature. However, there was a clear difference between the old and new PUs in terms of personal motivation to try out sustainable practices, soil testing, number of training/demonstrations conducted, effect of the program on women empowerment, and learnings from training. From the arguments listed below, it can be concluded that women from the newer PU, INTL23 require more training and handholding support for them to absorb the knowledge shared and implement those practices in their farms thus indicating the fact that the ﬁeld staff’s efforts towards capacity strengthening (especially of farmers newly joining the program) are necessary and required. ● In INTL02, women have shifted away from chemical pesticides, opting instead for neem oil, vermicompost, and avoiding the use of chemical cocktails . They are conscious of the detrimental effects chemicals have on both soil health and their own well-being. Previously, 26 --- Page 28 --- when they relied on chemicals like urea, DAP, and cocktails, their crops suffered damage. However, since joining the Better Cotton program, they have transitioned to organic fertilizers, leading to reduced input costs, increased yields, and consequently higher incomes. ● Conversely, while farmers in INTL23 also use organic fertilizers such as neem oil, navdhanya, and biopesticides, they continue to rely on chemicals like urea and potassium, including cocktails. Their past experiences with organic methods have been less favorable, resulting in low trust in these practices. For instance, women reported trying neem oil for pest control but did not achieve the desired results. ● Farmers of INTL02 reported that soil tests were done free of cost for them and the results, which came after 15 days, helped them decide which crops to grow. Conversely, farmers of INTL23 reported that no soil testing was done and they felt clueless about what to grow and which fertilizers to use. ● In both PUs, training sessions have been conducted on schedule, with women actively participating. In INTL23, three training sessions for women and two seasonal training sessions for men have been held as of July 2024, while in INTL02, 3 to 5 training sessions have taken place. However, in INTL23, no demonstrations or rallies have been organized for women, whereas men have attended demonstrations on intercropping, the use of navdhanya, and other practices. This may be because the women of INTL23 are only available in the evenings or at night when their household chores are done. In fact, they have suggested scheduling training during these times to better accommodate their availability. ● Women of INTL02 reported that after being part of the Better Cotton program, husbands have been more open about women attending training sessions or venturing outside the house whereas in INTL23 women saw no such differences in agency. ● When program farmers were asked to rate the extent to which the training sessions contributed to their knowledge and awareness, farmers from INTL02 12 rated it as ‘Medium.’ They mentioned that they enjoy attending the trainings and appreciate the interactive format, which keeps them engaged. In contrast, farmers from INTL23 rated the impact as ‘Low,’ expressing that the sessions do not offer any new or signiﬁcant information. They also found the meetings to be lengthy and time-consuming, making it difﬁcult for them to stay for the entire duration due to their responsibilities at home and in the ﬁelds. They suggested shortening the meetings to around 30 minutes. Changes in Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) Related to Cotton Farming Farmers involved in the Better Cotton program have experienced changes in their knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to cotton farming. Women farmers of INTL02, have greatly reduced their use of heavy chemicals, recognizing the associated health risks. This awareness has led to an increase in both yield and crop quality, with market rates for their produce rising dramatically from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,800 per quintal before the program to Rs. 7,500 per quintal after joining. Women farmers of INTL23, too, use only ‘green color 13 ’ marked pesticides. The adoption of intercropping and border cropping, such as planting yellow gram, has become common practice among farmers, optimizing land use and improving crop diversity. Additionally, 13 Pesticides are classiﬁed by toxicity level using a color code, Red: Extremely toxic, Yellow: Highly toxic, Blue: Moderately toxic, Green: Less toxic. 12 Farmers were chosen either from INTL01 or 02 for this KPI. Program female farmers from Bheempelli village of INTL02 were randomly selected for this discussion. Respondents from INTL01 were not a part of this sample. 27 --- Page 29 --- they have started growing two crops annually—cotton and vegetables—allowing them to supplement their household diet and reduce expenses. A notable shift has been the increased adoption of PPE kits, reﬂecting a growing emphasis on health and safety, in both the PUs. This improved awareness both in terms of occupational safety and health (OSH) along with an increased yield as a result of adopting the program promoted approaches, have contributed to higher ﬁnancial returns for the farmers leading to an enhancement in their standard of living. Many women reported that they have been able to purchase items like TVs, refrigerators, bikes, and even tractors. However, this improvement in lifestyle was reported only by the INTL02 women farmers. Figure No. 5 - FGD with women program farmers, Bheempelli, INTL02 Women farmers of INTL02 are now making a proﬁt of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 30,000 per acre per season, with overall expenditures decreasing. Over the past ﬁve years, they have transitioned from using harmful pesticides like urea, DAP, and chemical cocktails to organic fertilizers, which has increased their income while reducing fertilizer costs. This comprehensive shift in farming practices demonstrates the impact of the Better Cotton program on their lives. Non-program farmers (female) Out of the two non program farmers FGD that were conducted - women from INTL01 mentioned that they have not attended any Better Cotton training in the past. While on the other hand two out of eight women of INTL23 mentioned that they have attended ﬁve to six Better Cotton trainings in the past. Women who could not attend cited reasons like either tending to household chores or training timings clashing with farm timings. Women farmers of both the PUs unanimously agreed that they would like to participate in the Better Cotton program provided the trainings are held at a convenient time. Currently the trainings are not held at a time when they are available and therefore they are not able to attend or show any interest. In addition, the women spoke of their preference for separate women-only meetings rather than mixed meetings. They cited uneasiness and uncomfort with male participants who are usually intoxicated by the evening. 28 --- Page 30 --- Women from both PUs (old and new) were aware of important practices, such as avoiding child labor, using PPE kits, adopting organic methods like applying sheep and cow dung, practicing intercropping and border cropping, and avoiding the use of &amp;#x27;red color&amp;#x27; coded (i.e. harmful) pesticides. However, they were unaware of pheromone traps and relied heavily on chemicals for their farms. When asked what they would like to learn from the Better Cotton program, they said that they are keen to learn new methods of growing cotton to get a good quality crop. However, clear differences between program and non-program farmers were evident. Non-program farmers admitted to using chemicals like urea, DAP, potassium, and chemical cocktails, while program farmers demonstrated awareness of the environmental harm caused by such pesticides. Additionally, non-program farmers were less familiar with practices like using pheromone traps. A signiﬁcant difference observed from a gender perspective was that non-program women farmers were less informed about farm activities, including the costs of pesticides, and indicated that decision-making was primarily handled by their husbands. In contrast, women who participated in the program demonstrated greater independence, actively participating in decision-making and being more involved in farm management. Overall, non-program women farmers explicitly expressed interest in being a part of the program, however with the condition that the meetings take place at a convenient time. Co-farmers (female) Farmers who are a part of the household of the program farmer (listed in the Better Cotton program) are called Co-farmers. At present, there are about 1691, 2327 and 3075 co-farmers from INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23 who have beneﬁted from the Better Cotton training program. Of these, about 1501, 2033, and 1975 co-farmers from each of the PUs are female. The percentage of female co-farmers reached by the Better Cotton program at present is shown in the graph below - Figure No. 6: Percentage female co-farmers in each PU 29 --- Page 31 --- Co-farmers of INTL02 reported that they enjoy attending the training sessions as it adds to their knowledge plus they get to interact with other farmers. A group of co-farmers informed that till date, they have learnt about safety and precautionary measures like using gloves, mask and as well as inter cropping and border cropping in the training. The co-farmers reported that they did not ﬁnd any difference in the way the FFs engaged with the program farmers and them in the training and also mentioned that the FFs are very proactive in addressing their queries. They informed that farmers are provided with chairs, and water during the training. Typically, both husband and wife attend the meetings, with time and travel distance being the key factors inﬂuencing their decision to attend the training. Co-farmers reported that whatever they learn in the meetings are shared with other non-program farmers 14 . The co farmers of INTL02 also reported that they enjoy ﬁeld visits more than audio visual shows, as the former is more interactive in nature. Figure No. 7 - FGD with Co-farmers, Sambyapalli, INTL23 The effectiveness of the training is evident in several key changes reported by the women: ● Before participating in the Better Cotton program, they were unaware of the importance of wearing gloves, a practice they have since adopted. ● The program also shifted their approach to farming, moving them away from using chemicals like urea to more sustainable alternatives such as compost and neem oil. They noted that they have not used chemical cocktails for the past 3-4 years, reﬂecting the long-term impact of the training . ● Additionally, the farmers have experienced a decrease in ﬁeld investment costs. They attribute these savings to the use of organic fertilizers, a practice strongly encouraged by the FFs, which has led to lower overall expenses compared to their practices before joining the Better Cotton program. 14 It was observed that generally women are the only ones who tend to share info with their male counterparts or other female farmers. In some PUs we saw the active participation of both male and females (especially in Bheempelli) - there was interaction between the two and they took decisions together. 30 --- Page 32 --- Over the past few years, there has been a noticeable increase in women’s participation in meetings. Previously, their husbands were reluctant to listen to their input, but the training has given these women a stronger voice and inﬂuence in decision-making. As their knowledge has grown, so has their authority and conﬁdence in expressing their opinions. This was reported by the farmers of both the PUs. Co-farmers of INTL02 reported gaining greater ﬁnancial independence; they now earn their own money and do not have to depend on their husbands for monetary assistance. This newfound autonomy has resulted from an increased participation of the women in various programs organized by Better Cotton, in self-help groups and focused attempts by the FF’s in engaging speciﬁcally with the Co-farmers towards enhancing their knowledge along with their socio-economic empowerment, has contributed to an overall sense of empowerment among the women. They particularly appreciated learning about intercropping and organic fertilizers, further reinforcing their active role in farming and decision-making. Co-farmers of INTL23 mentioned that they take help of children in the ﬁeld during holidays for simple ﬁeld tasks (not any hazardous activity) and that they ensure that it does not hinder their education. Thus, program farmers have found the Better Cotton training sessions highly impactful, actively applying what they learn to enhance their farming practices, with women particularly valuing the interactive and engaging nature of these sessions. Meanwhile, non-program farmers and co-farmers have shown a strong desire to join the Better Cotton program, eager to learn new methods for improving their crop quality. Many non-program farmers expressed that they would participate in the Better Cotton training sessions if they were held at more convenient times, highlighting their enthusiasm to gain new knowledge and practices. Co-farmers have also reported that they enjoy attending these sessions, appreciating both the knowledge gained and the opportunity to interact with other farmers. iii) KPI 6 - Increased efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: Capacity strengthening approaches KPI 6: Capacity Strengthening - Increase in number of farmers reached through Capacity Strengthening in PURE (as compared to PU); that accelerates knowledge, attitude and practices adoption in them. An overview of the perspectives of program farmers (male) from different producer units is listed in the table below - PU Older PU (INTL01/02) New PU (INTL23) Program farmers (male) - Beneﬁtted due to reduction in expenses and improvement in yield post making use of organic fertilizers as opposed to using chemical fertilizers previously. - FFBs maintained diligently by the farmers - FFB not maintained/updated by the farmers regularly - Reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals and increased adoption of safer practices like using green color pesticides instead of red . 31 --- Page 33 --- PU Older PU (INTL01/02) New PU (INTL23) - Mention audio visuals being the best medium for learning new concepts. - Farmers joining the Better Cotton program later were inspired by the progress of Better Cotton farmers using fewer pesticides and participating in rallies and AVs. - Quality of life of program farmers enhanced post joining the Better Cotton program. Farmers informed that they could purchase chairs for their home, educate their children and some could also convert their kutcha houses (non-durable) to pucca houses (strong and durable). - Female farmers rarely attend meetings due to household chores &amp;amp; decision making authority is majorly the male. - However, Better Cotton training has helped female farmers in gaining knowledge and hence, better decision making roles now. - Duration of meetings to be reduced to 45 minutes. - Farmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training tools and better safety materials. Table No. 5 : PU-wise perspectives of program farmers (Male) Program farmers (Male) Male farmers constitute the majority of the program farmers listed with the Better Cotton program at present. As shown below, of the total number of farmers about 98.81% from INTL01 (3497 farmers), 99.80% from INTL02 (3517 farmers) and 97.32% from INTL23 (2937 farmers) are male. Figure No. 8: Percentage male program farmers in each PU Effectiveness of trainings (male program farmers) Quantitative surveys conducted of 120 farmers from the 3 PUs helped showcase the effectiveness of training sessions and the subsequent change in knowledge, attitude and practices of the farmers. While farmers from the older PUs (INTL01 and INTL02) mentioned that they had attended 5 trainings on average in the last 1 year, farmers from the newer PU (INTL23) informed that they had attended 3 such trainings in the last season. When the sampled 42, 40 and 39 farmers from INTL01, 32 --- Page 34 --- 02 and 23 were enquired about the concepts that they learned in the training sessions, the majority indicated that they had learned about crop rotation, application of organic manures, conducting soil tests and installing traps in the trainings . Having been a part of the Better Cotton program for a longer duration, a higher percentage of farmers from the older producer units (INTL01 and 02) mentioned learning about more topics concerning sustainable cotton production as compared to farmers from the new PU (INTL23). The extent of adoption of practices is also relatively higher in the older PUs as compared to the new PU. This data corroborates the fact that a higher amount of effort is required in educating farmers newly inducted into the program so as to bring about a change in their levels of awareness, knowledge and adoption of practices as compared to the farmers who have been a part of the program since long. The percentage of farmers (from the sample surveyed and from secondary data on the population) reporting knowledge of key concepts and adoption of cotton farming practices respectively is mentioned in the table below - 33 --- Page 35 --- Concepts learned and practices adopted by PU INTL01 INTL02 INTL23 Sample (42) Population (1696) Sample (40) Population (1947) Sample (39) Population (1606) Crop Rotation 64.29% 68.75% 90.00% 61.33% 74.36% 56.16% Deep plowing once in 2-3 years 30.95% 63.74% 65.00% 62.56% 30.77% 69.49% Application of organic manures 83.33% 47.58% 92.50% 60.35% 71.79% 45.77% Trichoderma soil drenching 7.14% NA 10.00% NA 5.13% NA Refuge crops 28.57% 73.00% 40.00% 58.14% 15.38% 38.73% Border and trap crops 42.86% 52.77% 55.00% 54.60% 48.72% 41.16% Quality seed selection 45.24% 100% 45.00% 100.00% 28.21% 100.00% Foliar application of micronutrients 30.95% NA 50.00% NA 5.13% NA Inter crop with pulses 40.48% 31.31% 47.50% 38.11% 35.90% 31.57% Plough across the slope 40.48% 63.09% 30.00% 48.95% 17.95% 60.65% Soil test based fertilizers and nutrient application 57.14% 50.65% 65.00% 50.08% 53.85% 43.15% Top dressing of complex fertilizers 45.24% 58.02% 30.00% 45.61% 25.64% 43.40% Botanical leaf extractions 26.19% 30.84% 20.00% 49.05% 28.21% 38.23% Installation of traps 64.29% 30.48% 80.00% 40.63% 61.54% 32.69% Table No 6: Knowledge of practices (in sample) and adoption of practices (by population in 2022-23) by PU 15 15 Differences in knowledge and adoption rates of Better Cotton practices could also be attributed to chance and/or unintentional biases in sampling/ other data collection processes. 34 --- Page 36 --- Even while farmers across the 3 PUs indicate a similar trend in knowledge (from sample) and adoption (from population) rates for most sustainable cotton farming practices, showcasing that knowledge of practices does eventually translate into adoption, for some indicators like application of organic manures, installation of traps and crop rotation - the extent of adoption of practices seems to be lesser even though the knowledge of practices is there (indicating the necessity of sufﬁcient time required for behavioral change). However for some indicators, such as growing refuge crops, selecting quality seeds and plowing across the slope - the reported adoption of practices is higher than their knowledge. These anomalies could be due to chance or also due to unintended biases in sampling or interpretation of questions by the data collector/respondent. The farmers also revealed learning about topics such as proper fertilizer usage, the importance of wearing PPE kits, and avoiding harmful pesticides in the training sessions. Farmers from INTL01 unanimously agreed that videos are the most effective medium for learning new farming techniques and concepts. They also appreciated the fact that the training sessions are held at convenient locations and times. Farmers of INTL01 do not practice child labour as they want their children to focus on education. In contrast to the positive attitudes and practices of farmers from the older PU, farmers from INTL23 reported that they do not wear PPE kits regularly leading to health issues. Program farmers in INTL23 further stated that they are the primary decision-makers and consider the input of only those women they believe to be knowledgeable. They also acknowledged that the Better Cotton program has empowered female farmers, enhancing their knowledge and thereby increasing their inﬂuence in decision-making processes. Farmers who joined the Better Cotton program later shared that their decision was inﬂuenced by observing the progress of existing Better Cotton farmers, particularly in reducing pesticide use, as well as by the impactful rallies and videos. As a result, both co-farmers and other non-program farmers have become increasingly interested in joining the Better Cotton program. When asked why some non-program farmers remain uninterested, the farmers explained that they tend to have a rigid mindset and are generally resistant to joining any programs. More than 70% of the farmers surveyed from all the 3 PUs mentioned that they were happy with the quality of the training sessions. When asked about the aspects of the training that they like the most, farmers from the older PUs told of getting to learn new topics (94%), followed by the teaching approach of the facilitator (72%), handholding support provided in adoption of practices (61%) and going on exposure visits (91%). Responses of farmers from the new PU (INTL23) are about 10% points lower than the older PU farmers when enquired on the same aspects of training that they like. More than 70% farmers from all 3 PUs indicated that there are no such aspects of the training program that they dislike, however a smaller percentage of farmers did mention the duration of the sessions and strict adherence to program practices being a bit of an issue. Higher yield and improved quality of cotton were the main beneﬁts that about 86% and 57% farmers from the older PUs reported from being a part of the Better Cotton program as compared to 50% and 20% farmers from the newer PU. Further, more than 80% farmers from all the 3 PUs said that the opportunity to learn improved farming techniques, potential increase in income and improvement in soil health are 35 --- Page 37 --- the primary reasons that motivated them to join/ continue being a part of the Better Cotton programs. Figure No. 9 - FGD with male program farmers, Aarepally, INTL01 About 25% of the respondents from the 3 PUs stated that lack of time to attend the training (due to domestic and occupational chores) is a major challenge that they face in regularly attending the training sessions. Again, more than 85% farmers from the older PUs (INTL01 and 02) informed that they are able to grasp the information shared by the program staff, that they get opportunities to ask questions which the staff resolves successfully and that the facilitator gives equal attention to all participants. When questioned on the spillover effects, farmers from the older PUs spoke of better quality of soil and land health, better quality of harvest for other crops, increased knowledge, conﬁdence and thus enhancement of self-belief as the major positive outcomes that they have experienced. Responses to all these questions are slightly on the lower side for INTL23 respondents (as compared to INTL01 and 02), clearly indicating a higher need of training and facilitation support required by the participants from the newer PU. Differences between the two PUs were observed in terms of women participation in training and interest in maintaining FFBs. ● In INTL01, women&amp;#x27;s participation is notably low. Out of the 130 Better Cotton farmers in a village, only two to three are women with them primarily joining the program after the recent passing of their husbands. Despite this, these women actively engage in the training sessions and also participate in rallies. Participation of women in INTL23 is also low but they rarely attend meetings due to their commitments to domestic and agricultural work. ● Farmers of INTL01 showed a liking and interest towards maintaining FFBs. They ﬁll it diligently, either themselves or with the help of their children, and feel that it is useful to 36 --- Page 38 --- document their expenses. On the other hand, farmers of INTL23 mentioned that the majority of them do not maintain FFBs. Changes in Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) Related to Cotton Farming ● Previously, farmers relied heavily on Monocrotophos and a cocktail of harmful chemicals, spending substantial amounts on pesticides but achieving very poor crop yields. Through the guidance of the ﬁeld staff, they learned to not indulge in such hazardous practices. ● As a result, their costs have decreased, and crop yields have signiﬁcantly improved, leading to better prices in the market . While farmers once faced losses, the regular support and information from the program staff Ms. Damayanthi and Ms. Sony have enabled them to conduct soil tests. ● They have also started planting green grams and black grams as intercrops using organic fertilizers produced domestically , such as those made from neem trees. Previously, there was no guidance on these practices. Now, due to the impact of ﬁeld visits and meetings, farmers are using fewer pesticides, cultivating intercrops, and improving overall soil and plant health. ● Farmers of INTL01, reported that the quality of life for farmers has improved since joining the Better Cotton program —they have purchased chairs for their homes, educated their children, and upgraded their homes from Kaccha (non-durable) to Pakka (durable) houses. ● The use of machinery has also increased, reducing the need for manual labor. This includes the use of tractors, harvesting machines, and even cotton-removing machines. Farmers of both the PUs mentioned the need for free or subsidized PPE kits. Farmers from INTL23 have expressed a need for enhanced audio-visual training tools and improved safety materials . While there is overall satisfaction with the Better Cotton program, some farmers of INTL23 noted that not all recommended practices are consistently followed, such as the use of PPE kits. Perspectives of Lead Farmers The lead farmer is responsible for educating fellow farmers on various sustainable agricultural practices. This includes teaching about bio-pesticides (green and blue), stem applications, PPE kits, intercropping (with crops like red gram and green gram), pest management, and border crops. They advise against harmful pesticides like Monocrotophos and promote safer alternatives. The lead farmer also provides guidance on precautions related to water resources, the use of bio-fertilizers, and efﬁcient crop watering methods, such as alternating the watering of plant rows. Additionally, they emphasize safety measures, such as wearing gloves and masks during pesticide application, and demonstrate the use of pheromone traps. Both the lead farmers interviewed shared the common goal of wanting to educate their fellow farmers on best practices and ensuring that they also beneﬁt from lower investment costs and higher proﬁts, just like they did. 37 --- Page 39 --- Figure No. 10 - FF distributing Pamphlets to INTL01 farmers Out of their own interest, motivation and foresight in understanding the merit behind adoption of sustainable practices, the lead farmer 16 of INTL23 conducts ofﬁcial training sessions once a month and meets farmers as needed to address their doubts, often attending to their queries over the phone as well. The lead farmer further exclaimed that while rallies and audio-visual shows have been held, distributing pamphlets and displaying ﬂex boards during trainings have had the most signiﬁcant impact in educating farmers of sustainable cotton farming practices. In contrast, the lead farmer from INTL01 mentioned that demonstrations, rallies, and exposure visits have not yet been conducted, but there are plans to implement these activities in the future. Farmers from both the PUs expressed a liking towards maintaining FFBs as it helps them track their expenses and income. Interest of non program farmers in trainings Farmers are highly receptive to their lead farmers’ guidance and consistently follow their advice. In INTL23, even non-program farmers are actively participating in the training sessions and have expressed interest in joining the Better Cotton program, demonstrating its wider appeal and inﬂuence. Both lead farmers actively engage with non-program farmers, encouraging them to join, while farmers themselves often discuss the beneﬁts and drawbacks of new methods they have learned. However, the lead farmer from INTL02 noted that some farmers are hesitant to join the program due to concerns about attending numerous training sessions and dealing with extensive documentation requirements. Participation of women In both the villages, women were actively involved in farming activities such as watering, planting seeds, weeding, plucking crops, and assisting with pesticide spraying. Men typically handle more 16 The lead farmer does not get any remuneration for the work that he does in educating the other farmers. 38 --- Page 40 --- physically demanding tasks like plowing and spraying pesticides. The lead farmer of INTL02 mentioned that on his farm, there are around 20 farm workers, with women earning Rs. 500 per day and men earning Rs. 800 to 1,000 per day due to the more labor-intensive nature of their work. He stated that male and female workers are hired for doing different types of activities associated with cotton farming. Men are paid higher rates than women simply because the work they do is physically demanding or hazardous like carrying cotton bags, plowing the ﬁeld or spraying pesticides while women are generally involved in weeding and cotton plucking. These rates increase during peak seasons. Following are some of the challenges mentioned by lead farmer of INTL23: ● The biggest challenge they face is the pink bollworm, which signiﬁcantly impacts the quality of cotton. While using pheromone traps has helped somewhat, the problem persists as there is no effective pesticide available in the market to combat bollworms. ● The ﬂuctuating prices of cotton remain a major concern. ● The government usually provides red gram and green gram seeds free of cost, but it wasn’t done this time. Impact of the program Since joining the Better Cotton program, farmers (especially from the older PUs) mentioned that their yield per acre has increased noticeably. Previously, farmers focused solely on growing cotton throughout the year, but now, they have diversiﬁed their crops to include maize and yellow gram as border crops as well. This diversiﬁcation has not only boosted overall yields but has also allowed for intercropping of pulses. These pulses are used for household meals, leading to additional savings by reducing the need to purchase them from the market. Additional remarks on the social structure observed during trainings/meetings of the learning groups as inferred from interactions with the farmers and the ﬁeld staff have been mentioned in annexure 5.5 . iv) KPI 3 - Increased scope with similar project costs: KPI 3 - a) Area of cotton cropland covered under one single management system b) Volume of cotton eligible for Better Cotton licensing covered under one management system The area under cotton and volumes of cotton licensed, harvested and in the supply chain have undergone signiﬁcant changes in recent years. Data reviewed from secondary sources revealed the patterns of change in area and volumes of cotton over the years. As seen in the graph below, area under the cotton production (licensed for Better Cotton) has increased for all the PUs from 2021 to 2023 (except for a small drop in the cotton area for INTL01 from 2022 to 2023) which implies that the program farmers have been successful in bringing more of their land under sustainable cotton farming practices. On average, from 2021 to 2023, the area under cotton production has increased by 13.5% for INTL01, 7.5% for INTL02 and 16.5% for INTL23. 39 --- Page 41 --- Figure No. 11: Year-wise area under licensed Better Cotton production (Ha) by PU The volume of cotton harvested has also seen an overarching positive trend from 2021 to 2023. All the 3 PUs recorded a higher increase in cotton harvest (of cotton licensed under Better Cotton) from 2021 to 2022, with the harvest only slightly increasing from 2022 to 2023 for INTL02 and 23 and decreasing to some extent for INTL01. On average, from 2021 to 2023, the cotton production has increased by 6.65%, 8.15% and 14.58% for INTL01, 02 and 23 respectively. Actual MTs of cotton harvested for the 3 PUs from 2021 to 2023 is depicted in the graph below - Figure No. 12: Year-wise cotton harvested (MT) by PU 40 --- Page 42 --- Based on the MEL and assurance results, the Better Cotton team estimates and declares volumes of cotton that could be eligible for licensing and being taken up in the supply chain as ‘Better Cotton’. As represented in the graph below, the volume of cotton licensed as ‘Better Cotton’ also shows an increasing trend from 2021 to 2023. Since the amount of cotton eligible for licensing is decided based on the early season estimate, at times, the volume of licensed cotton is slightly higher than the actual amount of cotton harvested. However, similar to the cotton harvested, on average, the volume of licensed cotton has increased by 8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, 02 and 23 from 2021 to 2023 respectively. Figure No. 13: Year-wise volumes of cotton licensed (MT) by PU Of the cotton volumes licensed in 2021-22, about 86%, 75% and 97% from INTL01, 02 and 23 was actually absorbed in the supply chain by means of selling to a Better Cotton licensed ginner. However, no Better Cotton could be pushed into the supply chain in the years 2022-23 and 2023-24 as the program team has been encountering challenges with ginner registrations and had to deal with high administrative workloads for uploading uptake data in their dedicated portal. The year-wise uptake of licensed cotton in the supply chain is shown in the graph below. 41 --- Page 43 --- Figure No. 14: Year-wise uptake of licensed cotton in the supply chain (%) by PU On the whole, the cotton production landscape in the project area has seen signiﬁcant changes in recent years, with some farmers transitioning to paddy cultivation. This shift is largely due to the growing preference for mechanization, as cotton farming remains labor-intensive in comparison. Despite challenges, there has been a consistent overall increase in the area under cotton cultivation, as well as in the volumes harvested and licensed, with the exception of INTL01 during the 2022-23 period. This temporary decrease in INTL01 could likely be attributed to external factors. However, the positive trend in other regions highlights the resilience and adaptability of the farming communities, along with an increased number of farmer participation in the Better Cotton program. The increase in licensed cotton volumes over the years is a testament to the effectiveness of Better Cotton in optimizing resource utilization and ensuring sustainable practices. This is further expected to rise post-PU Rescoping as the amount of Better Cotton volume shall be fully accounted as against the current scenario wherein some Ginners spoke of having to mix the conventional cotton with the Better Cotton variant in the absence of the sufﬁcient volumes of Better Cotton . Owing to issues with ginner registrations and data entry, Better Cotton uptake in the supply chains has seen a drastic decline from 2021 to 2023 (with uptake being nil in 2022-23 and 2023-24). Resolution of such issues along with consideration of an entire geographic area as Better Cotton will ensure considerable increase in the overall quantity that ginners can easily segregate and process without having to mix it with conventional cotton. v) KPI 4 - Increased Conﬁdence of the rescoped approaches including: Assurance KPI4: Robust assurance approach that people have conﬁdence in In order to gauge the change in level of conﬁdence in assurance results at the endline (for the PU rescoping approach) necessitates understanding the assurance process at the baseline (for the traditional PUs) and inferring the level of conﬁdence that the assessors have in the process at 42 --- Page 44 --- present. To understand the assurance approach in detail, we spoke to WWF (Telangana) Staff including PUMs and project coordinator, the Assurance Coordinator at Better Cotton and a Third Party Veriﬁer. Assurance is a comprehensive process, taking place once every 3 years for each PU, aimed at verifying if PUs are complying with the Better Cotton standards of cotton production . It encompasses a range of activities, including licensing, assessments, and data veriﬁcation, to ensure that PUs adhere to the established principles and criteria. Under assurance there are data related compliance requirements in addition to the licensing of the PUs. These activities are generally time-bound to ensure timely compliance. ● Deﬁned Compliance Requirements: Within the assurance process, there are data related compliance requirements, for the various lists such as farmers list, adjusted ﬁgures, RIR, Self assessment and Practice adoption data . These requirements are integral to maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the data collected. ● Licensing : Assurance activities differ between new and existing PUs. For older PUs, an assessment visit is conducted before granting a license, which is typically valid for three years. Once the license is nearing expiration, Better Cotton conducts a re-assessment to renew it. ● Surveillance Assessment : This is conducted for PUs with an active license, particularly when there are changes in farmer participation or if a red ﬂag was raised during previous visits. The surveillance assessment ensures that the PU continues to comply with Better Cotton standards. The data received by the India Assurance team is checked for its quality. Each ﬁle is reviewed for proper formatting, correct units, and duplication. For different data sets, they have tailored data cleaning exercises. For instance, the RIR data is thoroughly checked by the MEL Global team, while the India Assurance team performs an initial review to catch any basic errors before their deeper analysis. The assurance team comprises two sets of assessors—one from Better Cotton and the other from third-party veriﬁers (3PVs). Currently, four organizations are empaneled as 3PVs, with assessors like Lalit leading a team of 4-5 people to conduct these assessments. PUs are notiﬁed one week in advance of an upcoming assessment. A template outlining the requirements is shared, and PUs are required to submit certain documents within three days before the assessment. The third-party veriﬁers are external entities brought in to ensure impartiality and objectivity in the veriﬁcation process. They conduct a thorough review and assessment of activities on the ground within a limited sample size, ensuring that the practices of the PU align with Better Cotton standards. They mainly conduct two types of audits - Licensing audits to assess whether PUs meet the criteria for licensing and Surveillance audits to assess risks and ensure that PUs continue to comply with Better Cotton standards over time. 43 --- Page 45 --- Figure No. 15 - Role of Better Cotton staff and Third Party Veriﬁers in the assurance process As shown in the ﬁgure above, the role of Better Cotton staff and 3PVs in the assessment process is largely the same, typically spanning a three-day exercise: ● Day 1: Opening Meeting ○ PUs provide an introduction or presentation. Better Cotton views PUMs as an effective and important point of contact between the farmers and them. If PUMs are educated, they will be able to pass the knowledge to FFs and ﬁnally to farmers. ○ Interviews with staff members are conducted. ○ Villages to be visited the following day are informed during this meeting. ● Day 2: Field Visits ○ Two LGs are visited, with at least ﬁve farmers interviewed from each LG. ○ Both farmers and ﬁeld workers are interviewed. ○ Villages for the third day&amp;#x27;s visit are announced on this day. ● Day 3: Final Visits and Closing Meeting ○ Morning: Visit one LG and interview ﬁve farmers. 44 --- Page 46 --- ○ While a minimum of three LGs must be interviewed throughout the assessment, there is ﬂexibility to interview more if necessary. ○ Post-lunch: Closing meeting with remarks. ○ No recommendations or feedback on the PU’s performance are provided during the meeting; all ﬁndings are included in the ﬁnal report. ● Reporting ○ After the assessment, a report is compiled and submitted to the India Assurance Team and the global assurance team. Licensing decisions are made by these teams. ○ 3PVs are required to submit their reports to the India Assurance Team as well. The Better Cotton staff and 3PVs conduct assessments separately, with a 60:40 ratio—60% of assessments are done by 3PVs, and 40% by Better Cotton staff. Better Cotton staff do not accompany the veriﬁers at all times, ensuring the independence of the third-party veriﬁcation process. Better Cotton supports veriﬁers with date coordination, Point of Contact (PoC) arrangements, and also provides training (annually 7 trainings) - both online and ofﬂine - to enhance the credibility of assessments. There are 64 indicators which the PU have to be compliant with, and non-compliance with even one of these indicators results in the loss of the license. It was understood that the license of INTL23 is pending while INTL01 and INTL02 have received their licenses in the past two years. Sampling Methodology and Challenges 17 Sampling is primarily used during Surveillance Assessments to ensure that a representative portion of Producer Units (PUs) is evaluated each year. The goal is to conﬁrm ongoing compliance with the Better Cotton Principles and Criteria (P&amp;amp;C) and to verify that any previous non-conformities have been resolved. Factors considered for calculating the Sample are: ● New Farmers: PUs with over 33% new farmers automatically receive a mandatory surveillance assessment. ● Non-Conformities: PUs that had a high rate of non-conformities in previous assessments are more likely to be selected for surveillance. ● Regional Balance: The sample aims to achieve a balanced distribution across different Programme Partners, Local Partners, and regions. ● Risk Factors: Information on speciﬁc risk factors, such as known sustainability issues or labor violations in a region, inﬂuences the sampling process. ● Size of the Sample: The total sample size for surveillance assessments is expected to cover around 5% of licensed Producers globally each year, although this may vary based on identiﬁed risks. Given the limited three-day timeframe for assessments, interviewing of 15 farmers is considered a fair sample size. To ensure the accuracy of their ﬁndings, the Better Cotton team also conduct Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and engage with local resources, such as pesticide shop owners and village leaders (sarpanch), to cross-check information. Therefore, the assessors claim that combination of 15 farmers, FGDs, and input from local resources provides a comprehensive and 17 Information source: Better Cotton Assurance Manual 45 --- Page 47 --- representative sample. When it comes to the 3PVs, Better Cotton provides them with a set of farmers, out of which they select 15 farmers using purposive sampling based on factors such as gender representation and geography, irrigation levels, etc to be surveyed for assurance purposes. The assurance team is experienced in communicating with farmers and familiar with the local geography, which facilitates the assessment process. The selection of LGs is done independently by the assessors, considering factors such as rain-fed farming practices, landholdings, gender, geographical distribution, and the response of FFs during the opening meeting. This approach helps prevent selection bias, while their objective interviewing techniques mitigate respondent bias. The scope of the assessment, including its duration and sample size, does impose some limitations on the assessors&amp;#x27; ability to cover all aspects thoroughly. However, if they ﬁnd that three LGs are insufﬁcient or if results are inconclusive, they have the ﬂexibility to expand the sample to include four or ﬁve LGs. The 3PVs encounter challenges when local partners fail to effectively execute their responsibilities and provide adequate support, resulting in delays and time constraints . This issue is particularly pronounced when the sample includes distant locations, such as villages more than 100 km apart, making it difﬁcult to thoroughly cross-check farmers&amp;#x27; lists and other data. Additionally, the 3PVs also ﬁnd three days insufﬁcient to conduct in-depth interviews. The 3PV further added that it would be helpful if data pertaining to PUs other than the one they are visiting is also shared with them so that they have a holistic understanding of the ﬁeld they are visiting. Currently, the narrow scope of data (shared for only the PU that they are visiting) makes cross-checking difﬁcult is what he said. It was also mentioned that there have been instances where disqualiﬁed PUs or LGs simply rebranded themselves while retaining the same farmers, complicating the veriﬁcation process more. When asked about the means of veriﬁcation used, the assurance coordinator Lalit stated that the FGDs and information from local resources help them to validate and triangulate their ﬁndings. Expectations of the Better Cotton team from assessors and support provided by Better Cotton The Better Cotton team expects assessors to clearly communicate all requirements to partners, ensuring they fully understand what is expected of them. Activities should be planned proactively, providing partners with sufﬁcient notice to prepare and submit the necessary information on time. Better Cotton places a strong emphasis on maintaining the quality of ﬁeld data, with thorough investigations conducted to ensure its accuracy and reliability. To ensure smoothness in the assurance processes, Better Cotton assurance team has a dedicated Relationship Management team. While the team has many more responsibilities, the one relevant to this project include maintaining close communication with WWF (Telangana), to ensure that partners receive the standard protocols necessary for compliance. While partners are given the ﬂexibility to design their own meetings and training calendars, they must adhere to the established principles. Risks Considered During Assessments To mitigate risks, the assurance team requests partners to provide them with suitable dates for assessments, as they previously encountered scheduling conﬂicts with local festivals. Recently, one PU informed them of stafﬁng issues, where all had been terminated, leading them to request an extension. In such cases, they evaluate the availability of key staff members. If a particular staff member is not crucial to the assessment, they proceed as planned. Additionally, weather conditions 46 --- Page 48 --- can affect the process, as farmers are often less willing to engage during unfavorable weather. These factors are carefully considered to ensure the effectiveness of the assessments. Before the assessment, 3PVs do a risk proﬁling, wherein they conduct interviews with three independent stakeholders who are not directly associated with the PU (e.g., KVK, Sarpanch, school teachers) without informing the PU. These interviews provide valuable insights into potential risks and issues, such as child labor, farmer suicides, and other sector-speciﬁc challenges, which helps them be better prepared for the assessment . Additionally, the 3PVs conduct daily cross-checks and data triangulation using secondary sources and historical data throughout the assessment process. This approach allows them to address and clarify any discrepancies in real-time during the assessment. Factors Contributing to Non-Compliance Among Farmers The assurance coordinator mentioned non-compliance was observed amongst few farmers of the PUs. He stated that several factors contribute to non-compliance among farmers. One signiﬁcant issue is the adoption of PPE kits, which they encourage for safety, but farmers often avoid using them because they feel uncomfortable using them in unfavorable weather conditions. Additionally, extension agents or pesticide vendors sometimes advise farmers to mix chemicals, leading to practices that go against the Better Cotton guidelines. Another challenge is the use of certain chemicals banned by Better Cotton, like monocrotophos, which farmers continue to use because they are inexpensive and readily available. To combat these issues, the assurance team have launched campaigns 18 aimed at discouraging such non-compliant behaviors and promoting safer, compliant practices. Level of Conﬁdence in Assurance Results While there are no signiﬁcant challenges in the assurance process beyond the risks previously mentioned, the remote locations of some LGs can make travel between farmer households time-consuming and logistically challenging, for both the 3PVs and Better Cotton assurance team. When asked about how the existing assurance systems and processes are designed to mitigate the risks associated with free riders and non-Better Cotton farmers, the Better Cotton assurance coordinator Lalit mentioned that given the resource constraints, it is not feasible to have comprehensive details on all farmers. As a result, the possibility of free riders cannot be entirely eliminated, even within the PURE framework. Although the objective of PURE is not to completely eliminate free riders but to minimize the risk—keeping it at the same level or reducing it compared to the current approach—the process requires ongoing monitoring and adaptive strategies to ensure that the framework remains effective in curbing free rider behavior without compromising the overall goals of the program. Despite these limitations, he stated that their assurance mechanisms strive to minimize the impact of such risks by implementing rigorous checks and balances, though the challenge of fully eliminating non-compliance persists. To summarize, the assurance coordinator has a high level of conﬁdence in all the processes related to assurance , as seen from the table below. The ‘level of conﬁdence’ is on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest. 18 In the discussion with the assurance coordinator, it was clearly stated that they have launched campaigns to discourage certain non-compliant behaviors of Better Cotton farmers. 47 --- Page 49 --- Processes Aspects Level of Conﬁdence Comments from assurance coordinator Pre Season Information Duration 3 Systems in place for verifying pre-season estimate is ‘good’ (Not a PU requirement—it’s at the program partner level, with a template provided to them. No impact on licensing. Sample size 3 Approach 3 Reporting 3 Early season estimate (farmers list) Duration 3 Entire list is not shared with the India Assurance team.

It does not have any implication on licensing - normative requirement. Sample size NA Approach 3 Reporting NA Licensing/ Surveillance Assessment Duration 3 Sample size is representative, as the LG selection is based on factors like rain-fed farming, landholdings, gender, geographical spread, and FF responses. Assessors handle LG selection to prevent selection bias, and objectivity is maintained to avoid respondent bias. Sample size 3 Approach 3 Reporting 3 CAP Closure Process Approach 2 It’s not very reliable due to limited probing; NCs provide training feedback, but we lack means to directly talk to farmers and cross-verify. Reporting 3 PUs report directly to them, and they simply acknowledge receipt without further reporting to Better Cotton. Table No 7: Level of Conﬁdence rating by assurance coordinator As understood from the Third Party Veriﬁer , the level of conﬁdence in the assurance process is ‘high’. Factors like the ability of the 3PV to choose the sample independently and the systematic approach of daily data triangulation 19 drives the conﬁdence of the third party veriﬁer. The sample size is considered robust, even though it may be small, the random selection approach provided by Better Cotton is viewed positively. 19 It was mentioned by the 3PV that veriﬁers carry out daily data triangulation, comparing and cross-referencing the new data with previous indicators. 48 --- Page 50 --- vi) KPI 5 - Increased Conﬁdence of the rescoped approaches including: MEL KPI 5: Relevant MEL data that can be used with other global MEL data, and that provides credible, high-quality data The MEL approach used in the traditional PU system and the level of conﬁdence that the stakeholders have in it would serve as the baseline for comparison with the MEL approach used in the rescoped PU and to determine the change in level of conﬁdence at the endline. To understand the MEL approach used for monitoring the traditional PUs, we spoke to the PUMs and Sonal Dhingra, the Senior Coordinator - Global MEL - Better Cotton. Role of Producer Unit Managers in MEL Once the data is collected from the ﬁeld by the FFs, it is the responsibility of the PUM to check and verify it before sharing it with the Better Cotton team. The following set of lists/data sets 20 are managed by the PUMs - ● Soil health assessments - Soil organic carbon levels are analyzed to determine if they have increased or decreased compared to the previous data. After FFs compile soil testing data, PUM converts it into a prescribed Better Cotton format and shares it with the project coordinator. ● Farmers List (early season estimates) - The PUM cross-checks this data by calling selected farmers to verify their information and identify any outliers. ● Annual Planning Data - This includes developing time-bound plans based on key issues collected by Field Facilitators (FFs). Each year, PUMs prepare an activity plan and a monitoring plan. ● List of pesticides - A list of pesticides used locally is maintained by the PUM ● List of disadvantaged individuals - Identiﬁes physically handicapped individuals for livelihood support and collaborates with government schemes. ● Identiﬁcation of degraded lands - PUMs manage data on degraded lands, including identiﬁcation and restoration plans. ● Attendance data - FFs maintain a diary for recording minutes for every training and meetings that they conduct with the learning groups. PUM cross checks if the minutes are recorded properly. ● Adoption data - Digitizing the data shared by FFs into excel sheets ● Farmer Field Books - Cross checking only when on ﬁeld visits ● RIR data - Collect RIR related data on internally developed excel sheets and then transfer them to Better Cotton mandated RIR data format. While speaking to the PUMs, it was understood that under MEL processes, cross-checking is a critical component that they are responsible for. For each document, a percentage of the data is reviewed to ensure accuracy. Typically, 10% to 20% of data from each FF is considered. For example, if an FF oversees four villages, 10% of data from each village is sampled and cross-checked by the PUM. The percentage of cross-checked data varies: 10%-20% for larger populations and 5%-10% for smaller ones, a standard set decided internally by WWF. Typically, the APUM checks 40% to 50% of data, the PUM checks 10%, and the project coordinator checks 3 to 20 The list of datasets mentioned here is managed by the PUM for internal MEL or project implementation activities, even though it may not necessarily be submitted to the Better Cotton MEL team. 49 --- Page 51 --- 5%. As per the PUMs, this rigorous process is reliable, as any identiﬁed issues are further cross-checked by the FF to ensure accuracy. The time spent on MEL activities, for PUMs, varies with the season. Currently, one of the PUM is focusing on preparing farmers&amp;#x27; lists, which takes about 1-2 weeks. Her workload will shift to other data sets as the season progresses. Figure No. 16 - Role of FF, APUM, PUM &amp;amp; PC in MEL process When asked about the challenges faced in execution of MEL responsibilities while the PUM of INTL01 mentioned that she faces no challenge, PUM of INTL23 mentioned that meeting strict deadlines is a signiﬁcant challenge, especially when farmers delay the provision of necessary data. This delay also makes it difﬁcult for FFs to collect data on time. However, these challenges do not impact the ﬁnal project outcomes. Additionally, there is an internal deadline set by the Project Coordinator, before the ofﬁcial Better Cotton project deadline, adding to the time management pressures. 50 --- Page 52 --- When asked about the efﬁciency of MEL systems in place, the PUM of INTL23 mentioned that it would be better if the PUMs checked 20 to 30% of data instead of the current practice of checking only 10%. However, she later added that since PUMs are burdened with data work, the percentage of cross-checks is kept lower for them. Overview of work done by the Senior Coordinator, Global MEL, Better Cotton The senior coordinator MEL along with another coordinator is essentially responsible for looking after two data sets - the Reach Data (covering area, number of farmers, and production) and the Result Indicators Report (RIR) data , which involves collecting data from sampled farmers to assess factors like water and pesticide usage (organic versus chemical etc). The senior coordinator receives the RIR data 12 weeks after harvest, after which she conducts a gap analysis to ensure completeness and validity of the data, checking for inconsistencies such as irrigated area exceeding cultivated area or missing pesticide details. If issues arise, partners are contacted for clariﬁcation. Data is recorded in a speciﬁc format, moving from FFB to the RIR, with potential issues ﬂagged during gap analysis. Following the gap analysis, an outlier check is done to identify data points that are signiﬁcantly different from the average values, for instance, the average cotton yield of each PU is compared to individual farm yields. Signiﬁcant discrepancies, such as a PU cotton yield of 135 kg/ha versus a farm yield of 1000 kg/ha, prompt further investigation, which may reveal either data errors or genuine issues. This process involves extensive coordination between country MEL, global MEL, and the partners. It was also mentioned that the senior coordinator handles - Cotton Cloud, a power BI dashboard that is developed in-house to keep a record of the how much chemicals/pesticides PUs have used, income variation across seasons, etc. The data ﬂow from farmers to the RIR involves changing hands multiple times: FFBs managed by FFs, oversight by PUMs and MEL personnel at the partner level, and ﬁnal aggregation by partners in internal Excel sheets before being entered into the Better Cotton mandated RIR excel sheet. PUMs typically complete the data collection and entry for RIR with assistance from FFs or MEL staff. Reporting Requirements Mandated by Better Cotton MEL for PUs ● Reach Data is broken down into multiple parts, including early season estimates and post-harvest estimates. While the former involves reporting on farmers expected to grow cotton, which is later updated to reﬂect actual ﬁgures in terms of area, production, and the ﬁnal number of farmers engaged (late estimate data), the latter is expected to capture outcomes from the season. ● RIR Data: The RIR data comprises three main sheets: Area and Production, Fertilizer Use and Pesticide Use. ● Training Data: Details of all the training sessions conducted during the season, including training descriptions, duration, attendance, and differentiation between training for farmers and workers. 51 --- Page 53 --- ● Contextual Information: Introduced three years ago, it includes questions at the PU level, such as whether water levels or costs were higher than the previous year. This contextual data helps explain anomalies or outliers in the other reports. These reports are essential for tracking the progress and compliance of PUs with Better Cotton standards. Timeliness of Data Reporting Generally, there are no signiﬁcant delays from the partner WWF, as the reporting deadline is three months after the harvest. WWF typically reports diligently and on time. However, when Better Cotton requests clariﬁcations, it often takes time for partners to respond. Despite this, the actual sharing of the RIR (Result Indicators Report) typically meets deadlines. Rectifying Data Collection and Entry Errors The senior coordinator also mentioned a common issue that many farmers within a PU face - they report the same yield, which raises concerns about accuracy. This could be due to guesstimating, but in some cases, it could be genuine, as nearby farmers experience the same climatic conditions and pest attacks. There’s also the challenge of units of land size conversion. Farmers often know their land size in bigha, but Better Cotton requires data in hectares (ha), leading to potential inaccuracies during conversion. Similarly, fertilizers are sometimes reported in milliliters (ML) rather than kilograms, causing further complications. Another issue that is reported is that small farmers not having weighing machines, do not always know how much cotton they have produced and sold. It is then recommended that FFs check sale receipts to ensure accurate reporting. Sampling Methodology &amp;amp; its representativeness Prior to COVID-19, the sampling methodology for selecting farmers included two types: Better Cotton farmers and Lead farmers, with every LG having one Lead farmer. The sampling approach involved using a 95% conﬁdence interval and a 5% margin of error. For a PU with around 3,500 farmers, this meant selecting 500 to 600 farmers, including all Lead farmers (100 to 125) and Better Cotton farmers. The methodology involved randomly selecting 10 LGs out of 100 for any given PU, and then choosing all farmers within those selected LGs, amounting to about 350 farmers. The remaining 90 LGs were used to select Lead farmers. The senior coordinator informed that this sampling approach, while focused on ensuring a representative analysis of LGs, had its ﬂaws. The unit of analysis was the PU, and while Better Cotton farmers were randomly selected, Lead farmers were not. This created a methodological ﬂaw, as comparisons between Lead farmers and Better Cotton farmers, as well as between Better Cotton farmers and non-Better Cotton farmers within the same PU were made . Despite these issues, only comparisons between Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton farmers were reported externally, as the sampling of Lead farmers was not random. Post COVID-19, the sampling methodology was adjusted. From 2020 to 2023, the sampling methodology mandated that the conﬁdence interval remain at 95%, but the margin of error be increased to 10%, reducing the effective sample size to 200 farmers per PU - 100 Lead farmers and 100 Better Cotton farmers . The new methodology involved randomly selecting 10 LGs, from which 9 Better Cotton farmers were randomly chosen, plus 1 Lead farmer from the remaining LGs, resulting in a total of 200 farmers. 52 --- Page 54 --- While 50% of the PUs continued with this same approach, for the remaining 50% another pilot was launched in 2023-24, which aimed at reducing the workload burden from FFs which meant reducing the FFB distribution and monitoring support to only 5 farmers each LG based on feedback that too much time was spent on this task. The adjustments made post COVID-19 have increased conﬁdence in the methodology, making it more representative. However, there is a suggestion that the selection of Lead farmers should have been scrapped altogether to further improve the MEL process. Lead farmers were not randomly selected, unlike Better Cotton farmers, which introduces bias in the comparisons between Lead farmers, Better Cotton farmers, and non-Better Cotton farmers. This non-random selection undermines the representativeness and reliability of the sampling process. Overall, she could only rate her conﬁdence in the MEL approach for the RIR data, as that is her primary area of responsibility. The ‘level of conﬁdence’ is on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest. MEL Processes Aspects Level of Conﬁdence Comments from Senior Coordinator, MEL RIR / Final Post Harvest Data Duration 3 She expressed conﬁdence in the duration Sample size 2.5 Post-COVID-19 adjustments have improved conﬁdence in the methodology, but there&amp;#x27;s a suggestion to eliminate Lead farmer selection to further enhance the MEL process. Approach 2.5 It is good enough compared to what Better Cotton was doing ﬁve years back Reporting 2.5 No comments Table No 8: Level of Conﬁdence rating by MEL senior coordinator When asked about the means of veriﬁcation, it was mentioned that the MEL team is currently under-resourced for conducting thorough veriﬁcations, indicating signiﬁcant room for improvement. Country workshops are being held to enhance collaboration with partners, which will help us establish stronger connections and improve our processes. vii) KPI 7 - Increased efﬁciencies of the rescoped approaches including: Supply chain KPI 7: Supply chain credibility and trust related to claimed volumes Strengthening the Supply Chain and Marketing Dynamics The marketing of Better Cotton has traditionally relied on a strong and grounded supply chain connection directly between farmers and the ginners, most of whom are Better Cotton registered. Although some disruptions have been noted, particularly due to the ﬂexibility that Better Cotton farmers have in choosing where to sell their cotton (depending on price or already established connections with local traders), the overall volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing have continued to rise. 53 --- Page 55 --- Over the years, Better Cotton has witnessed a steady and positive uptake across various regions, reﬂecting stability and growth in cotton production. This progress has been bolstered by the expansion of cotton ginning industries, particularly in areas like Jammikunta. According to Mukka Narayana, a seasoned ginner from Jammikunta, who has been in the cotton sector since 1997, the launch of the Technology Mission on Cotton in 2000 and its subsequent popularization in 2008, mechanized operations have become more prevalent, signiﬁcantly enhancing processing capacity and stabilizing cotton prices over time. These advancements have collectively contributed to a more resilient and efﬁcient cotton supply chain. Financial and Operational Constraints on Ginners According to the supply chain coordinator Robin, ginners face signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and operational constraints that impede their ability to fully comply with Better Cotton’s requirements to segregate and process the Better Cotton. The cost-intensive nature of maintaining separate facilities and processes for Better Cotton, combined with ﬂuctuating cotton prices, presents a considerable challenge . Ginners have highlighted the need for ﬁnancial support or subsidies from Better Cotton or other stakeholders to help mitigate these costs . Without such support, there is a risk that ginners may deprioritize the separation and processing of Better Cotton, potentially compromising the credibility of the supply chain. This risk is however expected to be mitigated after the PU Rescoping which is expected to allow the ginners to bulk the cotton from a geography as Better Cotton. Marketing and Distribution Complexities Farmers typically market their cotton through two primary channels: the Government Market Yard, which operates from 6 AM to 9 AM, or by directly transporting their produce to preferred ginning mills. In both scenarios, the transportation cost is borne by the farmer, a factor that sometimes prompts them to sell their cotton to private parties. However, transactions with private parties are fraught with risks, as payments are often made on credit, with only partial payments at the time of sale. This arrangement can lead to fraudulent activities, putting the farmers at a disadvantage. Despite the regulated environment of the government marketplace, where transactions involve approved agents, and the direct transport to ginners, where negotiations occur directly in between the farmer and the ginner, challenges persist. The decentralized and dispersed distribution network complicates the accumulation of sufﬁcient quantities of Better Cotton within a speciﬁc timeframe. As a result, ginners often mix conventional cotton with Better Cotton, which undermines the traceability and credibility of the supply chain. Inﬂuence of Local Market Dynamics Local market dynamics, including competition from conventional cotton buyers and the impact of government policies on cotton pricing, play a crucial role in shaping the decisions of both farmers and ginners. In many cases, these dynamics lead ginners to prioritize conventional cotton due to better immediate returns. This prioritization can undermine the separation and traceability of Better Cotton, affecting the overall integrity of the supply chain. Key Disruptors and Adaptations The program farmers interviewed also mentioned certain issues which affect their ability to cultivate cotton using sustainable practices and ensure its uptake in the Better Cotton supply chain. Their major areas of concern are listed below - 54 --- Page 56 --- A number of farmers have shifted from cotton to paddy due to irregular monsoons and the superior mechanization in the paddy cultivation” - FGD of Male Program Farmers, Chityalappali (INTL23) 1. Impact of Irregular Monsoons on Cotton Production: While the recent monsoon season brought challenges, particularly in terms of rainfall scarcity, the program&amp;#x27;s emphasis on sustainable farming practices has helped mitigate some of these impacts. Farmers have been equipped with techniques to better manage water resources, and have been trained on border croppings and inter croppings, leading to more stable yields despite adverse weather conditions. However, there have been multiple suggestions from farmers as well as Field Facilitators for an improved intervention on irrigation facilities from Better Cotton in terms of providing the necessary equipment and tools, as well as guidance for water management. 2. Shift Towards Mechanized Farming: The labor-intensive nature of cotton farming has driven some farmers to explore alternatives, such as paddy cultivation. With paddy cultivation becoming extremely machine driven, the farmers get ample amount of time for other activities as well. On the other hand, cotton being primarily labor driven increases the cost as well as the effort. 3. Disease and Pest Infestations: Pest-related challenges, such as locust infestations, have been a signiﬁcant concern. However, the program’s focus on integrated pest management and the use of resistant cotton varieties have played a crucial role in reducing the impact of these threats, thereby supporting the overall increase in licensed cotton volumes. The 3rd party veriﬁers spoke of the expected improvement in this aspect with the introduction of Rescoping, allowing the interventions to be conducted on a geographical area rather than on Better Cotton farmers alone. Challenges with Better Cotton Certiﬁcation and Compliance Better Cotton has established connections with approximately 250-270 ginners across the country, who are certiﬁed annually after participating in a mandatory one-day training session. These ginners are required to separate Better Cotton from conventional cotton during processing. However, Better Cotton’s policy of allowing farmers the ﬂexibility to choose when and where to sell their cotton has led to a dispersed distribution network. This situation creates challenges for ginners, who struggle to accumulate sufﬁcient quantities of Better Cotton variant at any given time, often resulting in the unintended mixing of conventional and Better Cotton. Additionally, some of the cotton ends up with ginners who are not registered with Better Cotton, leading to gaps in traceability and difﬁculties in accurately reporting the volumes collected. The dispersed nature of Better Cotton supply further complicates the ginners&amp;#x27; ability to process it separately, leading to logistical constraints and a lack of motivation among ginners to maintain their Better Cotton licenses. Without any additional incentives or support from Better Cotton, many ginners express reluctance in continuing with the program, further jeopardizing the integrity of the Better Cotton supply chain. The timing of cotton sales is often dictated by the farmers&amp;#x27; immediate ﬁnancial needs rather than the scientiﬁc consideration of storage. Farmers usually sell their cotton according to convenience, sometimes storing it for 6-8 months, which can degrade the quality of the cotton. This lack of 55 --- Page 57 --- adherence to scientiﬁc storage practices further complicates the supply chain and reduces the overall quality of the product reaching the market. Ginners also face signiﬁcant challenges in the current system to differentiate Better Cotton from conventional cotton . Since there is practically no major outward difference between the two varieties, ginners can only crosscheck the Better Cotton Farmers List as an evidence for the produced cotton to be considered as Better Cotton. Practically hence, the Better Cotton farmer can only put forth his certiﬁcation as a negotiating tool with the ginner; instances of Better Cotton farmers demanding high price have also been reported from the ginners which the ginner is reluctant to pay. Added to these, some conventional cotton growers remain resistant to adopting Better Cotton’s recommended practices. Many of these growers do not perceive signiﬁcant value in altering their established methods which they have been practicing for years, speciﬁcally as they already achieve satisfactory quality and yields with their current practices. This resistance to change poses additional challenges in expanding the uptake of Better Cotton within the supply chain. Figure No. 17 - Cotton Ginning Mill, Jammikunta Role of Supply Chain Coordinator Supply Chain Coordinator manages audits, reviews reports, and builds capacity, particularly within the ginning segment. This role involves overseeing capacity-building programs for ginners, ensuring compliance with CoC standards throughout the supply chain, from ginners to end manufacturers. These programs are typically held in August and September. Monitoring and audits are central to the role, with a focus on addressing ginners’ queries and providing technical assistance on the Better 56 --- Page 58 --- Cotton platform. The Better Cotton process includes onboarding ginners located within a 50 to 100 km radius of PUs to ensure proximity to farmers. Each ginner is assigned a unique code, and participation is free. However, the credibility of the system is challenged by the potential mixing of Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton during transportation and processing. To mitigate this, regular visits to ginners are conducted during the active season from September to March to enforce segregation standards. Traceability is crucial to the role, requiring ginners to maintain detailed records at the farmer level, including transportation methods, quantities purchased, and the source of the cotton—whether directly from farmers or through middlemen. Supporting documents, such as purchase slips, quantity slips, and transportation records, must be meticulously kept. A key challenge arises when ginners cannot dispatch separate vehicles for Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton, heightening the risk of mixing. To address this, segregation practices are emphasized during training sessions, and vehicle records are scrutinized during assessments to mitigate this risk. The supply chain is complex, involving multiple stages from ginners to traders, spinners, yarn producers, fabric manufacturers, and ﬁnally, brands. The Better Cotton platform records the quantity of cotton purchased but does not track pricing, which is negotiated between buyers and sellers. Once cotton is recorded on the Better Cotton platform, it enters the Better Cotton supply chain, though not all Better Cotton-produced cotton may end up in the value chain if sold elsewhere, posing a challenge to system credibility. Gaps between ginners and farmers, especially in regions like Tamil Nadu, where ginners have limited information about farmers, further complicate credibility. The uptake of Better Cotton often falls short of the expected AAV for each PU, leading to inconsistencies in reported volumes. While ginners maintain physical traceability, limitations arise as cotton moves further along the supply chain. The system employs two models for CoC: physical traceability and mass balance (MB). The physical model requires strict separation of Better Cotton and non-Better Cotton at every stage, though the risk of mixing remains. The MB model is more ﬂexible, using BCCUs (Better Cotton claim units) to represent the quantity of lint cotton sold. However, audits are conducted to ensure that these points are only transferred when there is an actual physical transaction, preserving the system’s credibility. Ginners’ Perspectives and Future Outlook Ginners have expressed optimism about the potential beneﬁts of a geographic rescoping approach, which is expected to facilitate better collectivization and easier categorization of cotton varieties. Such a system is expected to improve the efﬁciency of the supply chain by doing away with having to process Better Cotton and conventional cotton separately, thus addressing one of the major challenges faced by ginners at present. There is a strong case for adopting a more scientiﬁc approach to post-harvest management. Given that farmers often sell their produce based on convenience rather than scientiﬁc storage timings, promoting better storage practices and speciﬁc duration for sales could signiﬁcantly improve the quality of cotton and the overall efﬁciency of the supply chain . Ginners suggest that post-harvest marketing of Better Cotton should be collectivized, with assistance from Better Cotton to enhance both the farmers&amp;#x27; negotiating power as well as convenience for ginners in the market. Additionally, extending Better Cotton incentives to non-program farmers could motivate more growers to gradually adopt Better Cotton practices, thereby strengthening the supply chain and improving 57 --- Page 59 --- traceability. This is expected to be better addressed with the rescoping approach owing to the new approach’ focus on expanding its reach to all farmers within a geography. 58 --- Page 60 --- viii) Key Stakeholder inputs Stakeholder 1.

Limitations Certain limitations associated with the execution of the baseline study of the PU rescoping intervention are given below - a) While care has been taken to clearly outline and quantify wherever possible the qualitative interactions with all the stakeholders, the contextual and subjective nature of ﬁndings associated with qualitative outcomes could limit the effective comparison of the baseline ﬁndings with the endline. b) Perspectives of women farmers (though obtained qualitatively) could not be gathered from the quantitative surveys as it was extremely difﬁcult to locate women program farmers, given the low reach of the program towards women farmers at present. c) Given the context-speciﬁc nature of the intervention, it could prove challenging to prove the external validity of the study necessary for scaling of the initiative. *** 62 --- Page 64 --- 5.

Observations based on the social structure Caste as a social factor was observed to play a crucial role in the day to day activities of the learning groups such as meetings and trainings. It was reported during the qualitative interactions with farmers and FFs that separate seating arrangements are made, as per preexisting social hierarchy, for farmers coming from the different caste groups present in the village. The powerful castes took the front rows while the marginalized castes, speciﬁcally communities including the dalits, were given seats at the end. The FFs put forth this as a necessary arrangement so as to ensure that there’s no inﬁghting within the learning groups. At least in a few villages, the learning groups are at times, said to be constituted on the basis of caste. 21 Each FGD constituted of 7-10 participants 64</Content>

Women Participation ● Are under production, cotton volumes harvested and licensed showing overall positive trends over the years. ● On average, volume of licensed cotton has increased by 8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, 02 and 23 from 2021 to 2023 respectively. Key Findings of baseline evaluation --- Page 3 --- Background of PURE Project 3 The &amp;#x27; Producer Unit Rescoping&amp;#x27; (PURE) pilot aims to test a new, geographic approach to implementing the Better Cotton Standard System to improve efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability of the program by supporting more holistic, community-based approaches by rescoping 3PUs into 1 larger PU in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of T elangana . Better Cotton’s Producer Unit rescoping intervention has been designed with the 3-fold aim of (i) Enhancing capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. (ii) Improving efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. (iii) Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms. --- Page 4 --- KPI 1 15% reduction in effort (time) on data and administration by ﬁeld staff KPI 3 Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing, without an increase in project cost KPI 5 Change in conﬁdence level in MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning) data vs. traditional PU approach KPI 2 15% increase in women&amp;#x27;s participation in Better Cotton (BC) activities KPI 4 Change in conﬁdence level in assurance results vs. traditional PU approach KPI 7 Change in volume of Better Cotton in the supply chain, credibility, and traceability issues KPI 6 Change in farmers/workers reached through capacity strengthening, and improvement in knowledge, attitude, and practice adoption List of PURE Project Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Evaluate the project outcomes (at baseline) against its pre-deﬁned objectives &amp;amp; Validate program problem statements; thus verifying the key assumptions on which the program theory of Change rests.

    <Content>--- Page 1 --- 1 Baseline Evaluation of Better Cotton: Producer Unit Rescoping Pilot Key Findings Catalyst Management Services Cotton Farms in Chityalapally, Telangana --- Page 2 --- Efforts in Data Collection Program Effectiveness Better Cotton Harvest Supply Chain Credibility ● Field staff spend 30-45% of time on data collection, 20-30% on administration, and 25-50% on farmer capacity-building. ● Manual data collection and veriﬁcation are time-consuming, prompting a need for efﬁcient systems to allow more focus on farmer engagement. ● Only 2-3% of program farmers are women, with them struggling to balance household chores with farming responsibilities. ● There is strong interest from female co-farmers and non-program farmers, indicating the need for increased capacity-building efforts for women, especially in newer PUs. ● Older PUs (INTL01/02) show higher adoption of practices and satisfaction with training, while newer PUs (INTL 23) lag due to previous negative experiences. ● Major reasons for continued program participation include learning new topics, facilitator support, and exposure visits. ● Low procurement volumes make it challenging to segregate Better Cotton from conventional cotton, risking mixing during transportation and processing. ● Regular visits to ginners during peak season help enforce segregation standards. Women Participation ● Are under production, cotton volumes harvested and licensed showing overall positive trends over the years. ● On average, volume of licensed cotton has increased by 8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, 02 and 23 from 2021 to 2023 respectively. Key Findings of baseline evaluation --- Page 3 --- Background of PURE Project 3 The &amp;#x27; Producer Unit Rescoping&amp;#x27; (PURE) pilot aims to test a new, geographic approach to implementing the Better Cotton Standard System to improve efﬁciency, effectiveness and sustainability of the program by supporting more holistic, community-based approaches by rescoping 3PUs into 1 larger PU in Karimnagar and Warangal districts of T elangana . Better Cotton’s Producer Unit rescoping intervention has been designed with the 3-fold aim of (i) Enhancing capacity strengthening through community-based approaches focusing on natural resources, pest management, labor practices, gender equality, and sustainable livelihoods. (ii) Improving efﬁciency and scalability by reducing data administration, implementing alternative monitoring methods, and increasing producer unit scale. (iii) Facilitating improved stronger ﬁrst mile traceability and removing the need for physical segregation of cotton from individual farms. --- Page 4 --- KPI 1 15% reduction in effort (time) on data and administration by ﬁeld staff KPI 3 Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing, without an increase in project cost KPI 5 Change in conﬁdence level in MEL (Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning) data vs. traditional PU approach KPI 2 15% increase in women&amp;#x27;s participation in Better Cotton (BC) activities KPI 4 Change in conﬁdence level in assurance results vs. traditional PU approach KPI 7 Change in volume of Better Cotton in the supply chain, credibility, and traceability issues KPI 6 Change in farmers/workers reached through capacity strengthening, and improvement in knowledge, attitude, and practice adoption List of PURE Project Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Evaluate the project outcomes (at baseline) against its pre-deﬁned objectives &amp;amp; Validate program problem statements; thus verifying the key assumptions on which the program theory of Change rests.

Suggestions for improvement ● Recommend providing tablets for efﬁcient data management, ● Organizing separate meetings for women farmers, and ● Incorporating more audiovisual tools to enhance training effectiveness. ● Crucial to spent time on educating FFs as farmers are curious to know more about new techniques. ● Having a dedicated tech-based application for data collection may be useful so FFs can directly feed data into a device, thereby reducing data entry time which could be spent in understanding and addressing farmer challenges. ● Engaging with farmers is more impactful than data tasks. --- Page 12 --- KPI 2 - Increased women participation in program activities 12 Percentage female program farmers in each PU, out of total program farmers Percentage female co-farmers in each PU, out of total co-farmers ❖ Women struggle to balance between domestic responsibilities and farming, have a natural preference for the former. ❖ Motivation to join Better Cotton program: T o enhance the quality of their crops and ﬁnancially support their households. ❖ Facilities provided during the trainings: Chairs, Water, &amp;amp; Access to toilets. ❖ Women from INTL23 require more training and handholding support to adopt Better Cotton farming practices --- Page 13 --- KPI 2 - Increased women participation in program activities 13 PU Program farmers (female) Co-farmers (female) Non-program farmers (female) Older PU (INTL01/ INTL02) ● Find learning about the effects of harmful pesticides and opting for organic fertilizers and intercropping instead, exposure visits to be most valuable in the trainings. ● Women&amp;#x27;s participation in meetings and mobility increased after joining the program. ● Felt no discrimination with respect to the accessing training programmes as compared to program farmers. ● Learnt the importance of wearing gloves, have switched from using urea/cocktails to compost and neem oil after joining the Better Cotton program. Inputs costs have reduced due to organic fertilizers usage. ● Women feel empowered with knowledge and ﬁnancial independence. ● Most women have not attended or heard of any Better Cotton trainings in the past ● They use cocktails and other chemicals like Urea and DAP ● Women eager to join the Better Cotton program to learn new techniques for improving their cotton crop quality however, want the training to be held at times convenient to them. Newer PU (INTL23) ● Women claim not learning anything new from the Better Cotton training, which they said are lengthy. Negligible impact on program women farmers agency till now. ● Women averse to using organic fertilizers due to discouraging past experiences. ● Since joining Better Cotton, they have switched from using DAP urea to organic fertilizers, which has lead to increase in their yield. They use PPE kits as well. ● Despite attending meetings, 70% of co-farmers do not follow the recommended practices. ● Farmers ﬁnd farm exposure visits to be particularly useful. ● Eager to join the Better Cotton program but require the training to be held at times convenient to them. ● Expressed preference for separate women-only meetings ● Informed that decisions, both related to farming and household, are largely taken by their male counterparts --- Page 14 --- ❖ Extent of adoption of practices is relatively higher in the older PUs as compared to the new PU. ❖ Aspects of training, farmers like the most: Learning new topics (94%) teaching methodology of the FF (72%) , handholding support provided in adoption of practices (61%) and going on exposure visits (91%) ❖ Main beneﬁts from the program: Higher yield and improved quality of cotton (higher for new PU of INTL 23 compared to the older PUs) ❖ Impact of Better Cotton Program: Decrease dependence on chemicals like monocrotophos and cocktails; Costs have decreased, and crop yields have signiﬁcantly improved, leading to better prices in the market. ❖ Motivation to join the Program : The opportunity to learn improved farming techniques, potential increase in income and improvement in soil health ❖ 25% respondents state lack of time due to domestic and occupational chores as a major challenge in regularly attending the training sessions. ❖ Lead farmers are highly motivated to educate their farmers on best practices; have also stoked the interest of non-program farmers. KPI 6 - Change in number of farmers reached through Capacity Strengthening Percentage male program farmers in each PU, of total program farmers --- Page 15 --- PU Older PU (INTL 01/02) New PU (INTL 23) Program farmers (male) ● Beneﬁtted due to reduction in expenses and improvement in yield post making use of organic fertilizers as opposed to using chemical fertilizers previously. ● FFBs maintained diligently by the farmers ● Mention audio visuals being the best medium for learning new concepts. ● Farmers joining the Better Cotton program later were inspired by the progress of Better Cotton farmers using fewer pesticides and participating in rallies and AVs. ● Quality of life of program farmers enhanced post joining the Better Cotton program. ● Farmers informed that they could purchase chairs for their home, educate their children and some could also convert their kutcha houses (non-durable) to pucca houses (strong and durable). ● Reduction in the use of hazardous chemicals and increased adoption of safer practices like using green color pesticides instead of red . ● FFB not maintained/updated by the farmers regularly ● Female farmers rarely attend meetings due to household chores &amp;amp; decision making authority lies majorly with the male member. ● Would be helpful if duration of meetings is reduced to 45 minutes. ● Farmers expressed a desire for more audio-visual training tools and better safety materials. KPI 6 - Change in number of farmers reached through Capacity Strengthening 15 --- Page 16 --- KPI 3 - Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing 16 Year-wise area under licensed Better Cotton production (Ha) by PU Y ear-wise cotton harvested (MT) by PU On average, from 2021 to 2023, the area under cotton production has increased by 13.5% for INTL01, 7.5% for INTL02 and 16.5% for INTL23 and cotton production has increased by 6.65%, 8.15% and 14.58% for INTL01, 02 and 23 respectively. --- Page 17 --- On average, the volume of licensed cotton has increased by 8.19%, 8.13%, and 17.29% for INTL01, INTL02 and INTL23 from 2021 to 2023 respectively. Of the volumes licensed in 2021-22, about 86%, 75% and 97% from INTL01, 02 and 23 was actually absorbed in the supply chain. No Better Cotton could be pushed into the supply chain in the years 2022-23 and 2023-24 as the program team has been encountering challenges with ginner registrations and had to deal with high administrative workloads for uploading uptake data in their dedicated portal. KPI 3 - Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing 17 Year-wise volumes of cotton licensed (MT) by PU Y ear-wise uptake of licensed cotton in the supply chain (%) by PU --- Page 18 --- KPI 3 - Increase in volumes of Better Cotton eligible for licensing 18 --- Page 19 --- ● Assurance coordinator indicates high level of conﬁdence in the assurance system. ● Robust sampling methods, random LG selection, and consistent data triangulation Conﬁdence ● Extensive data veriﬁcation and assessments across PUs once every 3 years ● Conduct licensing audits and surveillance audits to assess compliance. Comprehensive ● Around 60% of the assessments are done by 3PVs, ensuring objectivity and independence ● 3PVs perform risk proﬁling before assessments, interviewing independent stakeholders to identify potential issues 3 PV ● Logistical challenges in reaching remote locations for assessments. ● Time constraints due to a short three-day assessment period. ● Issues with disqualiﬁed LGs rebranding themselves, complicating the veriﬁcation process. Challenges KPI 4 - Change in level of conﬁdence in the assurance results --- Page 20 --- KPI 5 - Change in level of conﬁdence in MEL data ● Data on farmer lists/ seasonal estimates, adoption data, RIR, soil health, water resources, PRA, disadvantaged individuals and degraded lands collected from ﬁeld. Data collection on ﬁeld ● Reach, RIR, training data and contextual information required for tracking progress of PUs. ● Data reported within deadlines however, seeking clariﬁcations from ﬁeld may be time-consuming. Reporting requirements of Better Cotton ● MEL coordinator indicates medium to high level of conﬁdence in MEL processes. ● APUM checks 40% to 50% of data, the PUM checks 10%, and the project coordinator veriﬁes 3 to 5% data. Conﬁdence ● Rectifying data collection, entry errors and issues with sampling of large farmers. ● Reporting of same yield by many farmers, issues with units of conversion raises concerns of accuracy. Challenges --- Page 21 --- Financial and Operational Constraints Ginners face ﬁnancial and operational difﬁculties in segregating Better Cotton from conventional cotton Positive Outlook with Rescoping Ginners are optimistic that geographic rescoping will improve the efﬁciency of segregation and help them process Better Cotton more effectively Farmers sell cotton to private parties on credit in a decentralized distribution network, complicating the accumulation of sufﬁcient Better Cotton. Increase in demand of farmers for higher market rates for Better Cotton. Market Complexities Credibility Issues Some Better Cotton ends up with non-registered ginners, leading to gaps in reporting and traceability. Suggestions for Improvement Better collectivization and grouping of cotton as per quality. KPI 7 - Uptake and credibility issues within the Supply Chain . --- Page 22 --- Recommendations to Program Design 22 Organize farmer meetings speciﬁcally for women Expand reach of demonstrations. Use more audiovisual tools Simplify data collection for PUMs to free up time for Capacity Strengthening activities • For FFs, PUMs and PC • Male and Female Program farmers, Lead farmers, Non-program and Co-farmers Farmers demand high-quality seeds, PPE kits, storage bags Season-wise trainings at a convenient time Organize women-speciﬁc farmer meetings at convenient timings --- Page 23 --- Recommendations to Program Design 23 Broader chunk of information to be shared before assessments • Third party veriﬁers, Assurance coordinator • MEL coordinator Need to exercise caution in sampling of lead farmers • Better Cotton - registered ginner Aggregation and sale of Better Cotton in large quantities by the farmers will help in ensuring separate processing and higher uptake of Better Cotton • Evaluation T eam Recommend using RCEEIS evaluation criteria at the endline to gauge attainment of project outcomes &amp;amp; strategies to scale up --- Page 24 --- Thankyou! 24</Content>

Comments on the TOR This is our proposal for collaborating with CIFF - “India Low Carbon Agriculture: For Monitoring, Learning &amp;amp; Evaluation” as the lead Evaluation Partner, an effective and sustainable evaluation culture, system and process by championing the designing of the M&amp;amp;E framework, collecting data (qualitative and quantitative) to explore, analyse, interpret, and report the results of the programme, thereby empowering the investment, programme and to help the MRV and implementing partners under the investment, obtain real time insights and learn to adapt and solve in the emerging contexts and dynamics We are excited and would welcome the opportunity of being the lead Evaluation Partner with CIFF as the biggest private contributors to climate mitigation and other key stakeholders in this ambitious but critical programme with a strategic priority, and the objective to transform the land use and the integrated food systems. With an intent to deliver an “Integrated land use system that can feed 10 Billion people by 2050”, we agree that the, natural carbon sinks need to be protected and sustainably managed, natural habitat needs to be restored, emissions need to be reduced along-with improvement in livelihoods and nutritional value through better production of agricultural and forestry commodities and consumptions need to be shifted towards a food system that delivers for all through pragmatic solutions at scale. This proposal is being submitted by Catalyst Management Services (CMS), a 26-year old organisation enabling partners to leverage the strength of evidence and learning to bring lasting social change. We have structured our proposal in four parts: 1. We start with articulating our understanding of the purpose, approaches and key essence of the proposed investment, “Proof of Concept (PoC) - India Low Carbon Agriculture” followed by highlighting our motivation, experience and expertise in collaboration as the lead Evaluation Partner . (2 pages) 2. In the second part, the core technical component, a brief on the expectations, objectives and scope of the programme synthesising our understanding is used as a lens to build up to the MLE framework and approach for the proposed engagement, its relevance and signiﬁcance leading to the objectives and scope of the evaluation. The proposed framework encompasses multiple approaches to effectively achieve the objectives of the evaluation, and correspondingly the source of data, sampling approaches, key outputs, timelines and milestones of the engagement are highlighted. The institutional arrangements between CMS, CIFF, MRV and implementation partners to effectively steer and implement this process is highlighted here. (5 pages) 3. The third part of the proposal highlights the key attitudes and capacities that are required amongst the team members to enable an effective evaluation of the proposed study. In this context, we share the proposed team structure, key members, their expertise and the level of engagement at various stages of the evaluation . We also highlight here our relevant demonstrated experiences and explanation of how the proposed approaches were used in a similar context to the proposed study objectives and scope. A detailed list of work and capacity statements of the CMS and the advisors is annexed to provide more information, along with CVs of the key personnel. (1 pages) 4. The fourth and ﬁnal part of the proposal has the ﬁnancial proposal (summary and detailed) along with the narrative. (1 pages) 3 --- Page 5 --- 2. Our understanding of the PoC Investment and the evaluation needs As evaluation partners, it is important for us to understand the program as a whole and its key essence, uniqueness, implementation approaches and the context in which the PoC is situated. Based on the ToR shared with us and our understanding of the work, we have brought together the following ‘ Program Intentional Design and Approach ’ summarising key points that deﬁne its ‘ ambition, essence and characteristics ’.

Land and ecosystem degradation, mono-cropping, non-sustainable agricultural practices, high use of fertilisers (urea) 4. Vulnerable to climate impacts, reliance on monsoon, stress on ground-water 5. Low yield – inequality and poverty; limited access to market; weak linkages between agriculture and nutrition Investment India Low Carbon Agriculture: Terms of Reference (ToR) For Monitoring, Learning &amp;amp; Evaluation Table 1. Program Intentional Design and Approach The CIFF LCA ToR details the action ToC in annexures, that clearly captures the various activities planned at the programme level, envisioned to cascade a set of outputs. Given some of the causal and action pathways aren’t explicit and intervention details at the farm/farmer level, ecosystem level are not available, one of the critical place to start would be to construct clear, concise causal ToC and ToA - Theory of Action in collaboration with the CIFF PoC Investment Team and the CIFF Investment Implementation Partners. Given the objectives and the scope of work of the study proposed, its CMSs’ interpretation that, a deep rooted framework and a combination of methods is critical to generate and interpret using evidence, whether the PoC investment has progressed and delivered the intended results in line with the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set for the study. In summary, CMS as an evaluation partner intends to, 1. Using a multiplicity of approaches such as outcome mapping, contribution analysis and conventional mixed method longitudinal study, the evaluation and evidences, a. To generate insights, rationale and decision making cascade b. To understand the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the PoC Investment c. A robust cascade to the intended and unintended impact of the PoC Investment d. To sustain the investment outcomes 2. Test for the integrity, reliability and validity of the data and evidence sources to support and strengthen the evidence reporting by working closely with the partners a. Provide an evidence centered approach to establish, concurrently improve the PoC Investment level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - The Investment Cascade b. Provide and evidence based feedback to concurrently improve the partner level programme monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - Results Framework 3. Set up a versatile, agile and responsive Learning Management System (LMS) reinforced by the MEAL system to inform the PoC Investment to, a. Channelise the programme course correction, expansion and reformation to equip CIFF and its partners 5 --- Page 7 --- b. Establish a wider learning and development mechanism to understand the sectoral implications, contributions through the PoC investment in the ﬁeld of LCA and associated climate action 3. Our motivation statement, experience and expertise CMS’s vision is a future where holistic and well-orchestrated partnerships &amp;amp; investments create impact that is transformational in driving sustainable and scalable equity. We at CMS believe strongly in partnering as ‘learning facilitators’ to co-learn and shape outcomes for partners in the social impact space. We proudly call ourselves as ‘Solvists’ combining our solution seeking approach with activism mindset, intensity and urgency to bring change. Our key portfolio, appropriately named as ‘ Evidence for Change ’ partners with social impact organisations to generate evidence, insights and learning to help them to analyse, make sense and respond well to implement and impact effectively. While we undertake and have expertise in various types of evaluations, we believe and demonstrate experiences in country level and investment level evaluations and approaches in contexts of sustainable and low carbon agricultural systems and value chains, regenerative, climate responsive and resilient agricultural ecosystems. Our ambition as an organisation is to contribute to impact, scale and sustainability. We achieve this by partnering with large scale/deep change makers (in this context, AKRSP(I), AKF, FES, WASSAN and Vetriver ) and the investors (in this context CIFF ), enabling them to succeed through our capabilities of evaluation partnerships. To this end, deepening our work with CIFF is a strategic proposition for us. CIFF has been a pivotal partnership in nurturing our degree of association with the aforementioned SDGs since 2019. Monitoring, Learning and Evaluation (MLE) for India Low Carbon Agriculture in India is an exciting partnership opportunity that will expand CMS’s work with pioneers in climate action to imminent partners in India’s low carbon and sustainable agriculture ecosystems and value chains, including CIFF’s partners ( AKRSP(I), AKF, FES, WASSAN and Vertiver ) and more (academia, industry, government stakeholders, energy and environmental consultants, etc.). We believe that it is important for CMS as a learning journey partner in climate action to understand the inﬂuence of monitoring and evaluation in transforming key business decisions and institutional mechanisms across climate action sub-domains and organisations. CMS, social impact specialists, we are people who help and enable partners to achieve scale, impact and sustainability. CMSs’ experience of evaluation draws on insights about complex dynamic systems, uncertainty, nonlinearity, and emergence and how this could be used for a range of purposes: ongoing program development, adapting effective principles of practice to local contexts, generating innovations and taking them to scale, and facilitating rapid response in difﬁcult situations. CMS has worked with CIFF India’s power, clean air and cooling portfolio partners to co-create and deploy theories of change, cascade to impact, results frameworks, partner and programme level management information systems (MIS) and Interactive tech-enabled dashboards. The details of each of these projects and contexts are given in the Annexe 2 . CMS is part of Catalyst Group of Institutions, which includes Vrutti (i.e., a livelihoods focussed organisation), Swasti (i.e., a health focussed organisation) and Genetic Resources, Ecology, Energy and Nutrition Foundation (GREEN Foundation), which focuses on regenerative agroecological practices. GREEN Foundation has pioneered agro-biodiversity work in the country. It has worked 6 --- Page 8 --- with women farmers to develop models of in-situ and ex-situ conservation using agro-ecological practices, promoting Farmer Producer Organisations and linking farmers’ products to the market. GREEN Foundation works as a social lab for CMS and currently a model of regenerative agriculture is being piloted in ﬁve locations in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Hence, our understanding of LCA is deep as we practice it ourselves. As practitioners, we are keen to be part of LCA models being implemented to bring in system-wide change at a scale and contribute towards shaping the same. We see tremendous opportunity for cross-learning and developing knowledge products from this engagement. 4. Our approach to the evaluation exercise As evaluation partner, CMS understands the PoC Investment is proposed for two years, i.e., the activities will happen during the period of October 2021 to December 2023 . The objectives and the scope of work for the evaluation partner are clearly deﬁned in the ToR, therefore we have proposed the MLE Framework , Analytical Framework and the Deliverables aligned with the corresponding expectations. As an established evaluation partner in the sector, it is at the core of CMSs’ belief that to have an effective evaluation and the investment sustenance, co-developing the design and embedding the evaluation effectively with the programme is essential. Hence we emphasise on a longer term partnership with the program being effective, and the deliverables of the impact evaluation would include the concurrent performance and the impact evaluation report, clear &amp;amp; concise learning feedback reports for course correction, reformation and expansion based on the design, methods and resources agreed on during the process. Expectations from Evaluation Lead Partner Scope of the study A. Progress and results a. To what extent is there evidence the PoC investment has made progress and delivered results in line with its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)? b. What are the data and evidence sources (and how reliable are they) to support future KPI progress and wider investment results reporting? B. Course correction and wider learning a. What key course corrections should CIFF and its partners make in any future investment beyond the PoC? b.

Chief integrator of evidence and evidence based decision making 2. A Knowledge centre to feedback key insights, learnings for course correction 3. An evangeliser to communicate effectively and sensitively 4. A responsible sectoral lever in aggregating and effecting outcomes and impact Table 2. Expectations from Evaluation Lead Partner 4.1. ToC and Causal Pathways The current ToC as depicted in the Terms of Reference, is an action based ToC, which envisages outcomes at farmer, government and market level. The investments and actions at the farmer level leading to outcomes at farmer level are clear and logical. But, the investments and actions at government and market level are not speciﬁed. Whether the programme intends to engage with and inﬂuence government and market directly or the changes at the farmer level are expected to lead to changes at government and market level as outcomes, are unclear. How and why the government will bring LCA supportive policies or bring changes to MSP of LCA crops? Why will the market bring in LCA supportive procurement rules and prioritise LCA crops? The causal ToC for the programme is missing. It is critical from an MEL perspective to answer these questions and understand the causality envisaged for the programme, including assumptions and risks. 8 --- Page 10 --- Figure 1. TOC and causal pathways with assumptions We propose that the action ToC be revisited and a causal indicator based ToC be developed for the purposes of this assignment. CSM will work with CIFF to develop and reﬁne the ToCs. 4.2. MLE Framework Multiplicity of approaches are imminent to sequester the objectives and scope of work laid out for the evaluation partner. Using a multiplicity of approaches is warranted given the nature of investment, implementation and data generation. CMS given the context, proposes utilising the following approaches integrating to form the MLE framework, Figure 2. MLE Framework proposed for the study 4.2.1. Contribution Tracing (CT) Contribution tracing is a prospective evidence driven method adopted in the context of our study to evaluate the impact of activities, interventions, programmes or policies by applying principles of process tracing and Bayesian updating. Contribution claims arising out of the PoC Investment, is envisioned to be a clear, speciﬁc outcome measure that allows us to track through intervention processes or policies that have contributed to a change or a decision aligned with the ToC being co-created. The approach is retrospective ex-post facto of the outcome. In our context, since the outcomes are envisioned at various levels, i.e,. ecosystems, partner, farmer/farm levels the outcome claims could be established from the partners as part of their regular reporting or from the larger ecosystem itself through a sectoral tracker. 9 --- Page 11 --- This is an iterative process as illustrated in the ﬁgure below. Figure 3. Contribution Tracing Schema A contribution trial (peer-review mechanism), would be the testament for the highest quality evidence available and the panels’ conﬁdence on the evidence. Applying process tracing tests to estimate the sensitivity and uniqueness of proof. Sensitivity refers to how closely the piece of contribution / evidence tracks the contribution (event), i.e., how necessary is it that we ﬁnd this evidence when the event (or contribution) has indeed happened. Evidence Case Sensitivity 1 Uniqueness** Conﬁdence CAC Contribution(s) qualiﬁed upon items of proof Contribution Qualiﬁcation/ Assessment Evidence we would ‘ Expect to see’ Necessary conditions Useful for conﬁrming and disconﬁrming Contributions Evidence necessary and sufﬁcient to establish contribution trial (cause-effect) Contribution conﬁrmation 4.2.2. Outcome mapping (OM) Outcome mapping (OM) in the context of our proposed MLE Framework, is a complementary, concurrent methodology for planning, monitoring and evaluating CIFF PoC level Investment outcomes. in the study context, OM intends to assist the investment, identify the partners and ToC pathways, that needs to be effected, inﬂuenced, result driven and strategise at the intent and intervention level to streamline process efﬁciencies. OM provides a framework to collect and 1 Arrived post consultation with an informed panel or jury about the case, its context and available information. 10 --- Page 12 --- validate immediate (expect to see), intermediate (like to see) and transformative changes (love to see). Following steps could be adopted to design and implement OM system: 1. Develop the vision and the mission of the programme. 2. Identify boundary partners – individuals, groups and institutions with whom the programme intends to interact directly and inﬂuence their behaviour. 3. Phrase outcome challenge statement, which includes changes in actions, activities, behaviour and relationships of the boundary partners, which will then contribute towards the mission and vision of the programme or organisation. 4. Identify progress markers – Progress markers are like indicators. Unlike indicators, progress markers depict change in the outcomes in a gradual manner, i.e., expect to see, like to see and love to see. 5. Develop strategies to achieve the changes in the boundary partners as well as changes in the ecosystem within which the boundary partners operate. 6. Ascertain organisational practices to support the changes in the boundary partners. 7. Identify monitoring priorities, developing outcome journals and performance journals for data collection. This will be developed in detail with CIFF and the programme team. We have budgeted out costs for design, hand holding and troubleshooting. The budget does not include cost for implementation, which should be done by the programme and the partners. 4.2.3. Contribution analysis (CA) In the context of the current study, one of the key questions the MLE framework is intending to answer is understanding the attribution of the PoC Investment, the value addition that the programme or the project has made towards the observed changes or in the results? In the cohort study proposed, the attribution is analysed using an econometric design, but the intention of the complementary design is to augment the gaps and limitations of the experimental or quasi-experimental design, such as feasibility, ethics and resources. Contribution analysis veriﬁes the ToC behind a programme, robustness of the causality, assumptions and risks and other inﬂuencing factors including inﬂuences from similar programmes or initiatives. Causality in our context, is inferred from the following: 1. Whether deﬁned activities were implemented and the degree of progress? 2. Whether outcomes were achieved and the degree of outcome realisation? 3. What were the contributions of the programme to the achievement of outcomes? 4. Whether assumptions were sound, plausible and agreed? 5. Whether assumptions were true and risks, if any, were mitigated? 6. What was the evidence to support the above? 7. What were the other inﬂuencing factors and actors and what were their inﬂuences to the achievement of outcomes; what was the evidence supporting the same? Evidence gathered through the desk research, secondary data analysis, Cohort Study, MIS, Outcome Monitoring, Learning Management System and End line will be used to answer the above questions. 11 --- Page 13 --- This will be done by the Evaluation Lead Partner and presented to CIFF PoC Investment team, CIFF implementation partner, MRV partners etc. CIFF will validate the ﬁndings and provide feedback, which will then be incorporated and ﬁnalized. The exact methodology of the contribution analysis will be designed and agreed with CIFF PoC Investment team. Contribution analysis is a type of impact analysis of the programme, which may or may not be as rigorous as experimental or quasi experimental designs, but will provide some assessment of the impact. A frame for analysis is presented below: 4.2.4. Cohort Study (CS) A quasi-experimental mixed method approach is proposed for the cohort study to engage with the key target population, in this context with the farmer across UP, Gujarat and MP working with the implementation partner AKF &amp;amp; AKRSP(I) to compare outcomes between two cohorts of farmers – those who have been part of the current PoC Investment (i.e., the treatment group) and those who have not been enrolled or beneﬁtted as a resultant of the current investment (i.e., the comparison group ), in order to ascertain the advantages and beneﬁts accruing from the current investment at 2 the farmer and farm level. The overall methodology will entail a pre-post comparison of key outcomes through Baseline (October 2021) and Endline (December 2023) longitudinal cohort tracking for key performance indicators between the two groups to establish the causality and attribution of the treatment effects to the PoC investment. The evaluation design proposed would overlay on the proposed TOC and causal pathways to strengthen the evaluation outcomes and the baseline data collection will provide the basis for subsequent assessment of how efﬁciently and effectively the activities are being implemented and the eventual results achieved. Primary data collection is proposed to be at the core of this methodology and will include extensive data collection through ﬁeld visits, covering multiple stakeholders, with the objective of thorough process documentation. A healthy proportion of both quantitative and qualitative data and insights using the technique of triangulation to support our analysis. The indicative sample size for the above speciﬁcation is proposed to be 3300, explained in the detailed sampling methodology . This indicates 2000 respondents from the treatment area and the rest 1300 from the control area. Based on the availability of the information about treatment and control group clusters, we can update the model to calculate the appropriate sample size. Description Clustering parameters Treatment group Comparison group No. of farmers / farms TBD 2,000 1,300 4.4. Analytical Framework The multifaceted design proposed in the MLE Framework assists us in understanding the outcomes ex-post in nature for answering the critical KPIs established at the PoC Investment level will use the OECD-DAC criteria of REEIS, i.e., Relevance, Efﬁciency, Effectiveness, Impact and Sustainability to interpret and enable decision making effectively. For integrating the other complementary methods 2 The comparison group will be constituted only if AKF &amp;amp; AKRSP(I) is able to identify a similar socio-demographic proﬁle, agro-proﬁling, agro-practice engagement, farm based livelihood engagement, market participation, market opportunity etc. as that of the treatment group across the same agro-ecological zones. 12 --- Page 14 --- proposed such as Contribution Tracing, Contribution Analysis and Outcome Mapping, the nature of the methods being ad-hoc and concurrent, a signiﬁcant effort, sensitivity and robustness is overlaid on the analytical frame to classify the outcomes as Direct, Indirect, Catalytic or no effect and in the eventuality, the evaluation exercises will also try to bring perspective on what would not happen without CIFF’s intervention, and if elicited by CIFF, what would the PoC Investments’ attribution or contribution. The Theory of Change proposed to be established and PoC Investment level Cascade and the Results Framework, will guide the analytical frame of outcomes of the investment at the ecosystem, partner and the programme level. Longitudinal assessments and the complementary methods are approached with the Participatory Action Research, involving representatives of all key stakeholders in administering the process. Given the integration of outputs from various methods in the MLE framework, the proposed analytical frame would be adept in answering not only the performance of the PoC Investment, but would also provide a confounding view of the changes and outcomes at the sectoral and ecosystem level resulting from the efforts of partners, investment and eventually the network effects. The post facto synthesis is effectively proposed to be utilised by the Learning Management System proposed for the study to reﬂect, learn and capacitate key stakeholders in the value chain. As a responsible LMS integrator, CMS would champion the process of evangelising the learnings and feedback for the CIFF 13 --- Page 15 --- Investment Team, Partner with an accountability for adoption and creating a knowledge asset at the sectoral and ecosystem level. The key outcomes we have envisioned for the LMS, would be to analyse, interpret, contextualise and amplify the evaluation outcomes using responsible synthesis, accelerating capacities and foster evidence based decision making. 5. Evaluation team and the rationale for the proposition As mentioned earlier we use multiplicity of approaches which are Contribution tracing, outcome mapping, contribution analysis and conventional mixed method quasi-experimental design for the longitudinal study, the evaluation would generate a robust set of evidence which would be used to evaluate outcomes at various levels. This has been kept at the core of the people strategy for the evaluation. The advisory panel has been constituted keeping in mind the different approaches we have proposed for the evaluation, three experts across the domains of LCA, agriculture and MLE with combined experience of over 60 years have been identiﬁed for the engagement. Each approach proposed has a dedicated team lead by an expert who has over 5 years of experience in the said approach. The evaluation teams are led by Mr. Sivaramakrishnan Balasubramanian who has over 10 years of extensive experience in leading large scale evaluations across diverse approaches and geographies. The team has been chosen based on the their abilities to collaborate and co-create with the partners, systematic thinkers who can design utilisation focussed rigorous evaluations that are context speciﬁc, people who can build perspectives, enable and empower the teams, people who can build relationships and put program and people at the centre but hold 14 --- Page 16 --- collective responsibility. Please refer to Annexe 3 for more information on the proposed team members. 6. Financial Proposal From CMSs’ past experiences, the approach to budgeting an concurrent, integrated evaluation such as this is most often complex, evolving and resource driven. Understanding the context of the proposed study, key stakeholders and partnerships involved, extending geography, we have created a budgeting logic for the critical costheaders, resource requirements with a revolving scope for absorbing any evolution in the system as we progress over the year with a set of valid assumptions. The largest component of the budget proposition is centered towards the professional fees for the resources (Evaluation Team, LMS and MRV interfacing teams) as the evaluation is driven by the competencies and inputs of the team. To overlay the domain (LCA and agro-climatic expertise) expertise to the evaluation, we have proposed 3 experts in the advisory capacity and their costing has been embedded. To support data being collected by our internal set of enumerators and moderators from the community engagement team across geographies in India to support the process of data collection and evidence generation, a ﬁeld budget component is accounted for. An inhouse communications expert would be utilised for designing reports, presentations or audio/visual briefs to CIFF and its partners and the costs associated with dissemination is budgeted as a separate header. Overall, the summary of the budget proposed inclusive of in-direct costs @10% of the gross sum, and the grand total of budget proposed accounts to $338,481/ -. The exclusive component of Taxes, i.e., GST is not applicable if the consumption of services is outside of the country. If any of the service outputs are consumed by the contracting agency/partners within India, a standard 18% GST would be applicable in addition to the budget proposed. Upon clarity, this component could be discussed at the contracting stage. Description Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Total 15-Oct-2021 - 14-Oct-2022 15-Oct-2022 - 14-Oct-2023 15-Oct-2023 -29-02-2024 Professional Fees / HR Costs $111,867.00 $111,867.00 $37,800.00 $261,535.0 0 Travel Costs [breakup provided below] $5,850.00 $4,950.00 $3,375.00 $14,175.00 Data Collection Cost [Cohort study - Longitudinal] $16,000.00 $16,000.00 $32,000.00 Indirect costs/Overhead costs $30,771.00 Grand Total $338,481.0 0 15 --- Page 17 --- 7. Annexures 7.1. Annexe 1- Lessons from working with CIFF so far ● Use of Results Framework : The results framework’s output level disaggregation is useful mainly for CIFF to track partners’ accountability to promised deliverables. This type of system works best for grantees that have inadequate or no existing project management (PM) systems. Partners with existing PM systems may perceive the MIS reporting processes as a duplication of effort. ● Use of Theory of Change : Partners’ capacities need to be built and MLE systems need to be reﬁned to enable better assimilation and application of the Theory of Change. Theory of Change Integrating programmatic categories in the TOC-based results frameworks for Power and Clean Air- similar to the introduction of programmatic work streams in the cooling results framework- may be a useful step in this direction. A broad Theory of Change leads to weak causal chains, affecting CIFF’s ability to assess outcomes and see the needle move. We have to proceed with the cogninance that an outcome at CIFF investment level may sometimes be just a much needed input/activity/output at a sectoral level. ● Outcome Measurement : While CIFF expects outcome level reporting, many partners still report on an output level into the MIS. Partners are more used to determining outcomes and impact based on their larger interventions as opposed to each of their micro-outputs. This elucidates the need for either building partners’ capacities to assess outcomes of each output or modifying the system to better support partners’ outcomes capture. The evaluation function also needs to be strengthened to help CIFF better identify its outcomes and impact. ● Transparency and Ownership : Visibility to expectations around all CIFF-related MLE processes and corresponding results is important for partners to deliver consistently. Creating more data transparency and sharing key MLE insights at a programme level can help promote a greater sense of ownership towards MLE processes among partners. ● Use of Partners’ Meets : Partners’ meets typically have a disproportionate focus on progress updates and little space for collaborative reﬂections. CIFF has an opportunity to evolve the design of partners’ meets to encourage deep, sectoral reﬂection, promote constructive dialogue and generate knowledge that could improve partners’ approach and collaboration. Programmatic reﬂections must be informed by data from dashboards and partners’ MIS in order to incentivize partners to provide quality-assured inputs to the MIS. It will therefore be important to use an MLE prescribed reﬂection timeline moving forward. ● Synthesis and Stories : While CIFF has the intention and takes action to complete design at a sectoral level, there is an opportunity to strengthen sectoral level synthesis by collating sectoral knowledge across partners. There is also an opportunity to strengthen qualitative case study capture and stories of change across institutions. 7.2. Annexe 2 -Past relevant experience Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) Climate MLE. Working with CIFF India’s Power, Clean Air and Cooling portfolio partners to co-create and deploy Theories of Change, Cascade to 16 --- Page 18 --- Impact, Results Frameworks, Partner and Programme Level Management Information Systems (MIS) and Interactive, Tech-enabled Dashboards. Facilitated indicator design workshops with sectoral players. Conducted gating review and uncovered insights for investment course correction. Impact Assessment of Integrated Development initiatives implemented by AKRSP(l) in Dangs District of Gujarat with Hazira Port Private Limited and BAIF Institute for Sustainable Livelihoods and Development , CMS conducted an impact assessment of the programme being implemented by AKRSP in Gujarat. It was involved in assessing the impact of the programme at the individual, household as well as at the village level using both qualitative and quantitative indicators. CMS contributed in getting insights from the programme and contributed to the overall learnings from the programme in terms of the extent to which the program has achieved its goals against its key outcome and output and understand how and in what ways this outcome has been achieved. Avahan , Supported by BMGF, Avahan India AIDS Initiative was one of the largest HIV prevention programmes in the world on HIV vulnerability reduction. CMS worked with 1,36,000+ key population including Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men who have sex with Men (MSM) and Transgenders (TGs) to reduce their vulnerabilities and hence risk to HIV. The programme was implemented through 87 community organizations spread across ﬁve states and 67 districts and 432 locations. Joint strategic planning was conducted with each of the organizations by deeply embedded members from the CMS team. A customised plan and contextualised MEAL systems following uniﬁed programmatic priorities following the principles of development evaluations was created for each organisation. The team innovatively used a technology-enabled system that enabled scale and could help each of the users to engage with the community members in a more effective and efﬁcient way that was also cost-effective. A cohort database on each of the registered members, their service access and behaviour over a period of time was created and is being currently used to create a data-driven deﬁnition of vulnerability and to create an AI model by CMS in collaboration with Google and IIIT-D. This model is expected to segment community members for a targeted approach that will further reﬁne the intervention and make it more effective, cost-efﬁcient and ready for scale. Impact Evaluation of the National Rural Livelihoods Project , evaluation of the National Rural Livelihoods Programme (NRLP) under the aegis of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NLRM). Implemented between 2012 and 2019, the NRLM is a ﬂagship programme of the Indian government aimed at enhancing rural livelihoods and reducing poverty. DFID-CIKS-MEAL , The DFID-supported project “Poverty Reduction through Sustainable Agriculture in Southern India” started in July 2012 and ended in June 2015. It was implemented by CIKS and Vrutti in three Districts (Nagapattinam, Tiruvannamalai, and Kanchipuram) of Tamilnadu state in Southern India, to cover 9000 households spread across 75 Gram Panchayats. The project sought to enhance incomes of smallholder agricultural households in an accelerated and sustainable way. It was designed to deliver local and household-speciﬁc critical information, proven technologies, and practices through a mechanism of village-based agricultural service providers and focused convergence efforts. Speciﬁcally, the project delivered seven packages -home gardens, a full package of organic practices, quality seeds and fertility improvement products, bio-pesticides, market information and linkages, value addition, and allied activities like backyard poultry. 17 --- Page 19 --- CMS through its in-house livelihoods implementation partner Vrutti developed a comprehensive M&amp;amp;E system based on PALP (Planning, Accountability,Learning and Performance) framework. The entire system was developed through stakeholders’ consultations and discussions in MEAL Core Group meetings. The system acted as a decision support system , facilitated learning , provided a strong focus on addressing cross-cutting and organizational issues and provided adequate space for reﬂections. Designing and implementation of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning System for 16 Child-focused community development projects in South India . The system was designed for The Churches Council for Child and Youth Care. The components of the MEAL system included, Input-Activity Monitoring, Process Quality Monitoring, Output Tracking, Annual Reﬂection and Learning and Institutional Assessment. A performance Index was prepared for each of the projects using various components of the M&amp;amp;E system. Development of country level MLE framework, work plan and indicators for UNODC H-13 Project in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal: UNODC, Regional Ofﬁce for South Asia supported a project titled “Prevention of transmission of HIV among Drug Users in SAARC Countries” that was being implemented in partnership with the governments of the member countries of the SAARC region. One of the key subcomponents within the Project Management is a comprehensive MLE system for the project to enable effective monitoring of outputs and outcomes.

Annexe 5 - Sampling methodology Owing to the inclusion of a comparative group for the study, CMS proposes cluster randomisation approach adopted for the continuous primary end-point sampling design. Adopting from the KPIs, continuous variables like, ● % increase in acreage of farmland under Low Carbon Agriculture (LCA) system in the intervention regions ● % increase in farmers income due to adoption of LCA practices, The sampling frame is designed to test for a Minimum Effect size (Minimum difference between the treatment and control group) of 10% ascertain the beneﬁts accrued by the treated population attributed to the PoC investment. However, since the clustering logics are not available at this juncture, we propose layering the cluster randomisation as a co-creation exercise with AKF and AKRSP(I). The overall sample size for the longitudinal cohort study proposed would be in the range as mentioned in the table below, Parameters include – ● Minimum Effect size (Minimum difference between the treatment and control group)- 10% ● Alpha - 0.05 ● Beta - 0.2 ● Power - 0.8 7.6 Annexe 6 - Catalysts Management Services 7.6.1 Brief background and history Catalyst Management Services (CMS), is a Social Impact Specialist that helps partners achieve Scale, Impact and Sustainability. As Solvists - we are solution-focused activists who care. Our commitment to sustainable development, understanding of complexity, inequities, leads us to invest in ideas, individuals, and institutions, assembling multi-disciplinary teams in creating shared value and maximizing social returns. Our solutions range from Design (strategy and planning), Evidence (research, evaluation, and insights), Monitoring (systems, accountability, and performance), Learning systems (accretion and application) and technology for development. Working across the domains of livelihood, health, education, ﬁnance, governance, nutrition and humanitarian response, CMS has deep experience in policy, strategy, research, implementation, monitoring, capacity building, strategy and documentation. CMS nurtures collaborative platforms of diverse stakeholders, augmented by technology, to impact at scale for multiple vulnerable groups in different contexts. Established in 1994, CMS, based in India works across 30+ other countries, 23 --- Page 25 --- exporting India’s social development capacities and bringing back learning and goodwill. We are part of the Catalyst Group. CMS has worked with over 1000 organisations and pioneered three kinds of sectoral assets-Knowledge, Institutional and Financial assets. Over 75 knowledge assets consisting of tools, frameworks, methodology, indicator banks, sectoral TOCs, think pieces and technology solutions have been developed and made available to the sector. Institutional assets created include 200+ social enterprises incubated, many of whom are community-owned and professionally run, seven models which are sectoral re-engineering of systems to focus on the poor and marginalized, ﬁve sectoral networks as key promoters, three sectoral platforms and over 300 development sector leaders. Over one million lives have been enriched - by improvement in healthy days, improved incomes, resilient families, viable enterprises, etc. Over 500 organisations and programmes have been impacted - by improved reach, scale, efﬁciency, effectiveness, etc. CMS has also placed Rs 3000 crores in the hands of the communities and raised over 10,000 crores for social causes. 30 internal leaders, 400+ full staff of CMS (and its group entities) and over 500 Network Consultants continue to add value to the sector through a blend of engagements and investments (see diagram), with a wide variety of development partners to realise their potential to accelerate scale and impact, sustainably. 7.6.2 Main areas of focus, core business and range of clients Poverty and inequality have been growing worldwide. While many organisations work with the poor and marginalised communities to bring about change, their efﬁciency, scale, and effectiveness is limited by underleveraged social and management aspects. Community-focused solutions that are dynamic in design and work at scale are needed to address socio-economic and environmental challenges. We are driven by the challenge of ﬁnding innovative and scalable solutions for problems in development. We operate at the threshold of knowledge and learning, constantly looking for opportunities to leverage that which works, cross-pollinate ideas across sectors, and create and execute new models for new challenges. We are deeply committed to communities which are disadvantaged and work towards results for them while promoting human values, gender equity and overall development. We directly incubate and support ideas, organisations and leaders for a long period of time, sometimes well over a decade, leading to exponential development results. Some of our synergistic engagements have resulted in development laboratories where our staff converses directly with communities to shape their thinking and skills. What kinds of ideas? We incubate ideas till they become realistic development solutions, in the form of concepts, products, models and approaches. 24 --- Page 26 --- Two prominent examples are the 3-fold model (to build wealthy, resilient, and responsible farmers), and the i4we model (an exponential primary health care model). We have incubated more than 25 such ideas which have impacted farmers, rural poor, sex workers, women owned businesses, factory workers, bullock cart workers, milk vendors, etc. What kind of institutions? We support and promote community-based organisations (like ﬁsherfolk, sex workers, farmers), NGOs (those into service delivery, policy formulation), micro-ﬁnance institutions, producer companies and cooperatives. Some of our incubated ideas have become full-ﬂedged organisations – like Swasti Health Catalyst, Vrutti Livelihood Impact Partners and Fuzhio Health and Business Services Pvt. Limited. which operate as our sister organisations but have grown to be signiﬁcant development players in their own right. What kinds of leaders? Our leaders are people who work in the development sector, and who lead programmes, organisations and networks. They range from community leaders to those with NGOs, government departments, and corporate foundations. Some of these leaders work inside CMS (and the Catalyst group) and some work outside (alumni, clients and partners). Though informal, the combined leadership support in the form of mentoring, coaching, counselling and capacity development have delivered signiﬁcant results. How have we helped transform? We directly and indirectly contribute to signiﬁcant development outcomes, which are often independently assessed. With the help of committed, conﬁdent, capacitate and result-oriented leaders we have: ● Improved scale and reach ● Accelerated impact ● Enhanced viability ● Raised funds ● Facilitated control and ensured independence (over agenda, resources – for community organisations) ● Improved efﬁciency and effectiveness ● Ensured sustainability ● Helped succeed (agenda, leaders) Themes we work on CMS has worked on the areas of impact and programme evaluations, organizational assessments, monitoring research and learning, summative and performance evaluations, formative evaluations and exploratory research, action research; in agriculture, agri-business, livelihoods, enterprises, health child protection, vulnerable population (sex workers, transgender, women empowerment, 25 --- Page 27 --- gender equity, social protection, biodiversity, education and governance domains; and complex programmes that operate across levels and leverages multi sectoral support. We have carried out over 100 project/ programme evaluations and organisational assessments, using methods and approaches that help communities and programme staff to reﬂect, assess, learn and apply strategies. Our evaluation tools have been tested and demonstrated in a variety of domains and issues, such as innovations in education, child rights, activity based learning, domestic violence, early marriage, productivity enhancement in crops, social exclusion, livestock improvement, community-led learning outcome initiatives, etc. We partner with for-impact organisations and donors to design and execute use-focussed evaluations and research using rigorous and ﬁt-for-purpose methodologies. We believe in plurality of methodologies and have delivered quality impact evaluation through rigorous experimental, quasi-experimental designs, with mixed methods and participatory approaches as relevant, covering large sample sizes across multiple states in India and abroad. We bring the best of the multi-disciplinary experts in research and evaluations, from academic institutions and our work includes partnering with international bilaterateral/ multilateral organisations, philanthropic foundations, civil society organizations and other sectoral networks and platforms. 7.6.3 Geographical areas of activity CMS has over the last three decades has worked across 30+ countries and is headquartered in India. We have experience in working across almost all states in India. Through our ofﬁces, our team and our networks, we are present in at least 20 states and have demonstrated multilingual work capacities within India including locations that are geographically difﬁcult to access. Apart from India, we also have extensive presence in other Asian countries. i.e., in Nepal, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Myanmar, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Timor Leste, Vietnam, Philippines through our network of collaborators and have strong experience in working in these locations. Our experience of demonstrated work outside of Asia includes countries such as Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, South Africa, Zanzibar, Swaziland, United Kingdom and USA through our team and local partners. 26</Content>

The study, overseen by CMS, employs a mixed-concurrent methodology, covering 576 households, Focus Group Discussions, and Key Informant Interviews. This approach ensures a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting livelihoods and household economies. Impact evaluation of the C&amp;amp;A Foundation (now Laudes Foundation) and Cotton Connect supported Organic Cotton Farmer training program (3ie, Cotton Connect) (2014-2024) CMS conducted a six-year impact evaluation of the Organic Cotton Farmer training program, aimed at supporting 16,000 farmers in India to transition to an organic production system. The study, including a three-year organic certiﬁcation period, assessed the viability of organic cotton production compared to conventional methods and the success of farmers adopting it through extension services. Utilising a quasi-experimental design and mixed methods, the evaluation covered over 8,000 program and non-program farmers across Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. Baseline Study of “Accelerating Income: Strong Organisations, Thriving Farmers Project” for Heifer Project International (September 2020 - February 2021) Heifer International sought to launch a new project in Andhra Pradesh, a region where they hadn&amp;#x27;t previously operated. After exploring four districts (Krishna, East Godavari, Nellore, and Anantapur), the organisation aimed to enhance Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) by introducing poultry production in the state. The goal was to develop, test, and reﬁne a poultry intervention model that complements existing value chains for FPOs and Small Holder Farmers (SHFs). The initial 30-month phase focused on supporting pro-poor farmers toward achieving a living income. CMS provided baseline services enabling Heifer to measure various indicators, from social capital to actual income levels, at both FPO and household levels.

Objectives of the Baseline Study: Given the context of the program, the overall objective of the study is to: ● Utilise the baseline as a robust benchmark to assess project success by 2027, ensuring thorough evaluation criteria. ● Collaborating with AKRSPI and Lupin to reﬁne project and monitoring plans based on baseline insights, optimising its project outcomes. ● To enhance methods for assessing empowerment throughout project implementation, drawing on diverse perspectives and expertise. ● Emphasising the importance of capturing nuanced aspects of empowerment beyond simplistic survey responses, acknowledging the complexity of women&amp;#x27;s experiences and perspectives. 2.1.3. Scope of the Study The study entails conducting a baseline assessment of the two GIF-funded women&amp;#x27;s participation projects. This assessment serves as a benchmark for evaluating project success by 2027 and supports adjustments to the project and monitoring plans for the forthcoming season by AKRSPI and Lupin. While both project partners will conduct internal baselines using existing Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) systems, the objective is to deepen understanding of the current baseline situation and improve future monitoring activities. Additionally, the aim is to contribute to reﬁning the assessment of empowerment throughout project implementation. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Technical Approach 3.1 Study Approach The aim of the study is to conduct a baseline survey in Gujarat and Maharashtra across women cotton farmers to understand their degree of empowerment owing to the efforts of Lupin and AKRSP activities in the districts. Both the partners have a common objective of supporting women to increase their adoption of sustainable farming practices, increase their income and to impress upon the community the pivotal role played by women in farming. The baseline study will thoroughly evaluate women&amp;#x27;s empowerment, utilising methods beyond solely relying on women&amp;#x27;s self-reported feelings or decision-making through the conventional Likert scale, ensuring a more inclusive and detailed assessment, enabling women to express themselves fully without limitations. For this purpose, the study will use a mixed methods approach because it focuses on both quantitative data, such as changes in income and savings, and qualitative data, such as understanding their inﬂuence in decision-making in the ﬁeld. The proposed approach will follow a logical ﬂow - reviewing documents - problem statement, project objectives, etc., develop a Theory of Change, and capture the level of women empowerment through various participatory tools. The framework below lists down the tools that will be used in the baseline study, the drivers and barriers, along with recommendations and deliverables of the study. Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

As a ﬁrst step, CMS will ﬁrst review the programme partner logframe / MEL plans and any other existing project documents to gain clarity on the current baseline situation. If felt necessary, CMS will suggest areas of improvements / strengthening in the existing program monitoring processes. CMS has developed a program theory of change to gain a clear picture of how to achieve the program objectives and drive meaningful impact. It has been mentioned in the annexure . The study will commence only after understanding the program in depth and in consultation with the Better Cotton team approving the Theory of Change. Insights emerging from the quantitative and mainly qualitative data would be used to validate and establish the pathways of change that have been worked out. Development of Quantitative &amp;amp; Qualitative Tools: Given that the study will adopt a mixed methods approach, the tools developed will aim at capturing quantitative data and qualitative insights from the women farmers. For the quantitative survey, we will primarily use the indicators outlined in the Delta Women’s Empowerment tool for capturing data and insights on sustainability practices and income / productivity of women farmers. The KPIs listed in the program TOC have been developed keeping in view the indicators mentioned in the Delta Framework. During the questionnaire design process, utmost care will be taken to ensure that questions are framed in a manner that allows women to self-assess their empowerment, identify barriers, and recognize opportunities for empowerment. Additionally, the design will prioritise enabling women to freely express their feelings without being limited by the tool&amp;#x27;s constraints on word usage or any other factor. 3.2 Sampling Framework Having extensively conducted ﬁeld assignments in Maharashtra &amp;amp; Gujarat the data collection team at CMS (community engagement lead, supervisors and enumerators) are well-versed with the regional milieu and possess excellent written and verbal communication skills in Marathi and Gujarati besides English. The project will primarily involve the GIF-funded women, their partners / husbands / other family members, to gather their perspectives on the current status of women and their understanding of women&amp;#x27;s empowerment in farming practices, household income generation, decision-making authority, and leadership roles in larger organisations such as FPOs. The sampling strategy for quantitative and qualitative data collection is as below: Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 10 --- Page 11 --- Study Design 2 partners: AKRSPI &amp;amp; Lupin Survey Respondents: GIF-funded women farmers Geographic coverage: Gujarat (Morbe &amp;amp; Rajkot) - AKRSPI, Maharashtra (Dhule &amp;amp; Nandurbar) - Lupin Method of Sampling - Simple random sampling from the pool of GIF funded women Sampling Framework AKRSPI Lupin A. Quantitative Sampling Conﬁdence level 97% 97% Margin of Error 3% 3% Population proportion 50% 50% Population size (as given in ToR) 1000 550 Sample Size* 567 388 * The sample size will be distributed evenly across the two districts in the two states. Once the CMS team gets complete information about the villages, a detailed ﬁeld plan will be designed Although the ToR provided by BC speciﬁes the districts, they do not mention the study villages. CMS will select villages based on the high presence of women funded by GIF. During the village selection process, relevant indicators such as the presence of FPOs, adoption of sustainable farming practices by the farmers, etc. will be carefully considered to ensure we garner the information we are seeking for. B. Qualitative Sampling 1. FGDs 7 per district 7 per district 2. KIIs with representatives from the community 3 per district 3 per district 3. KII with husband or other family member of the participating women 5 per district 5 per district 3. Operational FPOs in the area Depending on the number of FPOs in the districts For the qualitative survey, we have identiﬁed the following stakeholders - 1) GIF funded women farmers; 2) Partners or other family members of GIF funded women farmers; Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 11 --- Page 12 --- 3) Key informant interviews (KIIs) with community members who can provide valuable insights into the local context, practices, and challenges. 4) Heads of operational FPOs in the village / district to get their views on women assuming leadership roles in their FPOs. Questions will be designed to get an understanding of the current baseline situation. Understanding the viewpoints of the family and community members surrounding empowered women is vital for gaining insights into the broader social dynamics and support systems that inﬂuence women&amp;#x27;s empowerment initiatives. By engaging with family members, CMS aims to create a holistic understanding of the context in which empowered women live, thereby strengthening our ability to suggest empowerment indicators for the study. During the FGDs / KIIs, CMS will capture case-studies, success stories and best practices. We understand that during the qualitative survey, the CMS&amp;#x27;s core team will be assisted with staff from Lupin and AKRSPI as rapport with local women and understanding of the local context will be needed. Additionally, it will also help the partner staff in understanding the conceptualisation of women empowerment and project indicators. Development of Data Collection Tools - Survey and interview tools would be developed by the CMS team and validated by the Better Cotton team as well as AKRSP and Lupin staff, before being deployed in the ﬁeld. The quantitative survey would be digitised on the SurveyCTO platform in Marathi, Gujarat, and English. CMS has a dedicated community engagement team, with qualiﬁed enumerators who would be responsible to administer the CAPI tool. They will be assisted with 2/3 researchers to ensure that the intended data is being captured appropriately. Pilot testing: After the digitization, the CAPI e-forms will be tested on the ﬁeld with 5-10 respondents. The ﬁeld enumerators who will do pilot testing will also be the part of the ﬁnal data collection team. The translated survey instrument will undergo extensive testing Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 12 --- Page 13 --- throughout the pilot phase to make sure that the questions have a logical ﬂow and response options, the translated questionnaires have the same meaning as the original questions and are easily comprehended by the respondents. The duration of the responses would also be tested during the pilot. The ﬁeld team&amp;#x27;s input on the aforementioned criteria will be reviewed with the GIF team during a post-pilot meeting, and any adjustments that are needed will be made after consulting with the team. 3.3 Data Analysis and Presentation of Findings The analytical framework would be focussed to capture the key narratives and drivers to establish the following: 1) Uptake of sustainable farming practices by women 2) Increase in their income levels 3) Improvement in community recognition of the pivotal role of women in farming We will achieve the above objectives through mixed methods analysis of quantitative and qualitative analytical approaches. ○ Quantitative analysis - The quantitative data collected at the farmer level will be analysed using advanced statistical tools such as STATA. All analyses will be carried out in stages. At ﬁrst, descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, quartile or decile distribution will be done along with frequency tables to measure KPIs. Then as a second step, causality would be established using evaluation methods as relevant to the methodology adopted for this evaluation. This will provide impact estimates for the program. ○ Qualitative analysis - The qualitative interactions (FGDs / KIIs) and ﬁeld observations would provide insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. We will prepare thematic coding to identify patterns in data and draw narratives that can be used to triangulate the inferences gathered from the analysis of the quantitative data. The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the KIIs using software such as Nvivo or Atlas. ti. ○ Systems and documentation review: The role of ﬁdelity and process adherence would be reviewed against set SoPs, documents, reported and unreported information. They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. ○ These qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. Qualitative data can consist of interview notes, transcripts, participant observation ﬁeld notes etc. We will prepare thematic coding to identify patterns in data.

A critical review of the Theory of Change will allow us to identify the Causal Assumptions and Implementation assumptions . This will be critical to capture key aspects that would challenge the program’s success and failure. 3.4 Endline Evaluation Methodology In the endline assessment, we will analyse the indicators identiﬁed in the baseline study to determine changes over time and assess attribution and contribution. Additionally, we will examine external factors, including enablers and barriers, that may have inﬂuenced outcomes. Recommendations for sustainability and scalability, along with strategies for mitigating external factors, will be crucial. We will adhere to a similar analytical framework as used in the baseline study. The ToC will be evaluated by CMS to ascertain its effectiveness, including the validity of causal and implementation assumptions and whether the identiﬁed problem statement has been effectively addressed. 4. Timetable/implementation plan Based on the overall scope of work, a work plan is developed. The study will be rolled out in six stages: Stage 1: Inception Meeting - In the inception meeting, CMS will discuss the planned study design with the programme partners and Better Cotton. Accordingly, CMS’s core team and expert/knowledge partners would conduct a comprehensive desk review of the project and other documents and develop the ﬁeld visit plan, overall study framework and methods. Stage 2: Detailed methodology, Inception report and Presentation – Planning discussions will be carried out with the GIF team regarding logistics, resource availability and facilitation for the planned ﬁeld visits. Based on these, an inception report would be submitted for the planned baseline study with the study approach, proposed methodology and sampling plans and a detailed data collection plan - training of enumerators, piloting, sequence of activities (including list of interviews, focus group discussions, etc. and the ﬁeld visit plan), tools. Stage 3: Survey instruments development – Two weeks will be utilised for the development of study instruments, questionnaire design and ﬁeld team induction and training. Once the tools have been designed, the ﬁnalisation of the framework and survey Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 14 --- Page 15 --- operations will be done with the GIF team. CMS will furnish completed tools and make required modiﬁcations. Stage 4: Analysis of quantitative &amp;amp; Qualitative data - Post the ﬁeld data collection a comprehensive process of data cleaning along with data preparation and warehousing would happen. During this phase, a dedicated data analysis team of experts will be involved and coordinating the data handling aspects from the CMS team. Analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team and discussions with the project team will take place. During this period, dedicated two consultations with the project team is expected. Post the data cleaning activity, data analysis will be front ended by the data analysis team in STATA according to the agreed speciﬁcations and outputs. Finalised data sets and codebook after quality veriﬁcation and responses to queries will be submitted as a deliverable during this stage. Based on preliminary analysis of quantitative data, a questionnaire for qualitative data collection will be developed. Post tool development, FGDs will be carried out to collect qualitative data. Stage 5: Draft baseline study report &amp;amp; presentation on topline ﬁndings : Provide a presentation to the team on the high-level ﬁndings on completion of ﬁeld visits with analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team. A draft report will be submitted to Better Cotton, Lupin and AKRSPI for review and feedback. Stage 5: Analysis, Final Report, Presentation &amp;amp; Datasets: Comments from Better Cotton and key stakeholders will be incorporated into the report and presentation. At this stage a ﬁnal report and a presentation of the ﬁndings will be given to the Better Cotton team. The Final report would be concise and will be structured around following sections: ● List of acronyms and abbreviations ● Table of contents ● Executive summary ● Introduction ● Methodology, Field plan, Sampling Strategy ● Findings and discussions ● Conclusion and recommendations ● Proposed Indicators for the Projects ● Annexures- Survey instruments: questionnaires, interview guides, maps, graphics, etc. as applicable Along with the report and presentation, a cleaned and coded primary data (including qualitative transcripts) and all the other data collected during the study will be submitted to Better Cotton.

Conﬁdentiality and Ethical Considerations Ensuring anonymity and protecting respondent identity is a mandatory requirement, and our organisation adheres to stringent protocols for maintaining the highest level of conﬁdentiality. We have implemented robust measures to safeguard data security and privacy across our digital tools and platforms, including encryption of survey forms and clear guidelines for enumerators on data sharing, accompanied by conﬁdentiality contracts. Our enumerators undergo comprehensive training to remain unbiased and refrain from sharing any personal opinions, claims, or identifying information. They are bound by a conﬁdentiality agreement with CMS, committing to the proper use of conﬁdential information solely for the designated purposes outlined in their training, and not disclosing it to any third party. Additionally, our enumerators are instructed not to copy, retain, or share any written information that could potentially reveal identifying features of individuals, and all conﬁdential information, such as questionnaires, notes, photographs, and memoranda, is handed over to the team upon the conclusion of the surveys. 7. Quality Control Mechanism With over 200 projects and an in-house portfolio for data collection, CMS has strong expertise in ensuring quality data collection and follows strong protocols in the data collection process. This becomes especially relevant in the post pandemic scenario wherein the team has been following stringent guidelines around safety and hygiene, following international standards. After the questionnaire is ﬁnalised in consultation with the GIF team , researchers from the CMS team will conduct a pilot in the ﬁeld to ensure that the tool is well tailored to the location, project context as well as a cultural point of view. Once the post-pilot changes are completed, the tool is scripted and tested in-house (for skips and validations) by researchers and tested in a setting similar to that of the intended sample. Th e ﬁnal questionnaire is translated into local language by experienced thematic translators to retain the essence and yet contextualise for the local language. Translated tools undergo a proofreading exercise to check the consistency and accuracy of the translation by the research team who is well versed in local languages. Monitoring of data quality is the most important aspect of data collection. Poor quality data reduces the effectiveness of policy intervention, and can also require a repeat of the entire data collection process. Therefore, the research team sets clear guidelines and protocols for the monitoring and quality assurance that include maintaining a real-time MIS dashboard of collection, minimising non-response with 2-3 attempts, ensuring enumerator quality Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 17 --- Page 18 --- controls with spot checks, back checks (on major topics, time taken, etc.) and looping mechanisms. Data management is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect in the data collection process. The CMS team has robust processes, the quantitative data is stored online on secured servers synched in real-time that ensure data security. All hard copies of the research notes, qualitative interviews, etc. are scanned and uploaded almost in real-time to avoid any loss of data. The research team has strong experience in working with multiple scripting software such as Survey CTO, Commcare, ODK, etc. and experience in online data management. Data cleaning is perhaps the most critical step between data collection and data analysis. CMS believes that it is a rigorous process, and that the quality of the analysis is correlated to the quality of data cleaning. Most of the data validation exercise is completed in real-time to avoid post-cleaning efforts including id variable checking, outlier tagging, missing values and replacements, illogical value assessment, addressing typos, survey codes, missing values and adding labels. Irregularities and corrections are identiﬁed and documented, but changes are made only after introspection with the ﬁeld team and the qualitative insights. 8. Selection of Interviewers/Enumerators and their Training CMS has an expert network of senior enumerators Pan India with strong domain knowledge and past experience of working on assessment of Education related impact assessment projects. They are also trained on research ethics and the collection of sensitive information, etc. The selection of enumerators is based on stringent measures, and they are assessed for quality throughout the project. A detailed training and orienting process is designed at multiple levels, including the training of trainers. Training is provided on all aspects of data collection including programme background, objectives and scope of the study, sampling techniques and replacement methodology, discussion on each question with probing methods, logistics planning and support. A scientiﬁc approach to the training process is ensured by creating standard training protocols, manuals including standardisation in survey techniques. Key personnel including members of the research and ﬁeld supervisory team are present to enable the highest quality of data collection. Mock surveys and ﬁeld days are planned for the team for in-ﬁeld experience with the software and survey tool. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Annexures 10.1. Detailed List of Past Assignments Baseline evaluation of Weavers community in Andhra and Telangana of the “3ie-Swashakt Evaluation (Chitrika)” (2021-22) The 3ie-Swashakt Evaluation (Chitrika) focused on data collection and was conducted by CMS. The objective of this baseline evaluation, carried out in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana during 2021-22, was to assess the Weavers community, encompassing a total of 3000 weavers. In the initial phase, a comprehensive listing of 6000 weaving women across six clusters in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana was undertaken in 2021. The assignment&amp;#x27;s overarching goal was to generate empirical evidence on the potential of women&amp;#x27;s collective enterprises in enhancing women&amp;#x27;s economic empowerment in India. The methodology employed for this evaluation was a quantitative study, involving various components such as listing (7480), household survey (2905), women&amp;#x27;s survey (2785), and the creation of village proﬁles (65). The entire process was overseen by CMS to ensure robust and reliable data collection. Baseline study for establishing current status of both short term and long-term indicators of the “AgroForestry (Wadi) Project” in Dharampur (Valsad) (May - December 2021) The study focused on conducting a baseline study for the &amp;quot;AgroForestry (Wadi) Project&amp;#x27;&amp;#x27; in Dharampur block, Valsad district, aiming to cover 1000 Agro Forestry (Wadi) families from November 2020 to October 2023.

    <Content>Health Initiative Concept Note Join the Movement for Health Equity Your partnership can prevent millions of families from slipping into poverty due to out-of-pocket health expenses. Together, we can create a future where equitable, accessible healthcare is a reality for all. The Mission: [X] Million Healthy Days by [Target Year] Our alliance is on a transformative mission to add [X] million Healthy Days to vulnerable communities by [Target Year]. This mission aims to improve health outcomes for millions through people-centered, tech-enabled comprehensive primary healthcare solutions at the community doorstep. Our combined expertise in health innovations and scalable interventions positions us to lead transformative healthcare efforts. The alliance is a transformative coalition of multidimensional actors working together to rally around public health outcomes. Built on the [Framework] (&amp;#x27;Learn, Act, Connect and Solve&amp;#x27;), this ensures accessible and equitable healthcare for underserved populations globally. Guided by the vision of a &amp;#x27;healthier future for all&amp;#x27; and striving to remove barriers to quality health care, ensuring everyone has a &amp;#x27;right to live a healthy life&amp;#x27;. The Challenge: Bridging Health Gaps Healthcare inequities continue to widen, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations with limited access to timely, affordable, and quality care. The growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), high out-of-pocket expenditures, and gaps in healthcare access have intensified disparities, making comprehensive primary healthcare more critical than ever. Rationale Rising Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs): NCDs like hypertension, diabetes, and heart diseases account for over 60% of all deaths in the target region Globally, NCDs cause millions of deaths annually, with many premature deaths occurring before age 70 Financial Hardship: Millions are pushed into poverty annually due to healthcare costs Access Barriers: Gaps in preventive care, health literacy, and quality primary healthcare services Health is a Low or No Priority: Ignorance and poor awareness among communities lead to neglect of preventive care and delayed health-seeking behavior This initiative aligns with national health priorities and reinforces Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by integrating preventive healthcare with sustainable financing models. Key Strategic Approach: Our model integrates community-led action with technology-enabled solutions: Community Centricity: Ensures placing people at the center, addressing root causes and social determinants of health to enhance health outcomes Community-Led: Mobilizes local organizations and health workers for education, screenings, referrals, and sustained engagement Technology-Enabled: Utilizes AI-powered digital tools for real-time risk assessment, diagnostics, patient tracking and data-driven healthcare outcomes Health Workforce Skilling: Trains frontline health workers to deliver screenings, counseling, and treatment adherence support Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI): Our healthcare model integrates CQI with Miller&amp;#x27;s Prism of Clinical Competence to help healthcare workers develop, apply, and refine their skills for quality care Partnerships for Scale: Leverages collaborations with public and private healthcare providers, NGOs, CBOs, and funders Our Response: Delivering Comprehensive Primary Healthcare We offer a transformative, people-centered approach that moves beyond episodic care to early detection, prevention, disease management, and health security. Our response includes: Early Detection &amp;amp; Preventive Care: Risk assessments, screenings for NCDs, and health education via onsite and e-learning Primary Healthcare Treatment: Continuum of care through AI/IoT platforms, offering localized follow-ups and treatment support Access to Secondary/Tertiary Care: Refer community members who are at risk to local health care facilities, reducing financial barriers through connections to government health insurance schemes Community Health Education: Awareness sessions on NCD management, lifestyle changes, and regular health check-ups Access to Health Products: Linkages to insurance, nutrition programs, and essential health supplies Communities We Focus On We work with communities from low socio-economic backgrounds, including urban and rural areas, informal migrant and garment workers, indigenous communities, and other marginalized groups. Our goal is to serve [X] million people annually. We are equipped to implement our programs across multiple regions leveraging the presence of our partners on the ground. Goal &amp;amp; Outcomes We Aim to Achieve Our goal is to serve [X] million people annually, creating scalable models that strengthen grassroots health systems with [X] Million Healthy Days added to vulnerable communities by [Target Year]. Measurable Outcomes Are: Increased Early Detection of high-burden diseases Improved Treatment Adherence via follow-ups and personalized care plans Enhanced Health Literacy to promote preventive health practices Reduced Out-of-Pocket Expenditures through insurance linkages Scalable Impact via technology-driven healthcare delivery Investment Opportunity: High Impact, Cost-Effective The cost to deliver primary healthcare is approximately $[X] per person annually, with capacity to reach up to [X] million individuals annually. Donors will have flexible investment options based on the number of beneficiaries they intend to support, and multiple donors can co-invest for collective ownership of outcomes. Donors can support specific regions or population groups, maximizing their impact alongside other like-minded partners. Why Partner with Us? Direct Impact: Reach underserved individuals to add [X] million Healthy Days to communities Global Alignment: Advance SDG 3 (Good Health &amp;amp; Well-being) and Universal Health Coverage goals Leadership Visibility: Be recognized as a champion for equitable, people-centered healthcare Your investment isn&amp;#x27;t just funding a program—it&amp;#x27;s creating a healthier, more equitable future for millions. Join us in adding [X] million Healthy Days to vulnerable lives by [Target Year]. Canvas of Actors These partnerships are powered by a comprehensive healthcare alliance. The key roles and competencies include: [Partner Organization A]: Leverages decades of expertise in people-centered health solutions, health system strengthening, and human resource development to drive impactful health outcomes at scale [Technology Partner]: Powers the mission with cutting-edge technology, including an IoT-enabled, AI-driven digital healthcare platform for efficient, data-driven care [Implementation Partners]: Delivers end-to-end primary health care across multiple regions using their scale capabilities [Community Partner]: Leads community mobilization and community engagement to deliver primary health care, with hundreds of organizations across the region [Healthcare Network Partners]: Assisting patients to secure cashless hospital admissions &amp;amp; treatments through government health insurance schemes via a network of hospitals Together, we can address systemic health inequities, strengthen health systems, and deliver comprehensive primary healthcare to underserved populations.</Content>

Conceptual framework for baseline study 1.1 Finalisation of the evaluation and analytical framework CMS approached the baseline study by developing a detailed approach on methodology will be utilised, including qualitative and quantitative data collection approaches, sampling strategy, data collection methods and systems/technology to use, ﬁeld procedures, quality control practices and data analysis. The evaluation and the analytical framework for the baseline study was extracted from the programme design framework tools developed by [Client Organization], i.e., the programme Results framework (RF), [Client Organization] FPO Business Transformation Model (BTM) and Living Income Benchmark (LIB). Since the baseline study results and insights will be utilized to streamline the intervention design and the methodology for the intervention delivery, it is critical to overlay the evaluation approach on the programme design frameworks and extract functional indicator measurement framework. As a precursor to this process, the approach has been to establish and document the base values of the project’s indicators in relation to the objectives and impact areas. CMS developed an IPP indicator map and possible targets for each Result level indicators are tracked through different tool and corresponding mixed method approach has been established in this process. Some of the indicators are transferable and can be integrated with the project MEL Plan with the baseline results and possible targets for each Result level indicator through the coming years of the project.

The quantitative research tools of Farmers’ household structured survey and the FPO structured survey were reviewed with the conceptual framework as shown in the previous section. The CMS team utilised the conceptual framework for the evaluation to review their gaps against RF and BTM. Subsequently, the CMS, WAASAN team and poultry experts have reviewed both the tools in terms of indicator effectiveness, capturing process efﬁciency, inclusion of BYP aspects relevant for the study, application of local market knowledge on four districts and other socio economic and cultural aspects to improve baseline study. The suggested version of the survey has been shared with the HPI team, post facto, the HPI team has ﬁnalised the survey. The corresponding survey CTO form of Farmer Farmers’ household structured survey with all the suggested changes is yet to be shared by [Client Organization] post which the translations needs to be incorporated as well. The beneﬁciary list for farmers’ household survey has been shared for two districts (Nellore and Anantapur districts) and yet to be shared for two-East Godavari and Krishna districts. In the context of the FPO structured survey, HPI is in the process of incorporating all the suggested changes post which the survey needs to be digitised in the SurveyCTO and translations needs to be incorporated as well. In the context of the MSME Key Informant Interview tool, the MSME framework has been shared by HPI with the CMS along with poultry experts. The deﬁnition and understanding of MSMEs in the context of HPI’s PIRS has been clariﬁed and internally CMS along with poultry experts have reviewed the framework. CMS team has developed a questionnaire-MSME Key Informant Interview for multiple stakeholders. This tool is in the process of getting approved by the HPI team post which HPI team would translate and digitise the tool in SurveyCTO for the process of deployment in the ﬁeld. In the context of the following tools, ● FGD with FPO/Non-FPO ● Market Survey-LIB - Key Informant Interview ● FGD with community We are awaiting the draft instruments to be shared by the HPI team. Once the instruments have been provided, the CMS team will review with the conceptual framework as shown in the previous section. The CMS team would utilise the Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 11 --- Page 12 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report conceptual framework for the evaluation to review their gaps against RF, LIB and BTM.

Sampling and Workplan 4.1 Sampling F ARMERS ’ HOUSEHOLD STRUCTURED SURVEY SAMPLING APPROACH The overall approaching for HH sampling is as follows: ● The sampling frame would be 16 FPOs covering around 800 HHs in total. ● The sample size would be 50 HHs per FPO. ● The control in sampling would be for women representation where the proportion of women in the sample per FPO would be in the same proportion as in the raw data shared, these proportions are indicated in table 1 below. H OUSEHOLD SURVEY SAMPLING PROCESS : The sampling plan detailed below provides an outline of the process with which the households were sampled. ● The sampling frame of eight FPOs from Nellore and Anantapur districts was used for sampling. ● A purposive sampling technique was used for the selection of 50 households from each FPO. ● The ﬁnal list of households that would be sampled for the study, will be randomly selected from the household sampling frame. ● Villages with the concentrated member base were considered the purposive sampling of households within each FPO. ● As indicated in the approach the proportion of women in the sample was ensured to be the same as that of the population. The household entries with missing gender information were removed, post the same the proportion of women members for each FPO is as follows. S. No. Name of the District Name of the FPOs Women Proportion (in % of total members) 1 Anantapur Narpala Banana FPCL 20.81% 2 Anantapur Bukkapattanam Mango FPCL 15.57% 3 Anantapur Tanakallu Vegetables FPCL 40.70% 4 Anantapur Rolla Vegetables FPCL 8.57% Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt.

Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 22 --- Page 23 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report 5. Data Collection and Quality Assurance Ensuring a good quality assurance of the ﬁeld survey will go a long way in ensuring high quality data. The quality assurance of the ﬁeld research will be ensured through the following process: ● Detailed overall planning for ﬁeld work, which will be monitored closely, every day, in terms of survey tasks planned, survey tasks achieved and variance. ● Each interview will be tracked via GPS location, which will be automated and done for all the interviews. ● Spot-check visits – Random and unannounced visits will be done by the State Coordinators and Supervisors to the ﬁeld location of each ﬁeld team to cross-check the accuracy and completeness of data. This will also be an opportunity to do the following: ● Check if the ﬁeld investigator interviewed the correct, desired and intended respondents. ● Obtain information from the household members on whether a reported visit (by the ﬁeld investigator) was indeed made. ● Find out about the ﬁeld investigator’s conduct during visits. ● Discuss any concerns of community (Registered/ sample/target population) during the process of ﬁeld work ● Verify events that have been reported by the ﬁeld investigator. ● Back-Check - The back-check will be done by the Supervisors. The interviewees will be contacted telephonically and at least 5% of the key indicators will be checked for their authenticity and accuracy. This will also be done randomly for each Field Research team. ● Monitoring Refusals - Number of refusals to participate in the survey and reasons will be tracked and monitored closely. Number of visits done to each household will also be monitored and documented. Considering the prevailing scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, enumerators will be provided with the PPE kits to ensure the safety of both, the respondent and enumerator. 5.1 Data Entry and Management Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) using handheld tablets will be used for data collection during the survey. CMS has more than 300 android tablets which will be deployed for the data collection as and when needed. SurveyCTO will be used for data collection. SurveyCTO is a data collection platform that enables anyone to build applications for data collection, both desktop and tablet/mobile based. SurveyCTO is Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 23 --- Page 24 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report one of the most widely adopted, technically advanced, and evidence-based mobile platforms for low-resource settings. The key features include: ● Create a custom app ● Collect information ofﬂine ● Track data over-time ● Support complex workﬂows ● Data stored on secure cloud server ● Access real-time reports ● Vernacular Forms ● Validations and logic ﬂows ● Easy monitoring and reporting of data Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 24 --- Page 25 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report 6. Quality assurance Data collection is an important component of evaluation and it is necessary that the data collected be accurate and of optimum quality. The process for collecting this data should also be efﬁcient in terms of time and costs. The process of data collection can be divided into multiple stages as shown below. The agency will establish the following mechanisms at each of the levels to ensure that the data collected is quality ensured: 6.1 Before data collection 1. Tool designing with validations and skip logic (Shared by HPI) 2. Translation - The tool will be translated in Telugu. After getting approval of the team, the tool will be translated into the required regional languages based on the scope of the study by the [Client Organization] team. Translated tools undergo a proofreading exercise for checking the consistency and accuracy of the translation. The language in the questionnaire needs to be as accurate as possible to avoid confusion or misunderstanding. 3. Designing the tool with validations, skip logics and including Telugu translations in Survey CTO. 4. Recruiting, Training and Piloting a. Recruitment - The experienced ﬁeld researchers with domain knowledge are selected within the pool of trained and ethical certiﬁed enumerators from the Community Engagement unit of CMS. Depending upon the stakeholder gender proportion a corresponding ratio of male and female enumerators will be used for this study. The team will be driven by the Senior Supervisor and Monitored by the Field Manager of South Zone. b. Training - Core research team along with domain expert and south zone supervisor will be heading the Field staff training. Training would entail information on project background, introduction of partners, Objective of the baseline survey, Survey Protocols and Process, Quality of Data, Sampling method, Replacement strategy for drop-out/denials, selection of the right respondent, probing methods, and time frame. The identiﬁed ﬁeld investigators and supervisors will be trained on the ﬁnal tool. The teams will then be trained on administering the tool using CAPI. Two days in-house training with mock drills followed by a practical exposure to a sample village to get the better hold on the tools and data quality. Review and hand holding support will be carried out after practical exposure. HPI team could participate in training the enumerators and provide relevant inputs. Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 25 --- Page 26 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report c. Mock surveys - After the training is completed, mock surveys will be conducted within the team. This helps identify the areas that need training and also provide handholding support to the FIs and FSs. This will also help enumerators get hands-on training of the CAPI application d. Pilot - The core ﬁeld research team will be oriented on the project background, objectives, sample and pilot villages in discussion with local partners. CAPI orientation will be provided before moving for the pilot. Two researchers will go to a village as discussed and agreed with a local partner and conduct the pilot of 5 samples and prepare the feedback and experience. The pilot experiences and feedback on survey tools shared for further action. 5. Post pilot changes feedback and changes incorporated in the design of the ﬁnal tool in SurveyCTO. The tool will be frozen for data collection. 6. The ﬁeld work will be initiated after a few days onward in sample districts/Villages. First day data will be submitted to the Analyst and Quality controller to give feedback on data quality. Any discrepancies will be addressed before going for the next phase of data collection. Field work carried out to complete the sample as per sampling framework is shared. 6.2 During data collection 1. Monitoring during data collection a. FI wise target vs completion - In a time-bound survey of this nature, it is important to set targets for each of the ﬁeld investigator and supervisor and to ensure that these targets are being met regularly. The proposed CAPI will capture this and will show the progress at each level (FI, FS, Location). b. Average time taken - Based on the results of the paper-based pilots and the pilots undertaken using the CAPI designed, average time to be taken for each section and the tool will be identiﬁed. Analytics will be available ﬁeld investigator wise which can be compared against the standard set. This will help identify investigators who need support. c. Back check forms - Smaller forms can be designed on top of the existing tool as the back-check form. These forms will be synced to the original form through unique question labels and household ID. 5% of the respondents will be sampled randomly from each ﬁeld investigator. Back check will be done using these forms and through telephonic interviews. Data on the following will be collected: ● Conﬁrmation of ﬁeld work carried out ● Conﬁrmation of the time taken to conduct the interview ● Response on key indicators ● Feedback on the process of data collection Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 26 --- Page 27 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report Detailed documentation will be maintained of the quality checks done on the ﬁeld. The errors that arise on the ﬁeld can be categorized into the following: 1. Need for retraining on using and understanding the tool. 2. Need for retraining on using CAPI. 3. Need for retraining on asking and probing the questions in the most accurate and appropriate way. 4. Ethical issues like fudging data etc. Based on the severity of the error, either retraining and handholding support will be provided through ﬁeld supervisors. In case of ethical issues or misappropriation of data, the ﬁeld investigator will be terminated, and the data so collected by him will be re-collected by replacement team members. ● Back check forms analysis - Data collected using the back-check forms will be analysed and available ﬁeld investigator wise to monitor the quality of data collection. ● Spot check - As ﬁeld investigators operate with a high degree of independence and ﬂexibility, random and unannounced spot check visits will be used to check on data collection activities. The following will be the key observation parameters: A. Methods of asking questions and probing B. Method of recording the responses in the CAPI being used C. Attitude of interacting with the members Spot checks or accompanying checks will be done by the supervisor per day to ensure the quality of data collection. A total of 5% of spot checks will be done. 6.3 Post data collection 1. Download data - Data synced on the tablets will be available on the server and will be accessible to all the admin users. The data can be downloaded in a CSV or excel format. Back-up of the data will be taken as ofﬂine downloaded ﬁles every day to ensure that data is available for audit and analysis as and when needed. 2. Check for outliers - The ﬁnal data downloaded will be tested for outliers, redundancies and inconsistencies. 3. Check for crosstabs - Data will be tested for internal validity as well before submission. Cross tabulations will be done between variables across different sections and different questions to ensure that the data is valid as per the predeﬁned rules. 4. Preliminary analysis - Downloaded data will be analysed weekly on the following parameters: I. Using timestamp to look at the number of interviews per day against the reported data II. % of no response and do not know in key questions Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 27 --- Page 28 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report III. Average time taken between sections and for the entire tool Any discrepancies so found will be deleted from the original dataset. In order to ensure transparency, all the deleted records will also be shared as a separate ﬁle. SurveyCTO will be used for data collection. 6.4 Data Analysis The quantitative analysis will be carried out using advanced statistical tools from STATA /SPSS/Microsoft Excel. The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the FGDs, KIIs and participatory activities with different stakeholders. Q UANTITATIVE ANALYSIS 1. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode will be widely used along with frequency tables. 2. Inferential statistics such as cross-tabulation (or crosstab) tables show the relationships among survey variables in a summarized matrix display. 3. Trying to establish correlation between project indicators and other inﬂuencing factors. Qualitative tools will be developed post preliminary analysis of the quantitative data in collaboration with the [Client Organization] team for LIB calculations. Literature and case studies developed from the ﬁndings of FGDs and surveys will provide in-depth details into the processes, the efﬁciency of processes, and help in establishing the base levels for result indicators. The study is aiming to present strong quantitative analysis, within data limitations, that clearly addresses key issues found in the evaluation questions, such as the direct and indirect impact of the intervention model. The cross tabulation would be identiﬁed as per the given frameworks and indicators mentioned in the quantitative assessments from both the Farmers’ household structured survey and FPO structured survey. In the ﬁeld survey, if there are any speciﬁc co-relations for cross tabulations then they would be identiﬁed and analysed accordingly. The quantitative analysis would be reviewed in the respective frameworks-BTM, RF and other key indicators mentioned in the All_PIRS Comparison Chart. The report will be prepared post qualitative analysis. Qualitative ﬁndings from FGDs will help strengthen and explain quantitative ﬁndings. The case studies would be developed in parallel with the key success stories and aspirational BYP in the decided locations Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 28 --- Page 29 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report 7. Anticipated Risks and Mitigation plan The risks that are anticipated at this stage are mentioned below: 1. A small proportion of the CAPI devices usually face technical issues (blanking of screen, keyboard issues, etc.) daily. For small errors, these devices will be rectiﬁed in the ﬁeld with the help from the supervisor personnel, who will provide instructions over telephone using toll free numbers. In case a device is irreparable, the device will be replaced. 2. CAPI based surveys are usually not conducted in areas affected by political unrest. There is always the risk of teams being kidnapped and the devices being retained or conﬁscated by local stakeholders. Careful planning will be undertaken along with the Olam team to protect the teams and the devices while survey is on-going in these areas. At, CMS we have insurance coverage for full time employees. Networking consultants are having their own personal insurance plans and we are not responsible for that. However, any unforeseen incidents happen during ﬁeld work, organisation support the network consultants/part-time employees. 3. Drop-out of trained interviewers – especially due to illness – is always a risk. Extra enumerators will be recruited before training to replace in case of dropouts. The Covid19 situation may exacerbate the situation, but we will recruit additional interviewers for this. 4. While the unlock 5 guidelines say that no restrictions apply on any economic activity, any change in government advisory might delay the timelines. Also travel within containment zones may not be possible. We have recruited local staff to avoid intra-state, intra-district travel but if any of the villages/respondents come in a containment zone, it could lead to delays and higher non-response could be anticipated. We will need additional replacement samples as a mitigating strategy. 7.1 Counterpart (HPI) Support [Client Organization] Baseline Data collection is a time bound study with 4 months as an outside limit. It is important that all preparatory activities happen in a planned manner. As the study involves physical surveys during the COVID-19 times, it is crucial that the inputs from [Client Organization] and implementing partners are timely in order to meet the deadlines. The following support is expected: 1. Sample details for farmers including address (GP, block and village details with exact address for each of the farmers. Accurate phone numbers for the sample. 2. Supporting letter from [Client Organization] for CMS team for visiting the ﬁeld on behalf of [Client Organization] and collecting data for the project. Catalyst Manag emen t Services Pvt. Ltd. ( https://cms.org.in/ ) 29 --- Page 30 --- HPI-BL-Incep tion Report 3. Introducing CMS to local partners. With the support of a local client, an introductory meet or call will be set up between the research agency (CMS) and the local implementing partner. This call will be facilitated by the programme team and it will help in building a good rapport with the respondent. The introductory call will provide background about the research agency (CMS); who we are (organisation and individual), purpose and objectives of the study; and what are the expectations from them. This also provides local context and exceptions to be kept in mind while visiting the ﬁeld. 4. Ground Support team from the implementing team in the treatment villages for troubleshooting and introduction/rapport building with the program farmers. Supporting the ﬁeld team in identiﬁcation of control villages and farmers as and when needed. 5. Any other information and support that will be crucial to ﬁeld data collection and analysis. 6. For the ﬁeld team to conduct data collection exercises in a timely fashion, the programme team in each district/block would need to be informed about the ﬁeld plan and support needed from them. Lastly, the study team would request for timely feedback on progress of work so that course correction can be implemented, and study objectives be achieved as intended.

Steps in applying Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) and obtaining the sample list 1. Calculate the sample size for each strata. Strata: Panchkula; Yamunanagar; Gurugram; Sample size = 30 2. Separate population data into strata. The following steps will have to be applied for each strata. --- Page 6 --- 3. List the primary sampling units (Schools) and their population sizes (Number of schools). Each School has its own Cluster Population Size. Primary sampling units (Schools): Panchkula; Yamuna nagar; Gurugram Population Size (Total Number of Schools): Panchkula = 113; Yamuna Nagar = 276; Gurugram = 183 4. Calculate the cumulative sum of the population sizes. The Total Population will be the cumulative sum of the enrollment. Total Population Size (Cumulative number of enrollment): Panchkula = 18345; Yamuna Nagar = 26600; Gurugram = 40061 5. Determine the Number of Clusters that will be sampled. Number of clusters = 30 6. Determine the Number of Individuals to be sampled from each school. In order to ensure that all individuals in the population have the same probability of selection irrespective of the size of their cluster, the same number of individuals has to be sampled from each school. Number of Individuals to be sampled from each school = 40 7. Divide the total population by the number of clusters to be sampled, to get the Sampling Interval (SI). Sampling Interval (SI): Panchkula = 18345/30; Yamuna Nagar = 26600/30; Gurugram = 40061/30 8. Choose a random number between 1 and the SI. This is the Random Start (RS). The first cluster to be sampled contains this cumulative population. [Excel command =rand()*SI] Random Start (RS): Panchkula = 429; Yamuna Nagar = 570; Gurugram = 616 9. Calculate the following series: RS; RS + SI; RS + 2SI; … . RS+(d-1)*SI.

Please send the filled in and signed form to Aparna Suresh (aparna@catalysts.org) BASIC DATA AIM OF THE STUDY 2.1. Goal: This study aims to explore the nuanced interplay between the delivery of and access to health services like routine immunization and climate-related events such as floods, droughts, heat waves, etc., and how it exacerbates existing inequities among most vulnerable populations in three South-East Asian countries- Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. 2.2 Objectives: To identify and explore the factors associated with vaccination inequities among vulnerable populations in 3 south asian countries - cambodia, philippines and India To explore in detail the role of climate change in exacerbating vaccine inequities among vulnerable populations. To map the ongoing strategies and coping mechanisms adopted by the system and individuals to cope with the effects of climate. BACKGROUND 3.1 Give (in 100-200 words) enough background information to explain why your study needs to be done/ its relevance. The impact of climate change is multifaceted and poses significant challenges across various sectors. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events contribute to adverse effects on agriculture, water resources, and public health among nations worldwide and have a greater impact on populations who are vulnerable, and are otherwise disadvantaged due to socio-cultural and geographic factors(1). The variability in climate conditions further exacerbates challenges in healthcare delivery, including routine immunization, as extreme weather events disrupt infrastructure and create logistical hurdles(2). Recognizing the broader implications of climate change on these nations is crucial for developing adaptive strategies, resilient healthcare systems, and sustainable development practices to mitigate the far-reaching consequences on the environment, economy, and public health. Understanding the intricate relationship between climate-related events and the delivery of and access to health services, particularly routine immunization, is imperative for designing effective and equitable public health interventions. The Rockefeller Foundation’s Global Vaccination Initiative (GVI) addresses these challenges by supporting efforts to increase vaccination demand and strengthen health systems in vulnerable regions such as Assam and Chhattisgarh, India, as well as the Philippines and Cambodia. This initiative focuses on overcoming barriers to vaccination, including access, trust, and information. By leveraging both traditional and innovative data sources, GVI aims to create adaptive, resilient health systems capable of responding to future public health crises. This multi-country study will explore the vulnerabilities of communities and health systems, emphasizing the need for resilience, adaptability, and targeted interventions. STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Briefly describe the population groups included in the activity/study (examples: male/female, age group adolescent/adult etc.) Since the study aims to understand the relationship between climate change and existing inequities among different vulnerable groups, a cross-sectional mixed methods approach will be used. The quantitative surveys will be conducted with individuals who are primary beneficiaries of vaccination as well as caretakers of primary beneficiaries. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted with key stakeholders like healthcare professionals, frontline workers, policymakers, and community representatives from different geographical regions within Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. To ensure diverse representation, the sample will be stratified, taking into account various climatic zones and healthcare settings. 4.2 Briefly describe how the participants will be recruited into the study Participants for the study will be recruited from three southeast regions: Cambodia, the Philippines, and India employing a comprehensive stratified random sampling approach. The various strata identified for participant selection include riverbank villages, migrated populations, tribal communities, encompassing groups with distinct cultural and social identities; indigenous populations, reflecting the native inhabitants of the regions; geographically isolated areas. The recruitment of respondents will be done through civil society organisations who have been working closely with vulnerable populations facilitating access to various healthcare for the most marginalised. By leveraging their extensive knowledge on the inequities and current situation on the ground as well their relationship with the different stakeholders like healthcare providers, government entities, etc. the participants will be enrolled into the study. Those participants who are beneficiaries of vaccination programs in the country, who are above the age of 18 as well as willing to participate in the study will be enrolled from the community side. For the stakeholder interviews, using a snowballing technique, those who can give critical insights into the existing inequities, climate change, as well as the systemic and community coping mechanisms, etc. will be invited to be part of the study. The interviews will be conducted till there is maximum saturation of information from diverse stakeholders. To ensure a seamless process, the participants of key stakeholder interviews will be informed of the study timings well in advance, allowing for a smooth integration into their daily routines without causing disruptions. SAMPLING 5.1. What sample size calculations were done to determine the number of subjects? Surveys: In the calculation of population size for the study, various parameters and values were considered, focusing specifically on climate-related aspects and their impact on subgroups such as river bank villages and tribal communities. The estimation of population proportion with a precision level set at 5% involved employing the formula for the standard error of a proportion. The estimated sample sizes such as 384 for India, 385 for Cambodia, and 384 for the Philippines are intended to provide a statistically representative sample for conducting a cross-sectional prevalence study .The confidence level(95%) and margin of error (5%) are also implicitly considered in the formula to ensure the reliability of the study results. Interviews and Discussions: Using purposive sampling, approximately 70 in-depth interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) will be conducted with various stakeholders, including healthcare professionals such as medical officers, health workers, and disaster control officials, as well as community representatives from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. These discussions aim to elicit both community needs and service provider perspectives, ensuring inclusivity and a comprehensive understanding of the research focus. The subsequent recruitment of participants for the qualitative questionnaire, employing a concept saturation-driven methodology to ensure comprehensive exploration of the research focus RISK, BENEFITS, CONFIDENTIALITY AND CONSENT DISSEMINATION 7.1 How will the results be disseminated? What information will be fed back to the subjects and/or participating organization? The study findings will be disseminated through various channels to ensure widespread awareness and engagement among key stakeholders. The primary modes of dissemination include: Publication in Peer-Reviewed Journals: The learnings derived from the study will be shared with the academic community and fellow researchers through publications in reputable peer-reviewed journals. This ensures the findings undergo rigorous evaluation and contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the respective field. Stakeholder Report: A comprehensive report summarizing the key findings will be crafted for distribution among all relevant stakeholders. This report will be tailored to cater to a wider audience, offering insights into the study&amp;#x27;s outcomes, implications, and potential applications. The aim is to provide accessible information that can be easily comprehended by individuals with varying levels of expertise.

The methodology, including reconnaissance visits and mixed-method approaches, reﬂects a rigorous evaluation process, resulting in tangible beneﬁts such as economic growth, social cohesion, improved quality of life, and enhanced community health and well-being. --- Page 8 --- 1. Introduction JK Cement&amp;#x27;s CSR initiatives in Nimbahera district, Rajasthan, were strategically implemented across 28 villages situated in proximity to Nimbahera City and its Sub-Division, with a focus on addressing critical areas such as health, education, environment, livelihood, rural transformation, and disaster relief. These initiatives extended their reach to encompass Chittorgarh District, particularly in Nimbahera Block, Mangrol GP, and Neemuch (Chainpura and Bawanwadi), effectively covering regions surrounding JK Cement&amp;#x27;s operational areas. Over a span of three years, the projects aimed to positively inﬂuence the socio-economic landscape of the communities they served. The primary objective of the conducted impact assessment was to evaluate the effectiveness of JK Cement&amp;#x27;s CSR interventions in Mangalore and Nimbahera. Throughout the assessment process, a suitable evaluation framework was meticulously designed to measure the impact on key focus areas, including health, education, environment, livelihood, and rural infrastructure development. Field visits were conducted to interact with beneﬁciaries and stakeholders, enabling the collection of primary data through surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions. The data collected was analysed to evaluate the outcomes and impact of CSR interventions on both the targeted beneﬁciaries and the wider community. Additionally, the assessment sought to identify success stories, best practices, and areas for improvement within the CSR initiatives. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of the existing monitoring and evaluation framework employed by JK Cement, providing recommendations for a more comprehensive and inclusive framework that encompasses all domains. --- Page 9 --- 2. Secondary Literature 2.1 Objectives of Secondary Literature The objective of this literature review is to highlight the importance of Integrated community development frameworks and how companies tend to beneﬁt from investing in CSR activities provided they follow appropriate monitoring and evaluation techniques. Further, there is an emphasis on employing a mixed-method approach to assess the outcomes of ICD programs. This forms the basis for implementing the approach in the present study, which aims to evaluate the sentiments and impact of JK Cement&amp;#x27;s CSR initiatives. 2.2 Holistic and Comprehensive Development Model The Integrated Community Development (ICD) approach highlights its effectiveness in dealing with multifaceted aspects of rural development, positioning it as a leading strategy in the ﬁeld -Arikawei (2015) . According to the International Council for Adult Education (ICAE, 2006), the essence of ICD is to achieve development that fosters social, economic, and political justice, leading to effectively addressing the complex nexus among poverty, disease, and illiteracy. 2.3 Reference Points for development model-PMAGY The integrated community development concept is integral to the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY). Within this framework, the idea of a model village is emphasised for holistic community development. A model village, as per PMAGY, possesses sufﬁcient physical and institutional infrastructure, meets the minimum needs of all sections of society, fosters harmony among residents and with the environment, and is characterised by progress and dynamism. Those villages should offer all necessary facilities for digniﬁed living, enabling residents to maximise their potential. PMAGY recommends the private corporate sector in aligning its initiatives with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (PMAGY, 2015). JK Cement will contribute to the realisation of an Integrated Community Development model, helping villages meet the criteria of an Adarsh Gram. --- Page 10 --- 2.4 Participatory and collaborative approach Community development is perceived as a purposeful endeavor aimed at fortifying the cohesion of a &amp;quot;community ﬁeld.&amp;quot; Summers (1986) emphasizes that it involves deliberate actions to initiate and sustain channels of communication and cooperation among various local groups. The essence of community development lies in building connections and collaboration, enabling collective efforts among community members. This collaborative approach is crucial for contributing to the overall well-being of the community. 2.5 Strategic alignment and development roadmap Rural community development, crucial for social change, is effectively driven by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Prioritizing collaboration with local communities and organizations maximizes beneﬁts, as per Kaushal (2019). Aligning initiatives with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) not only contributes to global sustainability but also addresses local priorities, building collaborative relationships. This strategic alignment is not only a societal responsibility but also enhances long-term viability and stakeholder trust. Integrated Community Development emerges as a holistic assessment approach, aligning outcomes with SDGs and corporate imperatives, capturing local needs effectively. --- Page 11 --- 3. Methodology The reconnaissance visit was conducted by Team CMS with the objective of gaining insights into the geography, demography, and implementation status of various interventions across different domains in the region. During the visit, all interventions were examined, and interactions were held with stakeholders and beneﬁciaries from different domain areas. The insights gathered from the reconnaissance visit were instrumental in developing tools to capture the impact of the interventions on the community. Additionally, the visit aimed to understand the community&amp;#x27;s sentiment towards the work undertaken by JK Cement and their overall perception of the organisation. After comprehensively understanding the model of interventions and the framework of the CSR initiatives, the team conducted a detailed secondary literature review on various aspects constituting the approach of Integrated Community Development and others. This literature review provided valuable insights into the existing work in the region, offering a broader perspective on the context and previous efforts undertaken in similar domains. This study employs a mixed-method approach , utilizing a non-experimental design for the impact assessment. 3.1 Quantitative methods This method was applied to capture the program&amp;#x27;s status, with a speciﬁc focus on the proximate areas where the JK Cement Plants are located: the Nimbahera block, Mangrol gram panchayat and Neemuch in the Chittorgarh District of Rajasthan State. Fig 1: Research Methodology 3.2 Qualitative methods This method helped to elaborate, connect, enhance, illustrate, and clarify the ﬁndings from the quantitative analysis. This sequential approach facilitates a more comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the ﬁndings, providing a nuanced understanding of the association between program output and outcomes. --- Page 12 --- 3.3 Selection criteria Overview of Sampling: Villages House Holds Data Collected Group Interviews RT Health Livelihood Disaster Relief Environment Education Mangrol 714 40 20 1 1 1 1 1 1 Malia kheda 583 43 28 1 1 1 1 1 1 Arniya Joshi 332 15 15 1 1 1 1 1 1 Phachar 110 36 29 1 1 1 1 1 1 Dhanora 28 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 Karunda 93 43 28 1 1 1 1 1 1 Murliya 40 20 1 1 1 1 1 1 Falwa 28 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 Total Sample 273 160 Table 1: Sample Distribution --- Page 13 --- Field planning included the implementation of mitigation measures to address potential challenges during data collection.

This theory underscores JK Cement&amp;#x27;s commitment to catalysing holistic community development and building positive, lasting impacts across various thematic areas Note: The ToC table above provides a broad overview of the CSR interventions, with a more in-depth analysis available later in the document. 3.5 Analytical framework The analysis will be conducted individually for each of the six domains, examining the current situation within each domain to identify key issues and their root causes. Subsequently, we will formulate problem statements based on these ﬁndings, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Table 3: Analytical Framework Quantitative analysis will focus on individual responses and their associated issues, while qualitative methods will attribute perspectives from other stakeholders, allowing for triangulation. Following this process across all six domains, we will integrate the results to provide a comprehensive understanding of rural development. --- Page 18 --- 3.6 Research limitations The absence of a systematic approach to identifying community needs, along with a lack of bottom-up targeted solutions and a comprehensive development roadmap, combined with a decentralized structure and prioritized interventions, may diminish the impact, scale, and sustainability of initiatives. Furthermore, limitations in the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) system, including insufﬁcient documentation, absence of targets, results framework, and Theory of Change (ToC), pose challenges in assessing expected outputs against organizational inputs and activities. Additionally, the uneven distribution of interventions across villages presented challenges in identifying beneﬁciaries for data collection. Moreover, confusion regarding the services provided by JK due to the presence of CSR initiatives from other companies in the region further complicated differentiation efforts. Conclusion: The methodology, reconnaissance visit ﬁndings, and inputs from the CSR team were incorporated into the design of the tools. Subsequently, the data collected was analyzed according to the agreed-upon methodology. --- Page 19 --- 4. Results and Findings The ﬁndings of the impact assessment comprise a combination of quantitative and qualitative data collected. The data was analysed domain-wise to provide a structured perspective on the ﬁndings within each domain. These ﬁndings not only highlight the gaps in the domain areas but also serve as the basis for formulating recommendations. 4.1 Demographic Proﬁle From the responses gathered, it is evident that the largest group beneﬁting from JK CSR Interventions belongs to the Other Backward Classes (OBC), followed by the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. As per Census 2011 data, the SC/ST population comprises 25.6% of the total population of 1,544,000 in Chittorgarh district. Therefore, this validates the lesser number of beneﬁciaries in the SC/ST category. Fig 2: Social Category Income of Beneﬁciaries The majority of beneﬁciaries were found to be engaged in farming and cattle-rearing activities. Our reconnaissance visit revealed that a signiﬁcant portion of the community was involved in agricultural and related endeavours. Additionally, a considerable number of beneﬁciaries held employment in various cement corporations across the region. Additionally, out of the 273 responses received, a larger proportion of beneﬁciaries, speciﬁcally 178 individuals, were classiﬁed as above the poverty line compared to 154 individuals classiﬁed as below the poverty line. Fig 3: Family’s Main Occupation However, it is notable that the reported monthly income of these beneﬁciaries amounted to INR 15,000. --- Page 20 --- 4.2 Rural Transformation JK Cement&amp;#x27;s rural transformation initiatives focus on enhancing rural infrastructure, such as roads and community buildings, which yield signiﬁcant beneﬁts. The implementation of concrete roads facilitates transportation, reducing costs for farmers and broadening market access, thereby boosting agricultural income. Additionally, the establishment of community buildings promotes social cohesion by offering spaces for gatherings, meetings, and events, thereby strengthening unity among residents. Fig 4: Activities implemented under Rural Transformation OUTCOMES Short-Term/Medium Term (0-4 years) Long Term Potential (5-7 years) Boost rural mobility and service access Economic growth of households Boosting farmers&amp;#x27; income by improving market access for produce. Bullwhip effect -Emergence of small businesses Enhancing community spirit with gatherings. Increased enrolment in higher education Improvement in hygiene &amp;amp; potential improvement in environmental aspects --- Page 21 --- 4.2.1 Improving efﬁciency, effectiveness and accessibility: CC Roads The community has reported a positive experience regarding the construction of CC roads in their village, with the majority of respondents grading the state connectivity of the roads as good to excellent. The construction of CC roads has signiﬁcantly enhanced the travel experience for community members, reducing their travel time. Previously, uneven roads and numerous potholes caused water accumulation, which facilitated mosquito breeding grounds and contributed to a decrease in waterborne diseases within the society. Fig 5: Current state of roads Fig 6: Applications of CC Roads Moreover, businesses faced challenges in transporting goods due to road conditions, but with the introduction of CC roads, this has become much smoother, preventing damage to goods during transportation. 4.2.2 Application of Roads The construction of CC roads has yielded a signiﬁcant outcome by connecting prime locations, thereby simplifying commuting for community members. These roads have facilitated greater connectivity with the main road, expanding access to markets, block hospitals, and schools. Given that the main road leads to the market area and links villages to Nimbahera, where better services are available in terms of markets, healthcare, and other essential amenities, the impact of improved connectivity on overall accessibility and quality of life for residents is noteworthy. Img Desc: Board displaying CC Road Construction by JK Cement --- Page 22 --- 4.2.3 Community halls &amp;amp; Cremation grounds: Enhancing Community Spirit and Cost Efﬁciency Fig 7: Community Hall’s Impact on Village Life The majority of community members view the community halls positively, although 11% express neutrality or dissatisfaction, mainly among families who have used the hall for the past 3 years. However, a few from Dhanora village advocate for a separate hall to meet their community&amp;#x27;s needs. Community halls serve as versatile venues for various events, including weddings, engagements, religious functions, and cultural events, catering to all social categories. Their cost-effectiveness is evident compared to private banquet halls, with hosting an event costing only INR 2100, overseen by a community-led committee. With the development of community halls in the villages, it has strongly instilled a sense of unity in the community. Fig 8: Sense of Unity Fig 9: Cost Comparison: Private halls VS Community Halls --- Page 23 --- The majority of community members view the community halls positively, although 11% express neutrality or dissatisfaction, mainly among families who have used the hall for the past 3 years. However, a few from Dhanora village advocate for a separate hall to meet their community&amp;#x27;s needs. Community halls serve as versatile venues for various events, including weddings, engagements, religious functions, and cultural events, catering to all social categories. Their cost-effectiveness is evident compared to private banquet halls, with hosting an event costing only INR 2100, overseen by a community-led committee. While most responses indicate moderate cleanliness ratings for the crematorium, residents from villages such as Phachar Ahiran have highlighted issues stemming from the lack of water facilities in the vicinity. Fig 10: Crematorium Cleanliness Fig 11: Facilities at Crematorium Additionally, the absence of waste disposal infrastructure poses a challenge. Despite these concerns, the crematorium is adequately equipped with essential facilities to accommodate mourners. However, adhering to Hindu customs, mourners are required to bathe after cremation before returning home. Consequently, there is a community-voiced need for bathing facilities to be added at the crematorium as an additional amenity. Case Study: The Role of Community Halls --- Page 24 --- 4.3 Livelihood JK Cement&amp;#x27;s community interventions address accessibility challenges in ﬁnance, markets, and livelihoods. Efforts such as skill development classes and artiﬁcial insemination of cows have increased milk production and income. Value-addition services further enhance earnings. These efforts have resulted in established testing equipment and quality assurance systems to ensure stable milk production income, accompanied by measures to safeguard the health and productivity of cows. Fig 12: Activities implemented under Livelihood OUTCOMES Short-Term/Medium Term(0-4 years) Long Term Potential (5-7 years) Increased milk production Ensuring cow health and productivity, Income change Empowering women: Self-owned ventures Value addition services --- Page 25 --- Our survey ﬁndings revealed that the AI of cows&amp;#x27; livelihood intervention had the highest participation rate among community members, followed by the Skill Development classes for women. Upon interacting with beneﬁciaries, we discovered that compared to other livelihood interventions in the region, most residents were well aware of these two interventions. Fig 13: Participation Levels 4.3.1 Livelihood Outcomes Skill Development Tailoring and beautician classes attended by women have signiﬁcantly boosted their economic status. Many now utilize their skills to stitch clothes at home, earning extra income. Some have even opened their own beauty parlours and stitching shops, promoting ﬁnancial independence and conﬁdence. Previously limited to household tasks, women now turn hobbies into proﬁtable ventures. Respondents eagerly embrace these classes, using their time productively beyond household duties. This newfound conﬁdence empowers women to actively engage in household decision-making. Img Desc: Women packaging Sparsh Sanitary Napkins Img Desc: AI Cows in a Dairy Farm Increased Milk Production: Artiﬁcial insemination In the region, the introduction of artiﬁcial insemination has led farmers to transition from the &amp;#x27;Desi&amp;#x27; breed to improved cow breeds, increasing milk production from 3-4 to 9-10 litres per day. This shift has prompted many farmers to upgrade to higher-quality cattle, expanding their livestock from 2-3 cows to 7-10 cows and buffaloes. As a result, farmers now supply milk to the Saras Milk Cooperative and offer door-to-door delivery services, priced at INR 35 per litre for cow milk and INR 50 per litre for buffalo milk. Some --- Page 26 --- farmers have also diversiﬁed into value-added products like ghee and cottage cheese, signiﬁcantly improving their economic status and household income. Income change After acquiring the necessary skills and resources, individuals have transformed these assets into income-generating activities, thereby improving their economic standing. Previously limited to meeting family needs, farmers have expanded their milk production into viable businesses. Similarly, women skilled in tailoring and beautician services have turned their hobbies into sources of income. 4.3.2 Estimating Revenue of Livelihood Initiatives - AI and Skill Development The calculation outlines the anticipated milk production from cows that have undergone Artiﬁcial Insemination (AI) and the subsequent offspring. With an assumed daily production of 7 litres per cow over a span of 200 days, the gross income from milk sales is estimated at INR 2,94,000. After factoring in approximate livestock care expenses of INR 80,000, the projected net income stands at approximately INR 2,00000 per family in a year. The skill development in tailoring among women has created opportunities for home-based earning. While initial investment in sewing machines varies, income from stitching garments, especially during festivals, amounts to approximately INR 5000 per month. After deducting expenses for thread, machine oil, and other materials, the net monthly income averages around INR 4800. Moreover, with the guidance of cattle experts and access to cattle medicines provided through health camps, JK farmers have witnessed signiﬁcant improvements in the quality --- Page 27 --- of their cattle. This support has not only led to increased income levels for many farmers but has also enhanced their entrepreneurial ventures. Fig 14: Impact of Sanitary Products Sanitary Napkin Production: Menstrual Health Hygiene The intervention has led to improved hygiene practices among women, reducing infections and increasing comfort and participation in activities. However, the stigma surrounding menstruation persists, hindering open discussion. Short-term outcomes include improved hygiene practices, while long-term beneﬁts may include better waste management, reduced stigma, and lowered health risks. Additionally, the intervention has created livelihood opportunities for women in sanitary napkin production, offering ﬁnancial independence and conﬁdence, especially for those from disadvantaged backgrounds who have experienced domestic abuse. They also play a vital role in spreading menstrual health awareness within the community. Case Study: Use of AI in Milk Production --- Page 28 --- 4.4 Healthcare JK Cement&amp;#x27;s healthcare interventions are aimed at addressing immediate needs within the community&amp;#x27;s healthcare landscape. Through the establishment of hospital infrastructure, including the construction of medical facilities and the deployment of mobile health units, the company achieved positive short-term outcomes. These initiatives enhanced healthcare accessibility, guaranteeing prompt medical attention for community members. Fig 15: Activities implemented under the Healthcare Domain OUTCOMES Short-Term/Medium Term (0-4 years) Long Term Potential (5-7 years) Health Behaviour Changes Eliminations /Remission/mitigation of health conditions Better health-related consultation and advice enable the community to take preventive diagnostic Established holistic healthcare support for identiﬁed health conditions - Prenatal to Postnatal improving MMR/IMR --- Page 29 --- The short-term outcomes of JK Cement&amp;#x27;s healthcare interventions were focused on the healthcare landscape within the community. The establishment of hospital infrastructure, including the construction of medical facilities and deployment of mobile health units, has immediate positive effects. These initiatives improve healthcare accessibility, ensuring that community members can receive prompt medical attention. Regular health check-ups conducted through mobile units facilitate early detection of health issues, contributing to preventive healthcare measures. The provision of necessary medicines during these check-ups addresses immediate health concerns, promoting the well-being of individuals. In the short term, these interventions collectively enhance the community&amp;#x27;s health awareness and immediate healthcare needs, laying the groundwork for sustained health improvement. 4.4.1 Health Outcomes: The Community Perspective The improvement in community health, as indicated by the responses, unveils a shift within the community. JK Cement&amp;#x27;s interventions have played a role in building this positive change. About 51% of respondents feel there has been a community health improvement because of Jk’s health initiatives. About 39% also responded that they have better access to medical care. By implementing interventions such as health camps, medical equipment provision, and infrastructure development in hospitals, JK Cement has enhanced the availability of healthcare services.

Case Study: Journey of Women Towards Health Empowerment in Phachar --- Page 31 --- 4.5 Environment --- Page 32 --- JK Cement&amp;#x27;s Environmental Initiative primarily focused on water interventions, ensuring neighbouring villages had access to clean water. Additionally, they planted trees around schools and roads, contributing to sustainable development goals related to clean water and sanitation, as well as climate action. OUTCOMES Short-Term/Medium Term (0-4 years) Long Term Potential (5-7 years) Access to clean water for local communities Sustainable water supply during droughts or water scarcity Better control and distribution of water resources Increase in groundwater availability/increase in water quality Fig 19: Activities implemented under Environment Fig 20: Water Access Impact --- Page 33 --- During mining operations in the cement industry, water emerges from the top of water tables and is transported to nearby villages. While some villages near the mines directly receive water, others rely on private tankers and government borewells. JK Cement&amp;#x27;s environmental initiative has improved water access, with 72% of respondents expressing satisfaction with pipeline water quality. However, concerns remain, including water pressure issues and dissatisfaction with installation fees. Despite efforts, water scarcity persists in some areas, such as Karunda, where water quality concerns lead to limited usage, and reliance on tankers persists in villages like Saand and Payri. Mining operations acquiring wells further exacerbate water scarcity in Karunda. 4.5.1 Construction of CC Road: Mitigation of Dust Given the current situation of smog and pollution in metropolitan cities in India, daily life and activities have become increasingly challenging, with adverse effects on health.

Based on ﬁndings from the community, 86% of respondents believe the disaster relief activities by JK Cement have been very effective. Preventing Infection: The Lumpy Story In August 2022, Rajasthan witnessed a signiﬁcant outbreak of lumpy skin disease, affecting nearly 94,000 cattle. JK Cement responded swiftly by organizing large-scale vaccination drives, reaching approximately 86% of beneﬁciaries. Focus Group Discussions highlighted the effectiveness of early vaccination in containing the disease. Beyond immediate control, JK Cement&amp;#x27;s intervention aimed at long-term livestock health improvement, resulting in a reduction in lumpy disease cases over time. The community positively responded to JK Cement&amp;#x27;s active involvement, contrasting it with the perceived inactivity of other corporations. This reﬂects JK Cement&amp;#x27;s commitment to corporate social responsibility and its proactive approach to supporting communities during crises. Fig 23: Type of Disaster Relief Interventions Implemented 4.6.1 Navigating Challenges: JK Cement&amp;#x27;s Impactful COVID-19 Relief Measures JK Cement&amp;#x27;s relief efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly through mask and PPE kit distribution, were crucial for community safety, as noted by 69% of beneﬁciaries. However, 19% of households remained unaware of these initiatives, suggesting a communication gap that needs addressing to ensure equitable access to relief measures. --- Page 36 --- In addition to pandemic-related relief, JK Cement&amp;#x27;s sanitation initiatives garnered positive feedback, especially the multiple rounds of sanitation spraying in areas like Phachar and Murliya. This proactive approach not only aligns with global health guidelines but also directly addresses the expressed needs of the community. It underscores JK Cement&amp;#x27;s commitment to providing timely and impactful support during times of crisis. 4.7 Education JK Cement has been actively involved in education interventions, striving to enhance the learning environment, improve infrastructure, and contribute to the holistic development of students. Their key interventions include school infrastructure development. This includes the building of classrooms and a library, water supply in the school, distribution of educational resources (uniforms, bags, etc), the building of a sports stadium for football, organising sports tournaments and conducting coaching classes for students. --- Page 37 --- Fig 24: Activities implemented under Education Fig 25: Quality of School Infra. Based on the interaction with the community, the overall response shows that 73% per cent of the community thinks that the quality of school infrastructure made by JK Cement is of good quality. Findings from the qualitative side also reveal how the community reported how these school OUTCOMES Short-Term/Medium Term (0-4 years) Long Term Potential (5-7 years) Increase in positive perceptions about the school environment Reduction in dropout rates. Active participation of students in sports, Increased participation in sports, particularly among female students. Conducive learning environment, boosting students&amp;#x27; morale Assuring holistic development of students --- Page 38 --- infrastructure changes reﬂect positive perceptions of education within the community. A limitation of the study we have conducted shows that outcomes such as enrollment and attendance cannot be ascertained and correlated with educational infrastructure interventions. This can be explored with a longitudinal research study. 4.7.1 Education Accessibility Fig: 26: Accessibility of Educational Resources The educational resources provided by JK Cement are easily accessible for about 52% of respondents followed by 44% of respondents highlighting limited access. This can be attributed to the uneven distribution of educational resources. Despite the company&amp;#x27;s focus on infrastructure development, the distribution of essential resources such as books, water, and uniforms across villages has been uneven. This disparity has led to limited access for many beneﬁciaries. This ﬁnding is also supported by qualitative interviews in which beneﬁciaries responded that the sports stadium is in Mangrol and the lack of geographical proximity serves as a barrier to accessibility. 4.7.2 Spearheading Sports: The Impact on Sports Participation Survey ﬁndings reveal that 80% of respondents acknowledge the high quality of sports equipment provided by JK Cement, showcasing its positive impact on students&amp;#x27; physical well-being, teamwork, and discipline. This initiative promotes inclusivity in education, enhancing academic performance and building a positive school culture. Beyond individual beneﬁts, engaged students positively inﬂuence the community, promoting unity and vitality. JK Cement&amp;#x27;s efforts have led to a 17% increase in sports participation and a further 16% indicating moderate engagement, indicating a signiﬁcant impact on community sports involvement. This surge in participation, attributed to the provision of sports kits and a supportive environment, reﬂects a changing community attitude towards sports, encouraging a more active lifestyle --- Page 39 --- 5. Conclusion JK Cement&amp;#x27;s CSR initiatives in Nimbahera district, Rajasthan, demonstrate a holistic approach to rural community development, addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges. Through participatory decision-making and resource mobilization, they&amp;#x27;ve facilitated development across 28 villages near Nimbahera City over three years. The literature review emphasizes the importance of Integrated Community Development (ICD) and participatory approaches, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Their methodology, including reconnaissance visits and thorough community engagement, ensures rigorous evaluation. Findings indicate tangible beneﬁts like economic growth, social cohesion, improved quality of life, and enhanced community health. Notable improvements include rural infrastructure, livelihood opportunities, healthcare access, water supply, disaster resilience, and education. --- Page 40 --- To sustain positive outcomes and address ongoing challenges, such as resource distribution and water shortages, continued commitment and collaboration with stakeholders are essential. JK Cement&amp;#x27;s dedication to rural development can foster resilient and empowered communities in the long term. 6. Recommendations 6.1 Strategic Recommendations JK Cement&amp;#x27;s CSR interventions need to focus more on the supply side, particularly in catalysing conversion efforts related to ﬁnance, markets, advocacy, and governance. This entails identifying and engaging with key stakeholders to establish a governance mechanism that can effectively capture community needs and demands. By actively involving stakeholders in activity planning, budget allocation, and resource management, JK Cement can ensure that its initiatives align with both grassroots and political interests. To facilitate holistic community development, it&amp;#x27;s imperative to develop an Integrated Community Development Index, inspired by the Adarsh Gram Panchayat Development Model and GPDP. This index will serve as a comprehensive framework for assessing progress across various domains, guiding the allocation of resources, and evaluating the impact of interventions. A strategic approach involves initiating a pilot program and crafting a detailed Action Plan spanning 3 to 5 years. This plan should outline clear priorities, set achievable targets, and establish thematic areas of focus. By adopting this structured approach, JK Cement can enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of its CSR initiatives while promoting meaningful socio-economic development in the communities it serves. There is a need to strengthen the focus on a catalytic and collaborative model-orchestrate, inﬂuence and solve( https://communityactioncollab.org/action ) rather than a delivering and implementation model. JK&amp;#x27;s CSR interventions currently lack structured planning and stakeholder engagement. It&amp;#x27;s crucial to involve key stakeholders, identify vulnerable communities, and prioritise thematic areas for intervention. Collaboration with Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and other market players is essential for holistic development initiatives. For instance, partnering with organisations like Godrej to facilitate women&amp;#x27;s skill development aligned with market demands and Vrutti to enhance farm-related sectors. This approach will ensure more effective and impactful CSR initiatives. --- Page 41 --- The stakeholder engagement currently follows a top-down and ad hoc approach, resulting in a weaker governance mechanism that impacts budgeting, priority setting, timelines, and resource allocation. It&amp;#x27;s vital to transition towards a more structured and inclusive approach, with regular and agenda-speciﬁc engagement mechanisms involving key ofﬁcials, community members, and stakeholders. This shift will foster structured planning and stakeholder engagement, enabling the identiﬁcation of vulnerable communities and prioritisation of intervention areas. Reliance Foundation&amp;#x27;s approach to catalysing community leadership through Rural Institutions serves as a valuable reference in this regard: ( https://reliancefoundation.org/rural-transformation#:~:text=Reliance%20Foundation%20contri butes%20towards%20the,made%20by%20Gram%20Sabha%20members ) 6.2 Monitoring and Evaluation Recommendations JK Cement should establish a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) framework to gauge the effectiveness of its CSR initiatives. This framework, incorporating clear targets, a results framework, and a Theory of Change (ToC) for each project, enables outcome measurement and adaptive management. Integrating stakeholder feedback mechanisms and participatory evaluation approaches enhances accountability and community engagement. Aligning program indicators with global and national measurement standards, utilizing frameworks like the Rainbow Framework and SMART indicators, ensures data comparability and usability. Updating terminologies to industry standards fosters clarity and transparency, while regular dissemination of M&amp;amp;E ﬁndings promotes a culture of learning. Embracing data science and technology through concurrent monitoring systems and GIS mapping enhances efﬁciency and provides valuable insights for proactive decision-making. 6.3 Programmatic Recommendations 6.3.1 Rural Transformation In the realm of rural transformation, JK Cement can collaborate with Gram Panchayats to establish parks and public spaces as part of the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) or the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana (PMGAY). Additionally, prioritising repairs, renovations, and maintenance of key infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and community facilities is essential. Implementing a comprehensive construction management framework will streamline execution, ensuring cost-effectiveness and maintaining high-quality standards. This approach will not only enhance the physical infrastructure but also contribute to the overall socio-economic --- Page 42 --- development of rural areas. Please review the model of AKRSP and Dhan Foundation in catalysing the power of Rural Governance: as a reference: https://www.akrspindia.org.in/web/whatwedo/ruralgovernance https://dhan.org/themes/panchayat.php 6.3.2 Health To enhance its impact on community health, JK Cement should employ a comprehensive approach. This involves implementing healthcare interventions covering preventive, curative, and diagnostic measures for prevalent diseases. Collaborating closely with the public healthcare system and village healthcare workers like ASHAs, ANMs, and Anganwadi workers will expand outreach and engagement, leveraging existing community connections. By adopting a holistic health perspective addressing nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene, JK Cement can contribute to sustainable improvements in community well-being. Furthermore, integrating healthcare initiatives with infrastructure projects, such as hospital construction or medical camps, ensures efﬁcient resource utilisation and long-term beneﬁts for community health. Additionally, strengthening community systems and integrating initiatives like POSHAN, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), and the National Programme for Healthcare of the Elderly (NPHCE) will further enhance the effectiveness of JK Cement&amp;#x27;s healthcare interventions. Please review the model of Swasti in promoting Community Systems and integrating Govt initiatives. https://swasti.org/our_work/Community-Systems-Strengthening 6.3.3 Education To maximise the impact of its sports initiatives, JK Cement should strategically expand collaborations with local sports associations and schools, integrating structured sports programs to increase awareness and participation among beneﬁciaries while aligning with community interests. Prioritising infrastructure enhancement by providing necessary amenities for all genders during tournaments will create a more inclusive environment. Clear communication and branding efforts are crucial to ensure beneﬁciaries understand JK Cement&amp;#x27;s contributions to community development, enhancing transparency. To further engage students and promote their interest in education, JK Cement should organise additional activities like essay writing, and cultural, and sports competitions at the district/block level. These initiatives will encourage student participation and foster camaraderie and healthy competition. Complementing school infrastructure construction with these events can create a holistic educational environment that nurtures both academic and non-academic talents. It&amp;#x27;s recommended to provide solutions for children from government schools and low-income --- Page 43 --- communities, ensuring quality school education for all children while focusing on improving learning outcomes, FLN (Foundational Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy), ECE (Early Childhood Education), effective adoption of EdTech and strengthening School Governance and strengthening school governance. Lifeskills: This approach is focused on breaking the cycle of poverty by empowering at-risk children with the resources to complete secondary education and gain skills to become employable upon graduation. The program provides positive reinforcement of life skills, especially for girls. Educating girls serves to have them continue to college, marry much later, have fewer children and most importantly educate their own children. https://magicbususa.org/childhood-to-livelihood/ Sports: Enabling Leadership program works in schools to help children garner multiple beneﬁts of leadership development using football as a medium. Through a ﬂagship curriculum that combines life skills with football drills, students engage in year-round rigorous training, participate in national leagues and get scouted at games, gaining exposure to sport and competition simultaneously . https://enablingleadership.org/play/ 6.3.4 Livelihood In the domain of livelihood enhancement, JK Cement&amp;#x27;s CSR initiatives can focus on several key areas to uplift the community. Investing in capacity building for Milk Cooperative Societies can empower farmers with the knowledge and skills for value addition services such as Paneer, Butter, and Ghee production, thereby increasing their income opportunities. Additionally, establishing partnerships with farmers through Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can facilitate access to subsidies for seeds, distribution of supplements, and procurement support, promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Moreover, providing feedstock for industries, such as Hay and Stubble, can create additional revenue streams for farmers while promoting environmental sustainability. Lastly, offering skill development programs tailored to household-centric income generation activities, particularly in ﬁelds like tailoring, can empower women economically. Ensuring the accessibility of these skill development initiatives to all women in the community will promote inclusivity and facilitate economic empowerment at the grassroots level. Market Linkage : PRADHAN&amp;#x27;s PROWFIT and LEAP initiatives target smallholder farmers in India&amp;#x27;s eastern regions. LEAP, supported by the Walmart Foundation, empowers women farmers by providing market access, while PROWFIT, a collaboration between PRADAN and the Walmart --- Page 44 --- Foundation, focuses on transforming Farmer Producer Organizations led by women. Both initiatives aim to empower women economically, socially, and politically, enhancing farm incomes and promoting sustainable agriculture. By building capacity and creating market linkages, they contribute to inclusive rural development, highlighting the agency of marginalised communities in shaping their futures. More information about PROWFIT can be found at: https://www.pradan.net/about-prowﬁt/ 3 Fold Model for Farmers: The program focuses on building wealthy, resilient, and responsible farmers through Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and Value Addition Services, aiming to make them successful entrepreneurs and sustained job creators, with their income increased by three times. It emphasises the empowerment of farmers and their entrepreneurship potential, nudging them towards achieving impactful outcomes. More information about the 3 Fold Model can be found at: https://vruttiimpactcatalysts.org/our-core-impact-model/ 6.3.5 Environment JK Cement&amp;#x27;s future CSR initiatives in environmental conservation and water resource management can aim to address the challenges associated with insufﬁcient access to water resources. These efforts can focus on provisioning water to tanks and pipelines to improve local communities access to clean water and ensure better control and distribution of water resources. Sustainable water supply measures can be implemented to enhance resilience during droughts or water scarcity periods. Additionally, initiatives can target increasing groundwater availability and improving its quality, with expected increases in groundwater levels and enhancement in water quality parameters such as pH and COD/BOD levels. To further enhance the effectiveness of these initiatives, JK Cement can consider establishing a water testing facility or collaborating with organisations specialising in water quality assessment to ensure the provision of safe and high-quality drinking water. Soil testing can also be prioritised to support agricultural sustainability and crop productivity. Furthermore, there is a need for a sustainable model of engagement with the community to aspire, and acquire the capacity and knowledge to run the program. The environmental initiatives need to motivate the community to come together as one unit, a task in which JK Cement has the inﬂuence to mobilise and facilitate through existing government initiatives and formal systems such as Gram Panchayats or Village Development Committees. This comprehensive approach should encompass climate resilience, soil conservation, the promotion of solar energy, and water conservation agricultural practices. Please ﬁnd the reference for incentivising and building community-led environmental initiatives https://www.paanifoundation.in/our-work/ --- Page 45 --- 6.3.6 Disaster Relief To enhance JK Cement&amp;#x27;s disaster relief measures, it&amp;#x27;s imperative to develop a comprehensive drought mitigation plan tailored to the region&amp;#x27;s speciﬁc hazards. This plan should encompass strategies such as water conservation, drought-resistant agriculture, and community education on effective water management practices. Additionally, proactive measures to address other potential hazards like ﬂoods or landslides should be seamlessly integrated into the disaster preparedness framework. Clear protocols and coordination mechanisms with local authorities, emergency response teams, and community organisations must be established to ensure swift and effective responses during emergencies, thereby minimising their impact on the community and promoting resilience. Furthermore, JK Cement should pivot its CSR interventions towards income-generating initiatives to ensure sustainability and lasting impact. Many existing interventions suffer from inadequate maintenance, resulting in infrastructure deterioration over time. By establishing a community-centric maintenance team, JK Cement can effectively address this issue and uphold the longevity of its projects. This strategic shift should be underpinned by a thorough review of the community&amp;#x27;s disaster experiences, encompassing challenges such as crop failures, livestock diseases, ﬁnancial crises, and other household-level impacts. Such a holistic approach will enable JK Cement to tailor its interventions to the community&amp;#x27;s evolving needs and enhance its overall resilience to disasters. Disaster management and community resilience models have to be developed and shared with the works of Aga Khan Foundation. https://www.akrspindia.org.in/web/whatwedo/agricultureandclimateresilience Furthermore, providing ﬁnancial literacy programs for women and youth can enhance their economic empowerment. Additionally, looking at smartphone digital connectivity and offering relevant courses for youth could facilitate their skill development. 7.

The company&amp;#x27;s commitment to various facets of rural development is evident in its signiﬁcant contributions. Notably, JK Cement has prioritised the improvement of public infrastructure, focusing on essential facilities such as schools, community meeting halls, and cremation grounds. These initiatives are executed in consultation with and guidance from community leaders. Another crucial facet of JK Cement&amp;#x27;s rural development projects involves the construction of CC roads in intervention villages, thereby bolstering connectivity within these communities. Beyond these infrastructure enhancements, the company has made substantial strides in elevating the region&amp;#x27;s sports landscape. In Mangrol, JK Cement has played a pivotal role in constructing a stadium, thereby contributing to the advancement of sports in the area. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 4 --- Page 5 --- JK Cem ent Nim bahera -Im pact Assessm ent This progress has been achieved through close collaboration with the Mangrol Football Association, leading to signiﬁcant developments in the realm of sports. JK Cement&amp;#x27;s multifaceted approach underscores its commitment to comprehensive and sustainable rural development, addressing both basic infrastructure needs and the promotion of sports activities in the region. 1.2.2 Water Management/Conservancy JK Cement has undertaken signiﬁcant initiatives in the realm of water conservation, speciﬁcally addressing the water-related challenges faced by communities residing in the vicinity of the JK Cement Plant. Following the limestone mining process, the residual water that surfaces is efﬁciently channelled to a water tank in Paeri village, Nimbahera. This strategic placement of the water tank has facilitated the installation of pipelines in the adjacent households, ensuring convenient access to water resources. In a collaborative effort with the Gram Panchayat, JK Cement has actively contributed to the establishment of a pond in Nimbahera, further enhancing water management in the region. The company has implemented a systematic transportation system, utilising pipelines to convey water from the mining sites to the village on a consistent basis. This comprehensive approach not only addresses immediate water supply needs but also underscores JK Cement&amp;#x27;s commitment to sustainable water solutions for the communities it serves. 1.2.3 Healthcare JK Cement has launched a Mobile Van Healthcare Unit, a proactive initiative that systematically conducts health camps in intervention villages and schools. This unit diligently performs routine health check-ups for the community, demonstrating a commitment to the well-being of the residents. Recently, the medical professionals operating the Mobile Van Healthcare Unit have expanded their scope to include screenings for signs of anaemia, recognizing the increasing prevalence of this health condition among the local population.

Education The educational environment is pivotal in shaping the motivation of students to attend schools. Recognizing this, JK Cement has actively contributed to the development of educational infrastructure in the region. In Malya Khedi village, Nimbahera, JK Cement has played a key role in enhancing the infrastructure of the anganwadi, creating a conducive learning environment for young children. Furthermore, JK Cement has extended its commitment to educational infrastructure development to Fachar, where the Middle School infrastructure has been improved, aligning with the company&amp;#x27;s dedication to fostering educational advancement. In a bid to further support higher studies, JK Cement has facilitated the establishment of a library. This resource not only provides students in the area with access to a shared space but also serves as a valuable tool for their preparation for competitive exams. 1.2.5 Environment Environmental conservation holds paramount importance for JK Cement, reﬂecting the company&amp;#x27;s dedicated commitment to sustainable practices. In alignment with this commitment, the company has prioritised afforestation initiatives as a proactive measure. Signiﬁcant efforts have been directed towards planting trees in the vicinity of schools and common areas. To ensure the longevity and protection of these planted trees and plants, JK Cement has also implemented the installation of protective fences. Moreover, the company has rigorously addressed the imperative of water conservation, as previously detailed. 1.2.6 Livelihood In a collaborative effort with Surbhi Self-Help Group (SHG), JK Cement has taken proactive measures to empower women in the region through the implementation of livelihood ventures. These initiatives aim to provide sustainable employment opportunities for women. Engaging in diverse activities, the women contribute to the production of homemade delicacies such as pickles (aachar), papads, and other culinary items. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

This not only creates economic opportunities for the women but also addresses a crucial aspect of women&amp;#x27;s health and hygiene. Expanding their entrepreneurial endeavours, these women also produce cloth bags, supplying them to nearby departmental stores, thereby contributing to the local business landscape. 1.2.7 Livestock Development (Insemination) A distinct sector within the JK Cement umbrella, namely JK Trusts, is dedicated to enhancing milk production through the implementation of Artiﬁcial Insemination techniques for cows. This strategic initiative has resulted in a notable upswing in milk production, concurrently bolstering the ﬁnancial gains of local farmers. JK Trusts have appointed individuals from the community, referred to as &amp;#x27;Gopal,&amp;#x27; to oversee the well-being of the cows and manage the entire artiﬁcial insemination process. This comprehensive approach not only emphasises JK Trusts&amp;#x27; commitment to fostering sustainable agricultural practices and rural economic development but also highlights its dedication to the goal of upscaling the milk production in the region.

Among these, the integrated community development approach stands out as particularly noteworthy, garnering widespread acceptance for its holistic and comprehensive framework. This approach has proven effective in addressing the multifaceted aspects of rural development, marking it as a leading strategy in the ﬁeld. (Arikawei, 2015) The essence of the integrated community development (ICD) as conceived by the International Council for Adult Education (ICAE, 2006) is to achieve development to engender the social, economic and political justice that will lead to the liberation of mankind through the eradication of scourges such as mass poverty, disease and illiteracy. Community development is perceived as a deliberate and purposeful endeavour carried out by individuals to fortify the cohesion of a &amp;quot;community ﬁeld.&amp;quot; This involves engaging in actions that not only initiate but also sustain channels of communication and cooperation among various local groups. The essence of community development lies in fostering connections and collaboration, enabling the collective efforts of community members to ﬂourish and contribute to the overall well-being of the community.(Summers, 1986) Rural community development is planned intervention to stimulate social change for the explicit purpose of the &amp;quot;betterment of the people.&amp;quot; Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can serve as a highly effective strategy for fostering loyalty and trust within the customer base and local community where a business operates. Companies should prioritise CSR initiatives in collaboration with their members, local community members, and relevant organisations to maximise the beneﬁts for the target population and maintain transparency about their contributions to societal welfare and development. Recognizing the challenge of establishing direct relationships with every individual in society, many companies create dedicated divisions to manage and execute CSR activities within their operational vicinity.

Survey instrument review and ﬁnalisation Figure 3: Survey Tools 2.1 Description of Approach, Methodology and Work Plan 2.1.1 Research Methodology This study employs a mixed-method approach, utilising a non-experimental design for the impact assessment. Quantitative methods will be applied to capture the program&amp;#x27;s status, with a speciﬁc focus on the two proximate areas where the JK Cement Plants are located: the Nimbahera block and the Mangrol gram panchayat in the Chittorgarh District of Rajasthan State. Following the quantitative phase, qualitative methods come into play to elaborate, connect, enhance, illustrate, and clarify the ﬁndings from the quantitative analysis. This sequential approach facilitates a more comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the ﬁndings, providing a nuanced understanding of the association between program output and its ultimate impact.

Data Analysis Figure 6: LFA Example In our comprehensive evaluation, we will delve into the Logical Framework Analysis of JK Cements&amp;#x27; initiatives across distinct domains, such as rural development, healthcare, education, sports, and livelihood, as can be seen in Fig 6 . This analytical framework entails a meticulous examination of the outputs and outcomes in relation to the initial problems identiﬁed, the inputs allocated, and the speciﬁc activities carried out to ameliorate these issues. By adopting this methodological approach, our objective is to gain a nuanced understanding of the projects&amp;#x27; outcomes and assess the impact of the inputs invested. This process involves a detailed exploration of how the various interventions and activities undertaken in each domain contribute to addressing the identiﬁed challenges, fostering a thorough comprehension of the overall effectiveness and sustainability of JK Cements&amp;#x27; initiatives. 3.1 Quantitative analysis ● Descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode will be widely used along with frequency tables. ● Inferential statistics such as cross-tabulation (or crosstab) tables show the relationships among survey variables in a summarised matrix display. ● Trying to establish correlation between project indicators and other inﬂuencing factors.

There are two main types of inferential statistics - hypothesis testing and regression analysis-Multiple-ANOVA/Multiple Linear Regression and the applicable ones. In the Baseline, we may identify co-relations and establish causal relationships are almost impossible. Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics will initially be done with frequency tables and cross-tabulations. Further heterogeneity analysis will be conducted to further unpack the impacts at various sub-group levels. Heterogeneity Analysis Role of externalities: CMS does not have a directional hypothesis about how the programme will differentially affect individuals and who support interventions and those who are not. It is possible that program participants might beneﬁt more from the programme as they already have access to credit and other institutional beneﬁts. The quantitative household assessment will be facilitated with qualiﬁed enumerators through a CAPI administered tool. The qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations will help to understand enabling pathways and barriers that can improve the implementation model and generate best practice and systemic process documents that can be taken as evidence for scaling up. These qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. Vulnerability Analysis The study intends to document a few cases from the personal interviews along with the grading assessment that would represent “higher impact beneﬁciaries” and “lower impact beneﬁciaries needing further augmentation”, to understand the contextual and operational constraints or opportunities that can explain their speciﬁc trajectories. 3.2 Qualitative Evaluation This would attempt to capture the perspectives of key stakeholders upon the Life Skills Education program. The underlying reasons, motivations, collective opinions, and key narratives would be captured. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Focus Group Discussion: In the proposal stage, identify a set of key stakeholders who have individual perspectives and roles which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. For example, parents would share the credibility and recognition of Life Skills Education interventions considering their socio-economic challenges. In-Depth interviews/Key Informant Interviews: In the proposal stage, identiﬁed a set of key stakeholders who have collective opinions which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. For example, teachers and Education department ofﬁcials’ individual perspectives and attitudes determine the support and effectiveness of the interventions. Systems and documentation review: The role of ﬁdelity and process adherence would be reviewed against set SoPs, documents, reported and unreported information. They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative data analysis the Theory of Change envisioned in the program will be reviewed through the exercise of Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. A critical review of the Theory of Change will allow us to identify the Causal Assumptions and Implementation assumptions . To understand the implementation assumptions, it is necessary to empathise with the student’s journey from primary to successful completion in Life skill development. This will be critical to capture key aspects that would challenge the program’s success and failure. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Quality assurance Data collection is an important component of evaluation and it is necessary that the data collected be accurate and of optimum quality. The process for collecting this data should also be efﬁcient in terms of time and costs. The process of data collection can be divided into multiple stages as shown below. The agency will establish the following mechanisms at each of the levels to ensure that the data collected is quality ensured: 5.1 Before data collection ● Tool designing. ● Translation - The tool will be translated in Hindi. Translated tools undergo a proofreading exercise for checking the consistency and accuracy of the translation. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 21 --- Page 22 --- JK Cem ent Nim bahera -Im pact Assessm ent The language in the questionnaire needs to be as accurate as possible to avoid confusion or misunderstanding. ● Designing the tool with validations, skip logics and including Hindi translations in Survey CTO. ● Recruiting, Training and Piloting ○ Recruitment - They are the experienced ﬁeld researchers with domain knowledge who are selected within the pool of trained enumerators and supervisors. Depending upon the stakeholder gender proportion a corresponding ratio of male and female enumerators will be used for this study. The team will be driven by the Senior Supervisor and Monitored by the Field Manage. ○ Training - Core research team along with domain experts and supervisor heading the Field staff training. Training would entail information on project background, introduction of partners, Objective of the Impact assessment survey, Survey Protocols and Process, Quality of Data, Sampling method, Replacement strategy for drop-out/denials, selection of the right respondent, probing methods, and time frame. The identiﬁed ﬁeld investigators and supervisors will be trained on the ﬁnal tool. The teams will then be trained on administering the tool using CAPI. Two days in-house training with mock drills followed by a practical exposure to a sample village to get a better hold on the tools and data quality. Review and hand holding support will be carried out after practical exposure ○ Mock surveys - After the training is completed, mock surveys are conducted within the team. This identiﬁed the areas that need training and also provided handholding support to the FIs and FSs. This will also help enumerators get hands-on training of the CAPI application ○ Pilot - The core ﬁeld research team will be oriented on the project background, objectives, sample and pilot villages in discussion with local partners. CAPI orientation will be provided before moving for the pilot. Two researchers will go to a village as discussed and agreed with a local partner and conduct the pilot of 5 samples and prepare the feedback and experience. The pilot experiences and feedback on survey tools shared for further action. ● Post pilot changes feedback and changes incorporated in the design of the ﬁnal tool in SurveyCTO. The tool will be frozen for data collection. ● The ﬁeld work will be initiated in a sample location. First day data will be submitted to the Analyst and Quality controller to give feedback on data quality. Any discrepancies will be addressed before going for the next phase of data collection. Field work carried out to complete the sample as per sampling framework is shared. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The proposed CAPI will capture this and will show the progress at each level (FI, FS, Location). ○ Average time taken - Based on the results of the paper-based pilots and the pilots undertaken using the CAPI designed, average time to be taken for each section and the tool will be identiﬁed. Analytics will be available ﬁeld investigator wise which can be compared against the standard set. This will help identify investigators who need support. ○ Back check forms - Smaller forms can be designed on top of the existing tool as the back-check form. These forms will be synced to the original form through unique question labels and household ID. 5% of the respondents will be sampled randomly from each ﬁeld investigator. Back checks were done using these forms and through telephonic interviews. Data on the following will be collected: ■ Conﬁrmation of ﬁeld work carried out ■ Conﬁrmation of the time taken to conduct the interview ■ Response on key indicators ■ Feedback on the process of data collection ● Detailed documentation will be maintained of the quality checks done on the ﬁeld. The errors that arise on the ﬁeld can be categorised into the following: ○ Need for retraining on using and understanding the tool. ○ Need for retraining on using CAPI. ○ Need for retraining on asking and probing the questions in the most accurate and appropriate way. ● Ethical issues like fudging data etc. ○ Based on the severity of the error, either retraining and handholding support will be provided through ﬁeld supervisors. In case of ethical issues or misappropriation of data, the ﬁeld investigator will be terminated, and the data collected by him will be re-collected by replacement team members. ● Back check forms analysis - Data collected using the back-check forms will be analysed and available ﬁeld investigator wise to monitor the quality of data collection. ● Spot check - As ﬁeld investigators operate with a high degree of independence and ﬂexibility, random and unannounced spot check visits will be used to check on data collection activities. The following will be the key observation parameters: ● Methods of asking questions and probing Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

In-Depth interviews/Key Informant Interviews: In the proposal stage, identiﬁed a set of key stakeholders who have collective opinions which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. For example, School teachers, Education department ofﬁcials’, community youth leaders and SMCs individual perspectives and attitudes determine the support and effectiveness of the interventions. Systems and documentation review: The role of ﬁdelity and process adherence would be reviewed against set SoPs, documents, reported and unreported information. They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. These qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. Qualitative data can consist of interview notes, transcripts, participant observation ﬁeld notes etc. We will prepare thematic coding to identify patterns in data. The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the KIIs using software such as Nvivo or Atlas.ti. Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative data analysis the Theory of Change envisioned in the program will be reviewed through the exercise of Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. A critical review of the Theory of Change will allow us to identify the Causal Assumptions and Implementation assumptions . This will be critical to capture key aspects that would challenge the program’s success and failure. 3.2 A timetable/implementation plan Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 17 --- Page 18 --- Based on the overall scope of work and for the planned evaluations, a work plan is developed. The study will be rolled out in six stages: Stage 1: Inception Meeting - In the inception meeting, CMS will discuss the planned evaluations with the JK Cement team. Accordingly, CMS’s core team and expert/knowledge partners would conduct a comprehensive desk review of the project and other documents and develop the ﬁeld visit plan, overall study framework and methods. This stage will be completed within the ﬁrst week from the date of signing the contract. Stage 2: Detailed methodology, Inception report and Field visit plan – Planning discussions will be carried out with the JK Cement team regarding logistics, resource availability and facilitation for the planned evaluations and ﬁeld visits. Based on these, an inception report would be submitted for the planned evaluations with the design of the respective evaluations/studies, their proposed methodology and sampling plans and a detailed plan on the sequence of activities (including list of interviews, focus group discussions, etc. and the ﬁeld visit plan). These will be in accordance with the scope of work and the prescribed timelines. Stage 3: Study instruments development – Two weeks will be utilised for the development of study instruments, questionnaire design and ﬁeld team induction and training. Once the tools have been designed, the ﬁnalisation of the framework and survey operations will be done with the JK Cement team. CMS will furnish completed tools and make required modiﬁcations in two weeks for each planned evaluation. Stage 4: Analysis of quantitative &amp;amp; Qualitative data - Post the ﬁeld data collection a comprehensive process of data cleaning along with data preparation and warehousing would happen. During this phase, a dedicated data analysis team of experts will be involved and coordinating the data handling aspects from the CMS team. Analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team and discussions with the project team will take place. During this period, dedicated two consultations with the project team is expected. Post the data cleaning activity, data analysis will be front ended by the data analysis team in STATA according to the agreed speciﬁcations and outputs. Finalised data sets and codebook after quality veriﬁcation and responses to queries will be submitted as a deliverable during this Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Based on preliminary analysis of quantitative data, a questionnaire for qualitative data collection will be developed. Post tool development, FGDs will be carried out to collect qualitative data. Stage 5: Presentation on Topline ﬁndings and datasets : We would furnish cleaned and coded primary data (including qualitative transcripts) and analysis with the JK Cement team. Provide a presentation to the team on the high-level ﬁndings on completion of ﬁeld visits with analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team and discussions with the JK Cement team as key observations. Stage 6: Analysis and reporting: A draft report for baseline evaluation will be presented to the JK Cement team. The Final report would be concise and will be structured around following sections: ● List of acronyms and abbreviations ● Table of contents ● Executive summary ● Introduction ● Methodology, implementation details, and limitations ● Findings and discussions ● Conclusion and recommendations Annexures- Survey instruments: questionnaires, interview guides, maps, graphics, etc. as applicable We would ﬁnalise the reports for each evaluation based on the review and feedback from MBIF. We will deliver a presentation of ﬁndings to the JK Cement team and relevant stakeholders for each evaluation will be made. Accordingly, we will submit ﬁnal reports and dissemination briefs. In order to adhere to the timelines for the deliverable we have delineated the support/dependencies, which is attached in Annexure 3 3.3 High Level work plan for the Evaluation Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 19 --- Page 20 --- 3.4 Confidentiality and Ethical Considerations Ensuring anonymity and protecting respondent identity is a mandatory requirement, and our organisation adheres to stringent protocols for maintaining the highest level of conﬁdentiality. We have implemented robust measures to safeguard data security and privacy across our digital tools and platforms, including encryption of survey forms and clear guidelines for enumerators on data sharing, accompanied by conﬁdentiality contracts. Our enumerators undergo comprehensive training to remain unbiased and refrain from sharing any personal opinions, claims, or identifying information. They are bound by a conﬁdentiality agreement with CMS, committing to the proper use of conﬁdential information solely for the designated purposes outlined in their training, and not disclosing it to any third party. Additionally, our enumerators are instructed not to copy, retain, or share any written information that could potentially reveal identifying features of individuals, and all conﬁdential information, such as questionnaires, notes, photographs, and memoranda, is handed over to the team upon the conclusion of the surveys. 3.5 Quality Control Mechanism With over 200 projects and an in-house portfolio for data collection, CMS has strong expertise in ensuring quality data collection and follows strong protocols in the data collection process. This becomes especially relevant in the post pandemic scenario wherein the team has been following stringent guidelines around safety and hygiene, following international standards. After the questionnaire is ﬁnalised in consultation with JK Cement , researchers from the CMS team will conduct a pilot in the ﬁeld to ensure that the tool is well tailored to the location, project context as well as a cultural point of view. Once the post-pilot changes are Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 20 --- Page 21 --- completed, the tool is scripted and tested in-house (for skips and validations) by researchers and tested in a setting similar to that of the intended sample. Th e ﬁnal questionnaire is translated into local language by experienced thematic translators to retain the essence and yet contextualise for the local language. Translated tools undergo a proofreading exercise to check the consistency and accuracy of the translation by the research team who is well versed in local languages. Monitoring of data quality is the most important aspect of data collection. Poor quality data reduces the effectiveness of policy intervention, and can also require a repeat of the entire data collection process. Therefore, the research team sets clear guidelines and protocols for the monitoring and quality assurance that include maintaining a real-time MIS dashboard of collection, minimising non-response with 2-3 attempts, ensuring enumerator quality controls with spot checks, back checks (on major topics, time taken, etc.) and looping mechanisms. Data management is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect in the data collection process. The CMS team has robust processes, the quantitative data is stored online on secured servers synched in real-time that ensure data security. All hard copies of the research notes, qualitative interviews, etc. are scanned and JK Cement FOUNDATION uploaded almost in real-time to avoid any loss of data. The research team has strong experience in working with multiple scripting software such as Survey CTO, Commcare, ODK, etc. and experience in online data management. Data cleaning is perhaps the most critical step between data collection and data analysis. CMS believes that it is a rigorous process, and that the quality of the analysis is correlated to the quality of data cleaning. Most of the data validation exercise is completed in real-time to avoid post-cleaning efforts including id variable checking, outlier tagging, missing values and replacements, illogical value assessment, addressing typos, survey codes, missing values and adding labels. Irregularities and corrections are identiﬁed and documented, but changes are made only after introspection with the ﬁeld team and the qualitative insights. 3.6 Selection of Interviewers/Enumerators and their Training Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 21 --- Page 22 --- CMS has an expert network of senior enumerators Pan India with strong domain knowledge and past experience of working on assessment of Education related impact assessment projects. They are also trained on research ethics and the collection of sensitive information, etc. The selection of enumerators is based on stringent measures, and they are assessed for quality throughout the project. A detailed training and orienting process is designed at multiple levels, including the training of trainers. Training is provided on all aspects of data collection including programme background, objectives and scope of the study, sampling techniques and replacement methodology, discussion on each question with probing methods, logistics planning and support. A scientiﬁc approach to the training process is ensured by creating standard training protocols, manuals including standardisation in survey techniques. Key personnel including members of the research and ﬁeld supervisory team are present to enable the highest quality of data collection. Mock surveys and ﬁeld days are planned for the team for in-ﬁeld experience with the software and survey tool. During the pandemic, CMS has worked on remote data collection methods and alternate hybrid models that are enabled by in-person local facilitation and best use of technology (short message service (SMS), online surveys (web), computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), and interactive voice response (IVR)). CMS is open to working on a hybrid approach to data collection in consultation with the JK Cement. 4 Organisation and Stafﬁng 4.1 Proﬁles of Key Project Personnel Amit Gupta (Advisor) Amit Gupta is the Co-founder &amp;amp; Non-Executive Director, Callidus Social Enterprises which is a Bangalore based CSR project lifecycle management consulting ﬁrm, working with NGOs in capacity building and developing a SaaS model marketplace for CSR project execution, monitoring and evaluation, impact assessment through improved transparency and accountability from multiple stakeholders.

More than half of the participants from Puri were migrants. Around half of the respondents were from fisherfolk community followed by construction workers (35.4%) and farmers (9%) community. --- Slide 8 --- ‹#› N=1236 More than half (57%) of the respondents were unemployed. (higher proportion of women) Unemployment status is higher in Alwar when compared to Puri. N=532 N=1236 --- Slide 9 --- Gender Lens Majority of the females are unemployed in both the cities. Around 45% do not have income, of which majority are females in both the cities. Males are in the higher income brackets. More females in Puri have no formal education (67%) as compared to Alwar (43%) More females in Alwar are employed (33%) as compared to only 27% in Puri, however the difference is not very big. ‹#› --- Slide 10 --- Summary Around 68% of the respondents are females. Three quarters of the respondents are natives, remaining are migrants which majorly belong to Puri. Among the marginalised groups, around half of the respondents are from fisherfolk community who belong to Puri. Education status is better in Alwar, but the employment rate is better in Puri as half of the respondents are employed. ‹#› --- Slide 11 --- Access and Behaviour ‹#› This section provides information on awareness of respondents pertaining to access to health care facilities and services and health seeking behaviour. ‹#› --- Slide 12 --- ‹#› N=1236 Only 28% had a practice of undergoing health screening regularly, followed by half of the respondents who underwent health screening once in a while. Around 20% of the respondents strongly believed they did not need a health screening. Both the states had similar awareness around lifestyle diseases. Around 54% reported favorably in engaging regular physical activity, whereas around 38% strongly felt no need of engaging in regular physical activity. --- Slide 13 --- ‹#› N=1236 --- Slide 14 --- ‹#› N=1236 N=1236 Under the none category, 65% were females, and around 70% were farmers. Considerable proportion in Alwar (29.3%) preferred self-medication. --- Slide 15 --- ‹#› N=1236 N=1236 Only 1.4% in Puri has health facilities at &amp;gt;10kms, whereas in Alwar this proportion is 42% More than three quarters of the respondents took 0-30 minutes to access the healthcare facilities. Followed by 30-60 minutes (19%). --- Slide 16 --- ‹#› N=1236 Alwar waits while Puri acts… --- Slide 17 --- ‹#› N=1236 --- Slide 18 --- ‹#› N=1236 Most important reason was quality of care for 35%, followed by proximity (22.3%) and affordability (14%). --- Slide 19 --- ‹#› N=1236 Around 60% visited healthcare facilities for symptomatic care, followed by emergency care (17.4%), health screenings (13.1%) and routine check ups (10.2%). --- Slide 20 --- ‹#› 61% Ever Delayed seeking care in Alwar N=607 --- Slide 21 --- 43.4% Ever Delayed seeking care in Puri ‹#› N=629 --- Slide 22 --- ‹#› Mean: 600 Median: 300 Mode: 500 Min: 0 Max: 15000 Mean: 1325 Median: 800 Mode: 500 Min: 10 Max: 20000 --- Slide 23 --- Gender Lens Females from Puri engaged more regularly in physical activity than from Alwar. Significant proportion of females (18%) preferred self-medication. 90% of females in Puri have health facilities within 5 kms, whereas it is only for 60% in Alwar. Females in Alwar are 20 times more likely to wait for symptoms to get worse than females in Puri. In Alwar, more emergency care for females (25%) as compared to males (19%). No female in Puri take medications based on family/friends advice, but in Alwar &amp;lt;2% do. Key reasons for delaying care for females: lack of transportation and dependency of others. ‹#› --- Slide 24 --- ‹#› Awareness about lifestyle diseases is similar in both states, however behaviour to prevent lifestyle diseases is different. Puri practices a more regular behaviour to prevent lifestyle diseases when compared to Alwar. Similarly, around 40% in Puri undergoes health screenings on a regular basis, whereas, around 30% in Alwar expressed no need to undergo regular health screenings. About half of the respondents in Puri were engaged in regular physical activity, as compared to Alwar where around 60% strongly felt no need of physical activity. Summary --- Slide 25 --- Summary Around 60% in Puri prefer visiting a doctor in a health emergency, as compared to 26.3% in Alwar. Around 24% in Alwar do not have access to healthcare facilities, however, public and private healthcare facilities are largely available in both the states. Both the states have similar preferences over healthcare facilities however, in Alwar considerable proportion (~30%) would prefer home remedies. For about 90% of respondents in Puri, the facility is within the radius of 5kms, as compared to Alwar where it extends to 10kms for 42%. Top 3 reasons to select a healthcare facility: Alwar- Proximity, Quality of care and affordability of services. Puri- Quality of care, trust in the provider and affordability of services. Only 3.2% of the respondents in Puri wait for the symptoms to get severe, whereas in Alwar it is for ~19%. Average expenditure while visiting a healthcare facility in Puri exceed those in Alwar by more than double. The primary reasons respondents in Alwar delay seeking care are time constraints (58%), dependency on others (57%), remoteness of facilities (51%), and lack of transportation (50%). ‹#› --- Slide 26 --- Teleconsultation ‹#› This section provides information on community’s knowledge and need of a teleconsultation platform ‹#› --- Slide 27 --- ‹#› N=1236 More than 80% were not aware about the teleconsultation services. 22% natives were aware about these services as compared to only 11% migrants. More than 20% of farmers and construction workers were aware about these services, as compared to only 9% of fisherfolk. --- Slide 28 --- ‹#› N=232 Only 24% are accessing teleconsultation services. Of those who are accessing services, 80% were natives. N=232 More than 90% in both the states Found these services useful. All the migrants who were accessing these services Found them useful. --- Slide 29 --- ‹#› N=1236 63% Willing in Alwar to use the platform 32% Willing in Puri to use the platform 37% Unwilling in Alwar to use the platform 68% Unwilling in Puri to use the platform --- Slide 30 --- ‹#› N=1236 Around 40% preferred primary healthcare services in such a platform. Followed by symptomatic care (27%) and chronic illnesses (25.3%). Least preferred services were referrals (3.6%) and social protection (3.2%). Around 60% were not willing to pay for such services. Around 50% in Alwar had willingness as compared to only 30% in Puri --- Slide 31 --- ‹#› Maximum Willingness Min- 5 INR, Max- 10000 INR Mean- 208 INR Mode- 100 INR Minimum Willingness Min- 5 INR, Max- 5000 INR Mean- 76 INR Mode- 10 INR N=308 ALWAR --- Slide 32 --- Maximum Willingness Min- 100 INR, Max- 5000 INR Mean- 609 INR Mode- 500 INR ‹#› Minimum Willingness Min- 2 INR, Max- 4000 INR Mean- 260 INR Mode- 100 INR N=194 PURI --- Slide 33 --- Awareness 88.5% Key Schemes MNREGA, Labor card, E-shram, Ayushman Bharat ‹#› Of the unenrolled, 56.5% are from Alwar, 66% are females, 40% are migrants, 41% are fisherfolk.

About the program The Government Partnership Programme , initiated by Magic Bus India Foundation, focuses on equipping government school teachers with the necessary skills to provide life skills education to adolescents. The initiative is designed to foster the holistic development of adolescents, enhancing their resilience, self-efﬁcacy, and agency skills. Recognizing the pressing need for such a program, it addresses the fact that a signiﬁcant portion of Indian adolescents lack essential life skills required for employment or managing daily life activities. The initiative not only supports adolescents in continuing their education and setting career goals but also aligns with the new National Education Policy commitments. By partnering with foundation, Michael &amp;amp; Susan Dell Foundation and collaborating with Haryana government, Magic Bus aspires to impact young lives, promoting skill and education. Through this, the project aims to provide young people with the necessary tools and resources to lead fulﬁlling lives and pursue successful careers. Life Skills Education for Adolescents In this program these students will undergo a transformative educational experience, as they will be equipped with essential life skills (cognitive, social and emotional) consisting of 11 skills and 35 competencies that are crucial for thriving in the 21st century. These skills include effective communication, critical thinking and problem solving, collaborative teamwork, and self-awareness, among others. CMS envisages many interlinkages within the studies that can feed into one another and create comprehensive evidence for outcomes, learnings and scaling up of the overall project strategy. The study framework will have a comprehensive desk review and followed by the evaluation under the framework. 2 --- Page 4 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 1.1 Objective and scope of evaluation The overall objectives of the study are : A.

Capturing the key learnings, which we need to forget to drop bad practices, relearn from the mishaps and redo the best practices. The study will provide the baseline values for key indicators of the programme. The data generated through this study will help to measure the outcomes and impact of the programme at the endline level. The key activities in the baseline assessment will involve collection of both 3 --- Page 5 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study quantitative and qualitative data for using various tools mentioned in the analytical framework. The evaluation will include analysing the changes in key indicators, understanding the factors that contributed to the outcomes. 1.2 Literature review Critical challenges in capitalising the demographic dividend of youth commences in validating the socio-economic context of households. More than 12 million young girls and boys between 15 and 29 years of age are expected to enter India’s labour force every year for the next two decades. As of 2022, India houses 362 million under the age of 15 and under the age of 5 is 114 Million according to World Stats data (Ritchie,2021) and in 2032 it would be 330 Million under the age of 15. The progress of adolescents to pursue higher education and become empowered and responsible citizens of society could be inﬂuenced by decisions of the parents and their beliefs and practices. Caste, gender, poverty and location continue to pose barriers for many young people to realise their full potential. Various types of literature were reviewed such as the following: 1) UDISE-Dashboard and Reports 2) NITI Aayog- School Education Quality Index 3) UNICEF Life Skills Framework 4) ILO Skills Framework 5) All India Survey on Higher Education Current education system focuses on imparting knowledge-based concepts rather than prioritising skill development, fostering positive attitudes, and instilling core values. Life skills are deﬁned as &amp;quot;abilities for adaptive positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life&amp;quot; (WHO. 1993) 1 . Life skills, from this perspective are essentially those abilities which help to promote mental well-being and competence in young people as they face the realities of life. Life skills education revolves around instructing individuals in essential skills that are applicable to their everyday lives. Life skills, when taught as generic skills for life, are taught in the context of holistic health and social issues, such as relationships, learning about social inﬂuences on behaviour and learning about rights and responsibilities (WHO, 1996 2 ). This form of education encompasses the development and application of skills, particularly in addressing signiﬁcant health and social concerns. The educational approach involves actively engaging children and adolescents in a dynamic process of teaching and learning, frequently 2 Division of Mental Health and Prevention of Substance Abuse. (1991). World Health Organization, Geneva. 1 Training workshops for the development and implementation of life skills program. (1993). Division of Mental Health World Health Organization Geneva. 4 --- Page 6 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study drawing upon the principles of social learning theory (Bandura, 1977). Life skills has been identiﬁed as an essential resource for developing psychosocial, emotional, cognitive, behavioural and resilience skills to negotiate every day challenges and productive involvement in the community (Desai, 2010 3 ). These skills play a vital role in helping young individuals effectively navigate and resolve the difﬁculties they encounter while striving to become active and valuable members of society. The purpose of life skills training is to facilitate the acquisition of skills that have a direct impact on health and behaviour within the social environment. Today&amp;#x27;s Indian adolescents have more information and cultural alternatives than before, but economic dependence on parents limits their ability to make choices. To succeed globally and become independent adults, they need to enhance their psychosocial competencies through life skills training. This training equips them with the necessary skills to navigate a competitive and rapidly changing world (Narasimha &amp;amp; Rao, 2011 4 ). India, with its vast population, faces numerous challenges in the education and skill development sector, particularly for adolescents. It has been observed that while nearly all children are enrolled in primary schools, the transition to higher education remains low, with only 33% progressing to Grade 11 and a mere 10% pursuing higher education. Furthermore, workforce participation rates are declining in rural areas, and gender disparities in salaried employment persist, posing signiﬁcant barriers to economic empowerment and social progress. Recognizing the critical need to address these challenges, the Magic Bus India Foundation (MBIF) has initiated the &amp;quot;Government Partnership Programme in Haryana.&amp;quot; This program aims to provide life skills education to adolescents from underserved backgrounds, empowering them with the necessary tools to navigate their journey from childhood to livelihood. By focusing on skill development and fostering a supportive environment, the program seeks to bridge the gap between required skills and available opportunities, ultimately enabling adolescents to make informed decisions about their futures. The Government Partnership Programme in Haryana is being implemented in collaboration with the Department of Education, Haryana, and Samagra Governance. It will be conducted in three districts: Gurugram, Panchkula, and Yamuna Nagar. The program targets an outreach of 80,009 adolescents and 1,358 teachers across 679 schools in the academic year 2023-24. The curriculum will be delivered to students in Classes 6 to 8 through a cohort-based approach, with a transition to higher grades in subsequent years. The program adopts an innovative teacher-led model, wherein teachers are trained to deliver life skills education sessions to students. Each academic year, students will receive 48 hours of activity-based experiential learning sessions, focusing on knowledge, skill, and attitude development. The sessions will be designed to encourage student participation, reﬂection, and behaviour change. Magic Bus School Support Ofﬁcers (SSOs) will be assigned to approximately 10-12 schools to provide training, mentoring, and monitoring support to teachers, ensuring the effective implementation of the program. 4 Life skills education for young adolescents - Indian experience 3 A narrative systematic review of life skills education: effectiveness, research gaps and priorities. International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 24(3), 362–379 5 --- Page 7 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study “The obsession with Cognitive skills obscures the fact that socio-emotional skills have a greater effect on life success. Quality early childhood education provides a persistent boost in socio-emotional skills even if cognitive skills diminish in the short run.”- Professor James Heckman Development of skills will contribute to achieve tangible outcomes in four separate yet interrelated areas: ● The achievement of a knowledge society through improved education outcomes. ● The realisation of economic development through improved employment and entrepreneurship. ● The attainment of enhanced social cohesion through improved civic engagement. ● The empowerment of each individual through life skills so they can develop a clear and evolving understanding of themselves in the world, accompanied by increasing agency and assets. 1.3 Key initiatives from the government National Curriculum Framework of 2005 The Life Skills and Civic Education division actively supports life skills education in all government schools in Delhi, encompassing ten core skills crucial for holistic development. These skills empower children with the abilities to make informed choices, manage their emotions, and communicate effectively. Aligned with the National Curriculum Framework of 2005, which emphasises constructive learning experiences and values, CBSE introduced life skills education in 2005 for classes 6 to 10, along with manuals for classes 6, 7, and 8. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) places a strong emphasis on life skills training, especially for upper primary girls. Furthermore, the division spearheads civic education through the SCERT&amp;#x27;s YUVA cell, striving to cultivate responsible, healthy, and thoughtful citizens. Samagra Shiksha Samagra Shiksha - an overarching programme implemented by the Central Government for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class 12. SS covers the entire school education sector starting from Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) to senior secondary level and adopts a holistic/systemic approach in supporting, among others, strategic interventions of States/UT s to improve equitable access, retention and learning outcomes, given the geo-physical and socioeconomic contexts of States/UT s. It subsumes the three erstwhile Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). 6 --- Page 8 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study An updated version of the SS framework is passed through a Government Order in October 2022 . This is an alignment to New Education Policy 2020 and promoting the core objectives of SS-promoting Access, Retention, Learning Outcomes, Capacity building of Teachers, SMCs, Strengthening of Teacher Education Institutions, Bridging Gender and Social Gaps, Inclusion, Vocational Education, Community mobilisation, Data capturing and Monitoring of progress. The SS program could have a significant contribution towards the outcomes mapped in ToCs and augment the outcomes in delaying early marriage of girl children, ensuring transition to higher education and minimising dropouts. ‘No School Bag Day’ Happy students make better learners. With this aim in mind, the Haryana Education Department is currently developing a framework to introduce activity-based learning in government schools. Additionally, Saturdays are now designated solely for extra-curricular activities in schools to enhance students&amp;#x27; skills. A change in pedagogy is being implemented, starting with the primary classes. Instead of rote learning, a variety of activities are being introduced. Experts from the ﬁelds of science and mathematics are called upon to interact with students and assist them in understanding the fundamental concepts (Min. of Education Haryana, 2016) Skill Passbook Initiative by Haryana Govt. The provision of Skill Passbooks and the implementation of the Catch-up Program are ongoing for the current academic year. During the ﬁrst week, the process begins with a skill review and the identiﬁcation of students. Teachers in each class review their students&amp;#x27; skill passbooks to ensure they accurately reﬂect the students&amp;#x27; competency levels in reading, writing in languages, and numeracy skills from the previous year. Students who require assistance with skill enhancement are identiﬁed, along with those who have already achieved proﬁciency. The latter group will support their peers in catching up on what they missed in the previous class, acting as valuable resource persons and mentors. Welfare schemes Beside the above schemes, the following incentives and support are provided by the Government to the students. They are speciﬁc to certain grades but provided to all students in the respective classes. They will augment the enrolment, attendance, reduce drop and complete education, successfully. 7 --- Page 9 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 2. Survey instrument review and ﬁnalisation Mapping the requirements and the baseline assessment, CMS and MagicBus Foundation collectively have frozen the potential survey instruments presented below along with its activities. The tools would be developed in line with the Baseline indicators. 3. Description of Approach, Methodology and Work Plan 3.1 Research Methodology This is a mixed-method study employing a non-experimental design at the baseline, where quantitative methods will be used to capture the baseline status of the program. This baseline survey will focus on only the 3 districts of Haryana State. The qualitative methods are applied after the quantitative methods and used to elaborate, connect, enhance, illustrate and clarify the ﬁndings of the quantitative component, leading to a more in-depth exploration of the ﬁndings and understanding of the association between program output and the ﬁnal impact. 8 --- Page 10 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study Figure 2: Flow of Research Methodology 9 --- Page 11 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 3.1.1 Evaluation Framework- Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) model The evaluation framework used for analysing various tools is adapted from the Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) Model. The Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model, also referred to as the Knowledge, Attitudes, Belief, and Practices (KABP) survey, is a methodological instrument that was ﬁrst developed as a means to understand family planning practices around the world (Cleland, 1973; Ratcliffe, 1976). Originating from the ﬁelds of family planning and population studies in the 1960s, the KAP model was developed and recognized as a popular survey instrument in the ﬁeld of social research; it can be used to assess the relationship among knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Scholars have utilised the KAP survey framework to understand Life skill Education of students (United Nations Population Fund, Austrian Development Agency and Ministry of Education, Culture and Research, 2021). The KAP survey framework primarily measures, as the name suggests, three aspects of Life skill behaviour (1) The knowledge that individuals have regarding life skill education, mainly referring to knowledge in terms of life skills gained; (2) The attitudes that individuals hold toward perception of parents and students towards life skill education and (3) The practices that individuals partake in, with regards to addressing an issue. Previous studies have identiﬁed many interconnections among knowledge, attitudes, and practices ( Valente et al., 1998 ). In the current study we will evaluate the Information gathered in terms of knowledge, attitude, practises relationship and explore how the knowledge of issues and possession of skills are required for behavioural change which would lead to the formation of behavioural intention. In addition to above KAP surveys would help reveal misconceptions or misunderstandings that may represent obstacles to the activities that we would like to implement and potential barriers to behaviour change (USAID, 2023) 10 --- Page 12 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 3.1.2 Analytical Framework- Sustainability, Impact and Scale (REEIS Framework) A comprehensive review of project documents (project documents, guidelines, results framework, annual reports, MIS data, standard operating procedures, etc) will give us a strong understanding of the effectiveness, efﬁciency and coverage and progress of the model. This in turn will require analysis through the lens of REEIS framework. The entire process is geared towards achieving Sustainability, Impact and Scale which will be detrimental towards achieving the program’s end goal. This analytical framework thus identiﬁes the process monitoring questions that will evaluate the Design, Implementation, Impact &amp;amp; Sustainability of the program. 11 --- Page 13 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 3.1.3 Sampling The Baseline survey will have quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative component will involve, a) quantitative survey of students; b) quantitative survey of parents; c) quantitative survey at School level; d) quantitative survey at village level. And the qualitative component will involve Key Informant Interviews &amp;amp; Focus Group Discussions with Govt. Ofﬁcials, Community members and other stakeholders. The details of these components are given below: Quantitative Sample Quantitative survey of students The student baseline assessment will be carried out by the CSSL tool. Students studying in class 6 to 8 will be the primary respondents for the survey. In addition to students from class 6 to 8, students from class 9 will also be administered the CSSL tool at the baseline. These students will be treated as comparison at the time of endline. needed. The total sample size for the state (3 districts) will be 3600 students. The sample size is determined on 95% conﬁdence, 5% percent of margin of error, factor of interest at 50% with design effect of 2. With the above provision the break-up of the sample number across district and class wise is as below SNo. Districts Class 6 Class 7 Class 8 Class 9 School 1 Panchkula 300 300 300 300 30 2 Gurugram 300 300 300 300 30 3 Yamunanagar 300 300 300 300 30 4 Total 900 900 900 900 90 The Sample Schools from each district are selected using Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling method.

In total, 1800 (20 parents per school) parents will be interviewed in three target districts. The breakup of the parent sample by district is as below Quantitative survey at School level &amp;amp; Village level In addition to the Student &amp;amp; Parent tool, a quantitative tool at village and school level will also be administered. The total sample size for the school tool is 90 and for the village tool is 24. Qualitative Sample A total of 33 qualitative interactions (18 KIIs &amp;amp; 15 FGDs) will be conducted.

Inferential Statistics Inferential statistics have two main uses: making estimates about populations,. testing hypotheses to draw conclusions about populations. There are two main types of inferential statistics - hypothesis testing and regression analysis-Multiple-ANOVA/Multiple Linear Regression and the applicable ones. In the Baseline, we may identify co-relations and establish causal relationships are almost impossible. Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics will initially be done with frequency tables and cross-tabulations. Further heterogeneity analysis will be conducted to further unpack the impacts at various sub-group levels. Heterogeneity Analysis Role of externalities: CMS does not have a directional hypothesis about how the programme will differentially affect individuals and who support interventions and those who are not. It is possible that program participants might beneﬁt more from the programme as they already have access to credit and other institutional beneﬁts. The quantitative household assessment will be facilitated with qualiﬁed enumerators through a CAPI administered tool. The qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations will help to understand enabling pathways and barriers that can improve the implementation model and generate best practice and systemic process documents that can be taken as evidence for scaling up. These qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. Vulnerability Analysis The study intends to document a few cases from the personal interviews along with the grading assessment that would represent “higher impact beneﬁciaries” and “lower impact beneﬁciaries needing further augmentation”, to understand the contextual and operational constraints or opportunities that can explain their speciﬁc trajectories. 19 --- Page 21 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 3.2.2 Qualitative Evaluation This would attempt to capture the perspectives of key stakeholders upon the Life Skills Education program. The underlying reasons, motivations, collective opinions, and key narratives would be captured. Figure Qualitative evaluation framework Theories and narratives would be reviewed as a group, an individual and tested among speciﬁc individuals as case studies. Focus Group Discussion: In the proposal stage, identify a set of key stakeholders who have individual perspectives and roles which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. For example, parents would share the credibility and recognition of Life Skills Education interventions considering their socio-economic challenges. In-Depth interviews/Key Informant Interviews: In the proposal stage, identiﬁed a set of key stakeholders who have collective opinions which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. For example, teachers and Education department ofﬁcials’ individual perspectives and attitudes determine the support and effectiveness of the interventions. Systems and documentation review: The role of ﬁdelity and process adherence would be reviewed against set SoPs, documents, reported and unreported information. They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative data analysis the Theory of Change envisioned in the program will be reviewed through the exercise of Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. A critical review of the Theory of Change will allow us to identify the Causal Assumptions and Implementation assumptions . To understand the implementation assumptions, 20 --- Page 22 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study it is necessary to empathise with the student’s journey from primary to successful completion in Life skill development. This will be critical to capture key aspects that would challenge the program’s success and failure. 3.3 Final team composition The Project Lead will work closely under the guidance of the thematic advisors to develop a robust methodology to assess the impact of the MAGIC BUS FOUNDATION’s COVID-19 Humanitarian interventions. Amit Gupta, will be Thematic Technical advisor who would provide subject matter inputs on agri-based livelihoods, agri-market linkage and Skill development programs. The project lead will monitor and ensure that everything is on track and the deliverables under the focus areas are submitted on time. The project lead will supervise three teams of qualitative specialists, quantitative specialists and the ﬁeld team. Quantitative and qualitative teams will comprise team leads, senior researchers and research associates from CMS. A brief proﬁle of the proposed personnel is presented below. Thematic Technical Advisor- Amit Gupta is the Co-founder &amp;amp; Non-Executive Director, Callidus Social Enterprises which is a Bangalore based CSR project lifecycle management consulting ﬁrm, working with NGOs in capacity building and developing a SaaS model marketplace for CSR project execution, monitoring and evaluation, impact assessment through improved transparency and accountability from multiple stakeholders. Project Lead- Karthikeyan Elangeswaran has a decade of unique blend of experience, in the ﬁelds of Social Impact Management, CSR, not-for-proﬁt sectors and Corporate Sustainable Development. He is passionate to advance the value creation with evidence-based research and bringing ﬁndings from ﬁeld observations though qualitative interactions and participatory rural appraisals. He constructively challenges the status quo and approaches feasible solutions.

Field Manager- Dr. Khushwant Singh has over 22 years of experience in managing evaluations of all scales and designs that cut across various domains such as agriculture, health, education, rural development and livelihoods. As the Field Research Manager at CMS, his expertise lies in identifying and recruiting thematic and geography speciﬁc ﬁeld researchers, conducting training on real time data collection through electronic tools, ensuring development and implementation of quality assurance protocols. The team will be led by the Project Lead, Karthikeyan E, under the advisory of Amit Gupta. The project lead will be supported by the quantitative and qualitative research teams, and the ﬁeld team. The Project Lead will act as an interface between the research team. Team Leads, Senior Researchers, Research Associates, Field Managers and Data Managers will report to the Project Manager. The Project Manager will supervise and manage the quantitative team, the qualitative team, and the ﬁeld team. The quantitative and qualitative research teams will be involved in the study design phase. However, all three teams will be involved in the quantitative and qualitative data collection, analysis and synthesization. They will also take part in Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and KIIs at select points in time. The enumerator’s role will primarily be data collection. Whereas Supervisors will supervise the ﬁeld data collection process as well as conduct back 21 --- Page 23 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study checks for data quality assurance. Qualitative Field Investigators will be responsible for conducting FGDs and documenting the ﬁeld-level ﬁndings. They will be stationed at the ﬁeld location. 3.4 Work Plan and Roadmap The study will be rolled out in three stages of Inception &amp;amp; Review meeting (A), Survey Operations (B), and Analysis &amp;amp; Baseline Report (C). Overview of the work plan with timelines is provided in the ﬁgure below. Based on the overall scope of work and planned evaluations, a work plan has been developed and presented below. The study will be rolled out in six stages: Stage 1: Inception Meeting(Completed) - In the inception meeting, CMS will discuss the planned evaluations with the NGO team. Accordingly, CMS’s core team and expert/knowledge partners would conduct a comprehensive desk review of the project and other documents and develop the ﬁeld visit plan, overall study framework and methods. This stage will be completed within the ﬁrst week from the date of signing the contract. Stage 2: Detailed Methodology, Inception Report and Field Visit Plan(Completed) – Planning discussions will be carried out with the MBIF team regarding logistics, resource availability and facilitation for the planned evaluations and ﬁeld visits. Based on these, an inception report would be submitted for the planned evaluations with the design of the respective evaluations/studies, their proposed methodology and sampling plans and a detailed plan on the sequence of activities (including list of interviews, household surveys, focus group discussions, etc. and the ﬁeld visit plan). These will be in accordance with the scope of work and the prescribed timelines. Stage 3: Study Instrument Development – Two weeks will be utilised for the development of study instruments, questionnaire design and ﬁeld team induction and training. Once the tools have been designed, the ﬁnalisation of the framework and survey operations will be done with the MBIF team. CMS will furnish completed tools and make required modiﬁcations in two weeks for each planned evaluation. Stage 4: Stakeholder Engagement and Debrieﬁng Note - For each planned evaluation, three weeks of ﬁeld survey will be conducted, covering the identiﬁed stakeholders. Three or four teams from CMS and our expert partners will be engaged in this process. A debrieﬁng note will be submitted upon completion of ﬁeld visits with key observations, survey dashboard and WhatsApp group updates. 22 --- Page 24 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study Stage 5: Presentation on High level Findings and Datasets - CMS will share cleaned and coded primary data (including qualitative transcripts) and analysis for each evaluation with MBIF. The planned evaluation for each will be presented, accounting for three weeks of data analysis. Once completed, CMS will make a presentation to the MBIF team for each planned evaluation on high-level ﬁndings from the (i) analysis of the ﬁeld data, (ii) reﬂections from the internal team and (iii) discussions with the MBIF project team. Stage 6: Analysis and Reporting – CMS will submit a draft report for each evaluation to MBIF. The report will be concise and structured around the following sections: ● List of acronyms and abbreviations ● Table of contents ● Executive summary ● Introduction ● Methodology, implementation details, and limitations ● Findings and discussions ● Conclusion and recommendations Annexures- Survey instruments: questionnaires, interview guides, maps, graphics, etc. as applicable 23 --- Page 25 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 3.5 Work plan with deliverables (Tentative- Subject to Discussion) Description Month - 1 (Novemeber) Month -2 Month -3 Month -4 W1 W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 W1 W2 W3 W4 Contracting and Inception Contracting agreements Inception workshop with the Key Stakeholders at MB - Understanding expectations, Decisions on Overall design Final inception report Study methodology and questionnaire design Study Design and Tools (Parents Survey/FGD/KIIs) Final Study Tools Data Collection Field Team Training - Student &amp;amp; School Survey Field Roll Out - Student Survey (School assessment tool) &amp;amp; School Survey Field Team Training - Parent Survey &amp;amp; Village survey (Including Pilot testing) 24 --- Page 26 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study Field Roll Out - Parents Survey &amp;amp; Village survey Qualitative ﬁeld team training - Qualitative Survey Qualitative Survey Field Work Completion report Data analysis and presentation Data consolidation and cleaning Preliminary data analysis and topline ﬁndings Data analysis Data presentation - PPTs and draft report Final report submission *Contingent upon the state restrictions and adequate permissions, the work plan may differ based on the timelines scheduled above *Fortnight calls to have regular updates on project management *Dependencies, responsibilities and support are shared in the Role Matrix Table 10 Work Plan 25 --- Page 27 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 4.Data Collection and Quality Assurance Ensuring a good quality assurance of the ﬁeld survey will go a long way in ensuring high quality data. The quality assurance of the ﬁeld research will be ensured through the following process: ● Detailed overall planning for ﬁeld work, which will be monitored closely, every day, in terms of survey tasks planned, survey tasks achieved and variance. ● Each interview will be tracked via GPS location, which will be automated and done for all the interviews. ● The research team and the Field Manager will also make monitoring visits to appraise the quality of evaluation and monitoring tasks performed by the on-ﬁeld team and provide feedback. ● The Field Manager will maintain a spreadsheet containing the details of the enumerator-wise number of completed surveys against the target. This document will be shared with the relevant stakeholders of the programme team. ● Monitoring dashboards will be prepared by the research team to understand the progress made on the data collection front and triangulate it on a daily basis with the document maintained by the Field Manager. ● The research team will check for outliers and variations in real-time and give feedback to the on-ﬁeld data collection team. The team then either makes corrections or retains the data with valid reasoning, thus reducing the post-collection cleaning effort. ● During the process of data collection, the research team and ﬁeld data collection teamwork in tandem, ensuring to close loops with each other over daily calls and weekly/bi-monthly calls with the funding organisations. ● Online support and monitoring visits will ensure the veracity of the data and the thoroughness of qualitative information. Monitoring visits will bring in the qualitative information that will feed into the monitoring of quantitative data. ● Spot-check visits – Random and unannounced visits will be done by the State Coordinators and Supervisors to the ﬁeld location of each ﬁeld team to cross-check the accuracy and completeness of data. This will also be an opportunity to do the following: ● Check if the ﬁeld investigator interviewed the correct, desired and intended respondents. ● Obtain information from the household members on whether a reported visit (by the ﬁeld investigator) was indeed made. ● Find out about the ﬁeld investigator’s conduct during visits. ● Discuss any concerns of community (Registered/ sample/target population) during the process of ﬁeld work ● Verify events that have been reported by the ﬁeld investigator. ● Back-Check - The back-check will be done by the Supervisors. The interviewees will be contacted telephonically and at least 5% of the key indicators will be checked for their authenticity and accuracy. This will also be done randomly for each Field Research team. 26 --- Page 28 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study ● Monitoring Refusals - Number of refusals to participate in the survey and reasons will be tracked and monitored closely. Number of visits done to each household will also be monitored and documented. Considering the prevailing scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, enumerators will be provided with the PPE kits to ensure the safety of both, the respondent and enumerator. 4.1 Data Entry and Management Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) using handheld tablets will be used for data collection during the survey. CMS has more than 300 android tablets which will be deployed for the data collection as and when needed. SurveyCTO will be used for data collection. SurveyCTO is a data collection platform that enables anyone to build applications for data collection, both desktop and tablet/mobile based. SurveyCTO is one of the most widely adopted, technically advanced, and evidence-based mobile platforms for low-resource settings. The key features include: ● Create a custom app ● Collect information ofﬂine ● Track data over-time ● Support complex workﬂows ● Data stored on secure cloud server ● Access real-time reports ● Vernacular Forms ● Validations and logic ﬂows ● Easy monitoring and reporting of data 5. Quality assurance Data collection is an important component of evaluation and it is necessary that the data collected be accurate and of optimum quality. The process for collecting this data should also be efﬁcient in terms of time and costs. The process of data collection can be divided into multiple stages as shown below. The agency will establish the following mechanisms at each of the levels to ensure that the data collected is quality ensured: 5.1 Before data collection ● Tool designing with validations and skip logic (Shared by MagicBus Foundation) ● Translation - The tool will be translated in Tamil. Translated tools undergo a proofreading exercise for checking the consistency and accuracy of the translation. The language in the questionnaire needs to be as accurate as possible to avoid confusion or misunderstanding. ● Designing the tool with validations, skip logics and including Tamil translations in Survey CTO. ● Recruiting, Training and Piloting 27 --- Page 29 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study ○ Recruitment - They are the experienced ﬁeld researchers with domain knowledge who are selected within the pool of trained and ethical certiﬁed enumerators from the Community Engagement unit of CMS. Depending upon the stakeholder gender proportion a corresponding ratio of male and female enumerators will be used for this study. The team will be driven by the Senior Supervisor and Monitored by the Field Manager of South Zone. ○ Training - Core research team along with domain expert and south zone supervisor headed the Field staff training. Training would entail information on project background, introduction of partners, Objective of the Baseline assessment survey, Survey Protocols and Process, Quality of Data, Sampling method, Replacement strategy for drop-out/denials, selection of the right respondent, probing methods, and time frame. The identiﬁed ﬁeld investigators and supervisors will be trained on the ﬁnal tool. The teams will then be trained on administering the tool using CAPI. Two days in-house training with mock drills followed by a practical exposure to a sample village to get a better hold on the tools and data quality. Review and hand holding support will be carried out after practical exposure ○ Mock surveys - After the training is completed, mock surveys are conducted within the team. This identiﬁed the areas that need training and also provided handholding support to the FIs and FSs. This will also help enumerators get hands-on training of the CAPI application ○ Pilot - The core ﬁeld research team will be oriented on the project background, objectives, sample and pilot villages in discussion with local partners. CAPI orientation will be provided before moving for the pilot. Two researchers will go to a village as discussed and agreed with a local partner and conduct the pilot of 5 samples and prepare the feedback and experience. The pilot experiences and feedback on survey tools shared for further action. ● Post pilot changes feedback and changes incorporated in the design of the ﬁnal tool in SurveyCTO. The tool will be frozen for data collection. ● The ﬁeld work will be initiated after a few days onward in a sample location. First day data will be submitted to the Analyst and Quality controller to give feedback on data quality. Any discrepancies will be addressed before going for the next phase of data collection. Field work carried out to complete the sample as per sampling framework is shared. 5.2 During data collection ● Monitoring during data collection ○ FI wise target vs completion - In a time-bound survey of this nature, it is important to set targets for each of the ﬁeld investigator and supervisor and to ensure that these targets are being met regularly. The proposed CAPI will capture this and will show the progress at each level (FI, FS, Location). ○ Average time taken - Based on the results of the paper-based pilots and the pilots undertaken using the CAPI designed, average time to be taken for each section and 28 --- Page 30 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study the tool will be identiﬁed. Analytics will be available ﬁeld investigator wise which can be compared against the standard set. This will help identify investigators who need support. ○ Back check forms - Smaller forms can be designed on top of the existing tool as the back-check form. These forms will be synced to the original form through unique question labels and household ID. 5% of the respondents will be sampled randomly from each ﬁeld investigator. Back checks were done using these forms and through telephonic interviews. Data on the following will be collected: ■ Conﬁrmation of ﬁeld work carried out ■ Conﬁrmation of the time taken to conduct the interview ■ Response on key indicators ■ Feedback on the process of data collection ● Detailed documentation will be maintained of the quality checks done on the ﬁeld. The errors that arise on the ﬁeld can be categorised into the following: ○ Need for retraining on using and understanding the tool. ○ Need for retraining on using CAPI. ○ Need for retraining on asking and probing the questions in the most accurate and appropriate way. ● Ethical issues like fudging data etc. ○ Based on the severity of the error, either retraining and handholding support will be provided through ﬁeld supervisors. In case of ethical issues or misappropriation of data, the ﬁeld investigator will be terminated, and the data collected by him will be re-collected by replacement team members. ● Back check forms analysis - Data collected using the back-check forms will be analysed and available ﬁeld investigator wise to monitor the quality of data collection. ● Spot check - As ﬁeld investigators operate with a high degree of independence and ﬂexibility, random and unannounced spot check visits will be used to check on data collection activities. The following will be the key observation parameters: ● Methods of asking questions and probing ● Method of recording the responses in the CAPI being used ● Attitude of interacting with the members ● Spot checks or accompanying checks will be done by the supervisor per day to ensure the quality of data collection. A total of 5% of spot checks will be done. 5.3 Post data collection ● Download data - Data synced on the tablets will be available on the server and will be accessible to all the admin users. The data can be downloaded in a CSV or excel format. Back-up of the data will be taken as ofﬂine downloaded ﬁles every day to ensure that data is available for audit and analysis as and when needed. 29 --- Page 31 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study ● Check for outliers - The ﬁnal data downloaded will be tested for outliers, redundancies and inconsistencies. ● Check for crosstabs - Data will be tested for internal validity as well before submission. Cross tabulations will be done between variables across different sections and different questions to ensure that the data is valid as per the predeﬁned rules. ● Preliminary analysis - Downloaded data will be analysed weekly on the following parameters: ○ Using timestamp to look at the number of interviews per day against the reported data ○ % of no response and do not know in key questions ○ Average time taken between sections and for the entire tool ● Any discrepancies so found will be deleted from the original dataset. In order to ensure transparency, all the deleted records will also be shared as a separate ﬁle. SurveyCTO will be used for data collection. 6. Anticipated Risks and Mitigation plan The risks that are anticipated at this stage are mentioned below: ● A small proportion of the CAPI devices usually face technical issues (blanking of screen, keyboard issues, etc.) daily. For small errors, these devices will be rectiﬁed in the ﬁeld with the help from the supervisor personnel, who will provide instructions over the telephone using toll free numbers. In case a device is irreparable, the device will be replaced. ● CAPI based surveys are usually not conducted in areas affected by political unrest. There is always the risk of teams being kidnapped and the devices being retained or conﬁscated by local stakeholders. Careful planning will be undertaken along with the MagicBus Foundation team to protect the teams and the devices while survey is on-going in these areas. At CMS we have insurance coverage for full time employees. Networking consultants are having their own personal insurance plans and we are not responsible for that. However, if any unforeseen incidents happen during ﬁeld work, organisations support the network consultants/part-time employees. ● Drop-out of trained interviewers – especially due to illness – is always a risk. Extra enumerators will be recruited before training to replace in case of dropouts. The COVID19 situation may exacerbate the situation, but we will recruit additional interviewers for this. ● While the unlock 5 guidelines say that no restrictions apply on any economic activity, any change in government advisory might delay the timelines. Also travel within containment zones may not be possible. We have recruited local staff to avoid intra-state, intra-district travel but if any of the villages/respondents come in a containment zone, it could lead to delays and higher non-response could be anticipated. We will need additional replacement samples as a mitigating strategy. 30 --- Page 32 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 6.1 Support sought from MagicBus India Foundation MagicBus India Foundation Baseline assessment Data collection is a time bound study with 4 months as an outside limit. It is important that all preparatory activities happen in a planned manner. As the study involves physical surveys during the COVID-19 times, it is crucial that the inputs from BISLD, the implementing partner, should support us timely in order to meet the deadlines. The following support is expected: ● Sample details for students including address (GP, block and village details with exact address for each of the students. Accurate phone numbers for the sample. ● Supporting letter from MagicBus India Foundation for the CMS team for visiting the ﬁeld on behalf of MagicBus India Foundation and collecting data for the project. ● Introducing CMS to local partners. With the support of a local client, an introductory meet or call will be set up between the research agency (CMS) and the local implementing partner. This call will be facilitated by the programme team and it will help in building a good rapport with the respondent. The introductory call will provide background about the research agency (CMS); who we are (organisation and individual), purpose and objectives of the study; and what are the expectations from them. This also provides local context and exceptions to be kept in mind while visiting the ﬁeld. ● Ground Support team from the implementing team in the treatment villages for troubleshooting and introduction/rapport building with the program stakeholders. Supporting the ﬁeld team in identiﬁcation of control villages and program respondents as and when needed. ● Any other information and support that will be crucial to ﬁeld data collection and analysis. ● For the ﬁeld team to conduct data collection exercises in a timely fashion, the programme team in each district/block would need to be informed about the ﬁeld plan and support needed from them. ● Lastly, the study team would request for timely feedback on progress of work so that course correction can be implemented, and study objectives be achieved as intended. 31 --- Page 33 --- M agicBus Foundation-Haryana: Baseline Assessm ent study 7.

Life skills are deﬁned as &amp;quot;abilities for adaptive positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life&amp;quot; (WHO. 1993) 1 . Life skills, from this perspective are essentially those abilities which help to promote mental well-being and competence in young people as they face the realities of life. Life skills education revolves around instructing individuals in essential skills that are applicable to their everyday lives. Life skills, when taught as generic skills for life, are taught in the context of holistic health and social issues, such as relationships, learning about social inﬂuences on behaviour and learning about rights and responsibilities (WHO, 1996 2 ). This form of education encompasses the development and application of skills, particularly in addressing signiﬁcant health and social concerns. The educational approach involves actively engaging children and adolescents in a dynamic process of teaching and learning, frequently drawing upon the principles of social learning theory (Bandura, 1977). Life skills has been identiﬁed as an essential resource for developing psychosocial, emotional, cognitive, behavioural and resilience skills to negotiate every day challenges and productive involvement in the community (Desai, 2010 3 ). These skills play a vital role in helping young individuals effectively navigate and resolve the difﬁculties they encounter while striving to become active and valuable members of society. The purpose of life skills training is to facilitate the acquisition of skills that have a direct impact on health and behaviour within the social environment. Today&amp;#x27;s Indian adolescents have more information and cultural alternatives than before, but economic dependence on parents limits their ability to make choices. To succeed globally and become independent adults, they need to enhance their psychosocial competencies through life skills training. This training equips them with the necessary skills to navigate a competitive and rapidly changing world (Narasimha &amp;amp; Rao, 2011 4 ). India, with its vast population, faces numerous challenges in the education and skill development sector, particularly for adolescents. It has been observed that while nearly all children are enrolled in primary schools, the transition to higher education remains low, with only 33% progressing to Grade 11 and a mere 10% pursuing higher education. 4 Life skills education for young adolescents - Indian experience 3 A narrative systematic review of life skills education: effectiveness, research gaps and priorities.

Recognizing the critical need to address these challenges, the Magic Bus India Foundation (MBIF) has initiated the &amp;quot;Government Partnership Programme in Haryana.&amp;quot; This program aims to provide life skills education to adolescents from underserved backgrounds, empowering them with the necessary tools to navigate their journey from childhood to livelihood. By focusing on skill development and fostering a supportive environment, the program seeks to bridge the gap between required skills and available opportunities, ultimately enabling adolescents to make info rmed decisions about their futures. The Government Partnership Programme in Haryana is being implemented in collaboration with the Department of Education, Haryana, and Samagra Governance. It will be conducted in three districts: Gurugram, Panchkula, and Yamuna Nagar. The program targets an outreach of 80,009 adolescents and 1,358 teachers across 679 schools in the academic year 2023-24. The curriculum will be delivered to students in Classes 6 to 8 through a cohort-based approach, with a transition to higher grades in subsequent years. The program adopts an innovative teacher-led model, wherein teachers are trained to deliver life skills education sessions to students. Each academic year, students will receive 48 hours of activity-based experiential learning sessions, focusing on knowledge, skill, and attitude development. The sessions will be designed to encourage student participation, reﬂection, and behaviour change. Magic Bus School Support Ofﬁcers (SSOs) will be assigned to approximately 10-12 schools to provide training, mentoring, and monitoring support to teachers, ensuring the effective implementation of the program. 1.2 Our Understanding of the ToR The evaluation being proposed by the agency encompasses a comprehensive scope of work. It involves the development of an evaluation design and methodology to assess students from Grade 6th to 10th. These students will undergo a transformative educational experience, as they will be equipped with essential life skills (cognitive, social and emotional) consisting of 11 skills and 35 competencies that are crucial for thriving in the 21st century . These skills include effective communication, critical thinking and problem solving, collaborative teamwork, and self-awareness, among others. In collaboration with the Department of Education, Haryana, and Samagra Governance, Magic Bus India Foundation (MBIF) is implementing a Life Skills Education program for adolescents in Haryana. The program is made possible through the support of the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation (MSDF). The focus of the program is on empowering teachers to lead and deliver effective life skills education to adolescents in the region. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Inform key investment decisions CMS brings new knowledge to the academic community and to the school ecosystem stakeholders in terms of critical factors inﬂuencing key investment decisions and management decisions. In collaboration with the Government of Karnataka&amp;#x27;s Nali Kali project,-Activity Based Learning, spanning 11 districts and 60 clusters across the entire state. CMS undertook complex evaluation to examine the effects of educational interventions on children. The evaluation captures the prioritises of delivering quality education and the need for enhancement of life skills. This comprehensive evaluation generated meaningful evidence to inform about the progress, course corrections and future investments for the program. Building pathway for Evidence CMS team assessed the effectiveness of the DM project implemented by the Agastya International Foundation. The project aimed to provide economically disadvantaged children in remote schools of Madhya Pradesh with access to hands-on science education programs, fostering their creative thinking, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills. Our evaluation focused on measuring the change in students&amp;#x27; curiosity levels resulting from Agastya&amp;#x27;s intervention. We explored the signiﬁcant factors inﬂuencing curiosity, both promotive and inhibitory, to gain insights for scaling up initiatives and offering evidence-based recommendations for educational expansion and investment. CMS also collaborated with Pratham Books to undertake a project evaluation of their initiative called the &amp;quot;Book Coupon Programme.&amp;quot; This project aimed to provide storybooks to students in government and low-cost private schools, while also ensuring their access to books at a nominal cost of INR 2. CMS conducted the evaluation to examine the variations in behaviour and attitudes among the students, as well as to assess the life skills they acquired and utilised throughout the project. In addition to assessing the change in children’s behaviour, we also examined parent&amp;#x27;s outlook towards buying books . At every level of the evaluation process, our team strives to comprehend the community or beneﬁciaries we work with, aiming to provide valuable insights to our client for enhanced implementation in future endeavours.

The evaluation will include analysing the changes in key indicators, understanding the factors that contributed to the outcomes. Knowledge, Attitude, Practice, Sustainability, Impact and Scale- The Parents tool will be developed to assess Knowledge in terms of life skills gained and levels of awareness. Attitude in terms of perception of parents and students towards life skill education. Capturing change in the attitude and behaviour of an adolescent as observed by the parent. Towards this, the parent tool will also include the transition capturing features to show the students transition from school to school and comparative questions to capture the change in students’ behaviour The parent tool developed will be pilot tested to mitigate any social desirability bias. Looking at the sustainability of outcomes, knowledge or practice and impact in terms of the beneﬁts of the programme. Further, looking from the lens of scalability which could be both horizontal (example, in terms of number of students) or vertical (example, in terms of life skill sessions). In addition to the Parent tool, a mix of open ended &amp;amp; close ended questionnaires will be administered to 90 School Management Committee/Headmasters across each of the sample schools to holistically capture the inﬂuence of school environment on the students life skills and competencies. The tool will also capture overlap analysis with any other NGOs in the intervention area to account for any spillover amounting . The output of the tool will identify the enablers &amp;amp; barriers in the school ecosystem and their relation to students’ life skill development. In addition to the school ecosystem the inﬂuence of the village ecosystem on the students’ life skill development will be captured through a village level tool. The tool will be a semi-structured interview which will be administered to a total 24 Sarpanch/SMC members/Key Resource person at the village level. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

From each PSU, 20 parents are to be selected ( Priority should be given to the parents whose children are studying in the sample schools), resulting in a total of 1800 parents. Additionally, a questionnaire tool will be administered to School Management/HM of 90 schools (30 per district) to capture the inﬂuence of school environment on Students life skill &amp;amp; competencies. The schools will be randomly selected to capture various typologies of the school&amp;#x27;s ecosystem. The identiﬁcation criteria will account for School Infrastructure (playground, laboratories, tech integration etc) , Teacher Availability (teacher-student interactions), Location (rural/urban), Inclusion parameters (diversity, Gifted children etc) . To capture the inﬂuence of village ecosystem on the students life skill development, a village level tool will be administered to a sample of the 24 Sarpanch, Key resource persons at the village level Further Key Informant Interviews, In-depth Interviews and Focus group discussions will be conducted. 3 KIIs with District Education Ofﬁcers (1 in each district), 9 with school teachers (3 per district), 6 with Community Youth Leaders (2 per district). 6 FGDs will be conducted with students (2 per district), 6 with parents (2 per district) and 3 FGDs with CLFs (1 per district) resulting in a total of 33 qualitative interactions. These interactions will elicit outcomes and help in establishing the baseline values on key indicators of the programme. The detailed Sampling Framework is attached in Annexure 2 . 3.1.3 Data Analysis Plan The analysis framework shows the entire gamut of research methodology, quantitative and qualitative research tools and key ﬁndings across the assessment. Quantitative Analysis The quantitative data is split between a student survey and a parent survey and will be analysed using advanced statistical tools such as Stata. The quantitative parents assessment will be facilitated with qualiﬁed enumerators through a CAPI administered tool. All analysis will be carried out in stages. At ﬁrst, descriptive statistics such as mean, median, Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 15 --- Page 16 --- standard deviation, quartile or decile distribution will be done along with frequency tables as well as cross-tabulations. Then as a second step, causality would be established using econometric methods as relevant to the identiﬁcation methodology adopted for evaluations. This will provide impact estimates for the program. Qualitative Analysis The qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations will help to understand enabling pathways and barriers that can improve the implementation model and generate best practice and systemic process documents that can be taken as evidence for scaling up. Focus Group Discussion: Parents &amp;amp; Students group are the key stakeholders who have individual perspectives and roles which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. In-Depth interviews/Key Informant Interviews: In the proposal stage, identiﬁed a set of key stakeholders who have collective opinions which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the outcomes. For example, School teachers, Education department ofﬁcials’, community youth leaders and SMCs individual perspectives and attitudes determine the support and effectiveness of the interventions. Systems and documentation review: The role of ﬁdelity and process adherence would be reviewed against set SoPs, documents, reported and unreported information. They would be critical to understand knowledge built in the past and speciﬁc insights can be drawn upon. These qualitative interactions and ﬁeld observations would provide an insight into the practices seen on the ground vis-a-vis the responses seen in the assessment. Qualitative data can consist of interview notes, transcripts, participant observation ﬁeld notes etc. We will prepare thematic coding to identify patterns in data. The study will analyse the qualitative data collected through the KIIs using software such as Nvivo or Atlas.ti. Systems thinking and Journey mapping exercise. In addition to the quantitative and qualitative data analysis the Theory of Change envisioned in the program will be reviewed through the exercise of Systems thinking and Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

A critical review of the Theory of Change will allow us to identify the Causal Assumptions and Implementation assumptions . To understand the implementation assumptions, it is necessary to empathise with the student’s journey from primary to successful completion in Life skill development. This will be critical to capture key aspects that would challenge the program’s success and failure. 3.2 A timetable/implementation plan Based on the overall scope of work and for the planned evaluations, a work plan is developed. The study will be rolled out in six stages: Stage 1: Inception Meeting - In the inception meeting, CMS will discuss the planned evaluations with the Magic Bus team. Accordingly, CMS’s core team and expert/knowledge partners would conduct a comprehensive desk review of the project and other documents and develop the ﬁeld visit plan, overall study framework and methods. This stage will be completed within the ﬁrst week from the date of signing the contract. Stage 2: Detailed methodology, Inception report and Field visit plan – Planning discussions will be carried out with the Magic Bus team regarding logistics, resource availability and facilitation for the planned evaluations and ﬁeld visits. Based on these, an inception report would be submitted for the planned evaluations with the design of the respective evaluations/studies, their proposed methodology and sampling plans and a detailed plan on the sequence of activities (including list of interviews, focus group discussions, etc. and the ﬁeld visit plan). These will be in accordance with the scope of work and the prescribed timelines. Stage 3: Study instruments development – Two weeks will be utilised for the development of study instruments, questionnaire design and ﬁeld team induction and training. Once the tools have been designed, the ﬁnalisation of the framework and survey operations will be done with the Magic Bus team. CMS will furnish completed tools and make required modiﬁcations in two weeks for each planned evaluation. Stage 4: Survey Operation &amp;amp; Data collection- Quantitative &amp;amp; Qualitative data will be collected from the Sampling units as listed out in the sampling plan. In terms of data Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The student questionnaire tool will have a unique student ID which will also be mapped to the parent survey. OMR printing and scanning to be taken up by CMS. Stage 5: Analysis of quantitative &amp;amp; Qualitative data - Post the ﬁeld data collection a comprehensive process of data cleaning along with data preparation and warehousing would happen. During this phase, a dedicated data analysis team of experts will be involved and coordinating the data handling aspects from the CMS team. Analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team and discussions with the project team will take place. During this period, dedicated two consultations with the project team is expected. Post the data cleaning activity, data analysis will be front ended by the data analysis team in STATA according to the agreed speciﬁcations and outputs. Finalised data sets and codebook after quality veriﬁcation and responses to queries will be submitted as a deliverable during this stage. Based on preliminary analysis of quantitative data, a questionnaire for qualitative data collection will be developed. Post tool development, FGDs will be carried out to collect qualitative data. Stage 6: Presentation on Topline ﬁndings and datasets : We would furnish cleaned and coded primary data (including qualitative transcripts), tools, and any other material related to data collection and analysis with the Magic Bus team. Provide a presentation to the team on the high-level ﬁndings on completion of ﬁeld visits with analysis of the ﬁeld data, reﬂections with the internal team and discussions with the Magic Bus team as key observations. Stage 7: Analysis and reporting: A draft report for baseline evaluation will be presented to the Magic Bus team. District-wise bifurcation will be presented as part of draft and ﬁnal report. The Final report would be concise and will be structured around following sections: ● List of acronyms and abbreviations ● Table of contents ● Executive summary ● Introduction ● Methodology, implementation details, and limitations Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 19 --- Page 20 --- 3.4 Confidentiality and Ethical Considerations Ensuring anonymity and protecting respondent identity is a mandatory requirement, and our organisation adheres to stringent protocols for maintaining the highest level of conﬁdentiality. We have implemented robust measures to safeguard data security and privacy across our digital tools and platforms, including encryption of survey forms and clear guidelines for enumerators on data sharing, accompanied by conﬁdentiality contracts. Our enumerators undergo comprehensive training to remain unbiased and refrain from sharing any personal opinions, claims, or identifying information. They are bound by a conﬁdentiality agreement with CMS, committing to the proper use of conﬁdential information solely for the designated purposes outlined in their training, and not disclosing it to any third party. Additionally, our enumerators are instructed not to copy, retain, or share any written information that could potentially reveal identifying features of individuals, and all conﬁdential information, such as questionnaires, notes, photographs, and memoranda, is handed over to the team upon the conclusion of the surveys. 3.5 Quality Control Mechanism With over 200 projects and an in-house portfolio for data collection, CMS has strong expertise in ensuring quality data collection and follows strong protocols in the data collection process. This becomes especially relevant in the post pandemic scenario wherein the team has been following stringent guidelines around safety and hygiene, following international standards. After the questionnaire is ﬁnalised in consultation with MAGIC BUS FOUNDATION, researchers from the CMS team will conduct a pilot in the ﬁeld to ensure that the tool is well tailored to the location, project context as well as a cultural point of view. Once the post-pilot changes are completed, the tool is scripted and tested in-house (for skips and validations) by researchers and tested in a setting similar to that of the intended sample. Th e ﬁnal questionnaire is translated into local language by experienced thematic translators to retain the essence and yet contextualise for the local language. Translated Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 20 --- Page 21 --- tools undergo a proofreading exercise to check the consistency and accuracy of the translation by the research team who is well versed in local languages. Monitoring of data quality is the most important aspect of data collection. Poor quality data reduces the effectiveness of policy intervention, and can also require a repeat of the entire data collection process. Therefore, the research team sets clear guidelines and protocols for the monitoring and quality assurance that include maintaining a real-time MIS dashboard of collection, minimising non-response with 2-3 attempts, ensuring enumerator quality controls with spot checks, back checks (on major topics, time taken, etc.) and looping mechanisms. Data management is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect in the data collection process. The CMS team has robust processes, the quantitative data is stored online on secured servers synched in real-time that ensure data security. All hard copies of the research notes, qualitative interviews, etc. are scanned and MAGIC BUS FOUNDATION uploaded almost in real-time to avoid any loss of data. The research team has strong experience in working with multiple scripting software such as Survey CTO, Commcare, ODK, etc. and experience in online data management. Data cleaning is perhaps the most critical step between data collection and data analysis. CMS believes that it is a rigorous process, and that the quality of the analysis is correlated to the quality of data cleaning. Most of the data validation exercise is completed in real-time to avoid post-cleaning efforts including id variable checking, outlier tagging, missing values and replacements, illogical value assessment, addressing typos, survey codes, missing values and adding labels. Irregularities and corrections are identiﬁed and documented, but changes are made only after introspection with the ﬁeld team and the qualitative insights. 3.6 Selection of Interviewers/Enumerators and their Training CMS has an expert network of senior enumerators Pan India with strong domain knowledge and past experience of working on assessment of Education related impact assessment projects. They are also trained on research ethics and the collection of sensitive Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 21 --- Page 22 --- information, etc. The selection of enumerators is based on stringent measures, and they are assessed for quality throughout the project. A detailed training and orienting process is designed at multiple levels, including the training of trainers. Training is provided on all aspects of data collection including programme background, objectives and scope of the study, sampling techniques and replacement methodology, discussion on each question with probing methods, logistics planning and support. A scientiﬁc approach to the training process is ensured by creating standard training protocols, manuals including standardisation in survey techniques. Key personnel including members of the research and ﬁeld supervisory team are present to enable the highest quality of data collection. Mock surveys and ﬁeld days are planned for the team for in-ﬁeld experience with the software and survey tool. During the pandemic, CMS has worked on remote data collection methods and alternate hybrid models that are enabled by in-person local facilitation and best use of technology (short message service (SMS), online surveys (web), computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), and interactive voice response (IVR)). CMS is open to working on a hybrid approach to data collection in consultation with the MAGIC BUS FOUNDATION. 4 Organisation and Stafﬁng 4.1 Proﬁles of Key Project Personnel Amit Gupta (Advisor) Amit Gupta is the Co-founder &amp;amp; Non-Executive Director, Callidus Social Enterprises which is a Bangalore based CSR project lifecycle management consulting ﬁrm, working with NGOs in capacity building and developing a SaaS model marketplace for CSR project execution, monitoring and evaluation, impact assessment through improved transparency and accountability from multiple stakeholders.

    <Content>BACKGROUND &amp;amp; RATIONALE Impact of climate change is multifaceted and poses significant challenges across various sectors. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events contribute to adverse effects on agriculture, water resources, and public health. These countries witness heightened risks of heatwaves, floods, and droughts, leading to agricultural disruptions, food insecurity, and economic losses. Vulnerable populations, including indigenous communities and those in remote areas, are particularly susceptible to these impacts. Additionally, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, affecting public health. The variability in climate conditions further exacerbates challenges in healthcare delivery, including routine immunization, as extreme weather events disrupt infrastructure and create logistical hurdles. Recognizing the broader implications of climate change on these nations is crucial for developing adaptive strategies, resilient healthcare systems, and sustainable development practices to mitigate the far-reaching consequences on the environment, economy, and public health[1] In the Philippines, Cambodia, and India, primary health care (PHC) stands as a vital pillar for promoting holistic well-being, with a common reliance on community health workers to bridge gaps in healthcare access and build trust among diverse populations. While the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act in the Philippines underscores the importance of equitable access, these nations grapple with persistent barriers such as limited resources, financial constraints, and disparities in healthcare, further exacerbated by the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. [2] Each country addresses these issues through initiatives like free routine vaccinations and maternal health programs, recognizing the importance of preventive care. Cambodia faces population growth challenges, particularly in impoverished northeastern regions, with indigenous communities encountering hurdles related to education and early marriage [3]. Meanwhile, India contends with a dual obstacle of low awareness and operational difficulties in routine immunization, compounded by cultural beliefs and logistical constraints. Collectively, these nations emphasize the need for improved infrastructure, increased healthcare workforce engagement, and resilient health systems to navigate existing challenges and enhance the effectiveness of routine health programs.[4] Climate change poses significant challenges to the healthcare systems of the Philippines, Cambodia, and India, with distinct impacts on each country. In the Philippines, a country susceptible to typhoons and extreme weather events, the changing climate can lead to disruptions in healthcare infrastructure, affecting the delivery of essential health services. The vulnerability of the Philippines to natural disasters, exacerbated by the effects of climate change, may result in challenges in providing timely and consistent healthcare, especially in the wake of frequent typhoons and floods.[5] Similarly, Cambodia, facing potential changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures, may experience disruptions in agricultural practices, affecting the livelihoods of communities. The Plateau and Mountains region, with its indigenous populations, may be particularly vulnerable, facing socio-economic challenges aggravated by the impacts of climate change on agricultural activities.[6] In India, a country with diverse climate patterns, extreme weather events such as heatwaves and floods can hinder routine immunization programs, especially in remote and underserved areas. The increased health risks, coupled with existing operational challenges in the healthcare sector, create a complex scenario where climate change compounds the difficulties in delivering essential health services . Addressing these challenges requires not only strengthening healthcare infrastructure and accessibility but also implementing adaptive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on the health and well-being of these nations.[7] The study is of paramount importance as it delves into the intricate interplay between climate change impacts and vaccine equity in these regions. The information gathered from the three countries underscores the vulnerabilities of health systems, particularly in the face of environmental crises, emphasizing the need for resilience and adaptability. By shedding light on challenges related to healthcare accessibility, infrastructure inadequacies, and cultural dynamics influencing vaccine acceptance, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted barriers faced by these nations. Additionally, the identification of operational challenges during environmental crises and the proposed policy implications and adaptation strategies offer valuable insights for strengthening health systems and ensuring equitable vaccine distribution. As climate change increasingly affects global health, this study contributes vital data from diverse South-East Asian contexts, making it a significant and timely endeavor with implications for international efforts to address the intersection of climate change and healthcare equity. RESEARCH QUESTION How do climatic events such as floods, droughts, heat waves, cold waves, etc., and climate change affect the supply and access of vaccines for vulnerable communities in specific regions in each of the three southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, India, and the Philippines? OBJECTIVE Mapping climate vulnerabilities: Understanding vulnerabilities to climatic events and the possibility of health system disruption due to these events through a comprehensive analysis of climatic data, extreme weather events, and environmental indicators in the following regions : Cambodia: Five provinces in the northeast region: Mondul Kiri, Ratanak Kiri, Stung Treng, Preah Vihear and Siem Reap provinces India: Two states - Assam and Chattisgarh State: Assam - District: Darrang / Blocks: Jaljali, Kharupetia (1 District, 2 Blocks) State: Chattisgarh - District: Raipur / Blocks Arang, Dharsiwa ; District: Kanker / Blocks: Kanker, Naraharpur (2 Districts, 4 Blocks) Philippines: Three local government units (LGUs)– Tabaco City in Albay Province, Baguio City in Cordillera Administrative Region, and Bagong Silangan (Barangay/Village) in Quezon City. Analyzing vaccine distribution: Analyse national/state policies and vaccine infrastructure (such as production, storage, and supply) to understand the current state of vaccine distribution and barriers that can be worsened due to climatic events Impact on vulnerable communities: Understand how climatic events affect these regions, especially the vulnerable communities. Also, understand their perspectives and views about vaccination and the health system. Impact on health infrastructure: Understand how climatic events affect the health institutions in regions of each of these countries, their current mitigation strategies, and challenges. METHOD Study setting The study will be conducted in three Southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. In Cambodia, the focus is on five provinces in the northeast region—Mondul Kiri, Ratanak Kiri, Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. In India, the focus is on Assam and Chattisgarh, specifically Darrang district in Assam, and Raipur and Kanker districts in Chattisgarh, along with their respective blocks. In the Philippines, the study is focussed on three distinct local government units—Tabaco City in Albay Province, Baguio City in Cordillera Administrative Region, and Bagong Silangan in Quezon City. The study setting encompasses a diverse range of climatic zones, including areas prone to floods, droughts, and heatwaves, to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the impact of various climatic events on vaccine equity. Sample selection The sample includes individuals residing in vulnerable communities within the selected regions of Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. Purposive sampling is employed to select the samples.In the quantitative phase,questionnaires will be administered to the sample.Other datasets such as vaccination coverage data etc is also leveraged. In the qualitative phase key informants, including healthcare professionals, policymakers,and community members are interviewed to ensure diverse perspectives and experiences are captured. Sample size calculation: For quantitative data collection, the sample size is calculated using the Slovin’s formula: n=N/(1+Ne^2) Where, N-Population size e-margin of error(5%) In this study, For India, N=902042 Substituting the values, n=400. For Cambodia, N=1194678 n=400 For Philippines, Data Collection and Tools The study would involve a cross-sectional exploratory mixed-method approach. The qualitative aspect of the study seeks to capture the nuanced experiences, perceptions, and challenges faced by key stakeholders in the realm of vaccine delivery to the vulnerable communities. Through the quantitative approach, we will leverage existing datasets on climate patterns, vaccine coverage, and health outcomes. Sampling strategies will be designed to represent diverse populations, with a focus on vulnerable communities.

Gain insights into socio-cultural dynamics influencing vaccine acceptance or hesitancy, personal experiences, decision-making processes, and concerns regarding vaccination. Participant Observation: Conduct participant observation within communities. Understand daily practices, community dynamics, and interactions related to vaccination. Observe individual interactions during healthcare visits, vaccination campaigns, and community meetings to capture non-verbal cues and contextual factors influencing vaccination decision Quantitative data collection Surveys and questionnaires: Conduct surveys among community members to gather data on awareness, and factors influencing vaccine acceptance. Simultaneously, employ semi-structured questionnaires for parents, caregivers, and individuals at the individual level to collect quantitative information on demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to vaccination. Vaccination Coverage data: Obtain official vaccination coverage data from health authorities to assess the overall immunization status at the community level. At the individual level, use individual-level vaccination records to quantify coverage and adherence to the recommended vaccination schedule among children and adults. Health Records: Collect aggregated health records from healthcare facilities to assess trends in vaccine-preventable diseases at the community level. On an individual level, review individual health records to track the vaccination history, identify missed doses, and assess adherence to vaccination schedules. Spatial data: Employ spatial data to assess the accessibility of vaccination services, considering travel distances and healthcare facility locations, both at the community and individual levels Data analysis For the qualitative data collected, transcription and translation will be done followed by thematic analysis to identify recurrent themes and patterns using Dedoose software. For the quantitative data statistical analyses, including correlation assessments, regression models, and spatial analyses, will be employed to identify patterns of vaccine distribution. RISKS Misinterpretation of cultural nuances may affect the validity of qualitative findings. Language differences may lead to miscommunication during interviews and surveys. Biased sampling in communities may influence the generalizability of results. Respondents may provide socially desirable responses, impacting the accuracy of survey data. Limited resources may affect the depth and breadth of the study, particularly in remote areas. LIMITATIONS Achieving a comprehensive understanding of diverse cultural perspectives may be challenging. Translation accuracy may impact the reliability of collected data. Difficulties in obtaining standardized health records across diverse healthcare settings. Differentiating genuine concerns from societal influences may be challenging. IMPLICATION OF THE EXPECTED FINDINGS The predicted study findings have important implications for the program&amp;#x27;s response to the connection of climate change and vaccination inequities within vulnerable populations. Understanding the deep complexities of this interaction will allow the program to improve the value of its existing interventions with the recommendations. If necessary, the findings may prompt the program to modify its scope of activities, addressing the severe detrimental impact of climate change on the health-related quality of life of vulnerable groups. Implementing the study&amp;#x27;s recommended strategies will not only result in more efficient and successful programs, but will also allow for mid-course modifications in the overall approach.

    <Content>Strategic Health Intervention Proposal In partnership with [Funding Partner], we propose a strategic intervention to improve health outcomes for vulnerable communities by tackling the critical challenges of hypertension and diabetes, advancing progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The Health and Poverty Gridlock: Hard Facts - Diabetes and Hypertension are deadly threats: With a population of over 1.4 billion, the target region is facing a severe health crisis where millions of people are impoverished annually due to out-of-pocket health expenditures. The intersection of health and poverty, coupled with poor access to primary healthcare, inadequate health systems, lack of capacities including underutilized technology, remains a critical challenge. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of deaths, with diabetes affecting over 100 million people. The region has become a diabetes hub, with millions currently affected and many more in a pre-diabetic state. It is alarming that a sharp rise is projected in diabetes cases, with many remaining undiagnosed. Concurrently, hypertension poses a significant public health crisis, affecting approximately 31% of the population. Despite its severe consequences, including stroke and heart failure, only 37% of those with hypertension are diagnosed, 30% get treated, and 15% of those diagnosed have their condition under control. This amplifies cardiovascular disease deaths. Research reveals millions of lives can be saved by [Target Year] with better control. At the same time, health is a low or no priority for low-income and marginalized communities. They often face health inequalities as health care is inaccessible, inconvenient, and expensive. Vulnerable populations don&amp;#x27;t want to navigate various places to access healthcare. They lose daily wages waiting for healthcare and additionally must cover travel costs, hospital fees, medicines, and other miscellaneous expenditures. Recent studies show the loss in wages due to illness among the poorest households is roughly 15% of the total household spending, nearly three times greater than their medical spending. These challenges are compounded by acute illnesses, chronic diseases, and social determinants that impact health. As a result, communities seek healthcare only when they are seriously unwell or faced with catastrophic illness, leading to increased preventable morbidity and mortality rates. Though the public healthcare system has made significant progress, it remains inadequate and unable to meet the needs of low-income and vulnerable populations. Therefore, it is imperative to implement targeted health interventions that are comprehensive, and above all, accessible and sustainable for vulnerable communities, ensuring timely prevention, diagnosis, and improvements in health and well-being. Investment for Wellness - A Unique Solution Our health initiative is a healthcare platform that adds first-mile elements and leverages existing healthcare providers. Working with community aggregators like women empowerment programs, we add a healthcare layer aimed at preventing illness and promoting wellness. Prompt quality primary care, proactive diagnosis of high-burden conditions, and navigation through specialist care where required eventually reduces disease burden and healthcare costs. Our implementing organization, a global public health agency, has incubated and tested this program across multiple community settings - urban, rural poor communities, marginalized communities, and factory workers in multiple countries. This comprehensive approach contributes to our goal of adding millions of healthy days to vulnerable communities. The Unique Selling Proposition Our approach is innovative, cost-effective, and adaptable because: Integrated - delivers tailored healthcare interventions that ensure comprehensive, continuous care, empowering individuals and communities for lasting health improvements. People are leaders and change agents, not just beneficiaries of service - local organizations of vulnerable groups create demand and deliver a range of services. Partnerships - collaboration with private and government service providers (healthcare and others) - are a core strategy. Cost-effective - optimized use of people, technology, and community involvement for significant and sustainable healthcare savings for people and providers. Technology enabled - different technology tools are embedded to enable care and service delivery for cohorts of people. Sustained outcomes: long-term impact by empowering communities, fostering leadership, and ensuring lasting improvements in health outcomes. Unlocks social capital - enhances efficiency by aligning with government initiatives, creating a coordinated healthcare network that maximizes resources and expertise. Scalable - the digital platform and core replicated across diverse communities, ensuring broader impact and reach. Between [Start Year]-[End Year], the program has served hundreds of thousands of people and numerous instances of screening and treatment support on high-burden conditions including anemia, vision issues, diabetes, hypertension, and STIs. There have also been cumulative savings of millions of dollars by individuals as an investment in their own well-being. The model has added millions of healthy days to the lives of vulnerable populations. The Implementation We use the following strategies to deliver better outcomes: Early detection: Frontline teams conduct risk assessment, screening, and testing for hypertension and Type 2 diabetes, by mobilizing group activities, which includes health literacy and both pre and post-test counseling. Treatment: Identified individuals receive treatment via local public health systems, with follow-up care supported through a tele-care platform, to ensure continuum of care. Tele-care services are provided in local languages to meet the specific needs of the community and can be accessed by anyone in the community for support on health, social protection, and emotional health. Health education: Capacitated frontline community health workers conduct health education on hypertension and diabetes focuses on understanding risk factors, symptoms, and lifestyle changes to manage and prevent these conditions. It includes promoting a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, medication, and the importance of regular health check-ups to detect and control hypertension and diabetes early. Health products (insurance, nutritious food etc): Access to government health insurance is enabled by community health workers. The frontline teams also promote essential health products, such as nutritional supplements, to help communities maintain better health. Collaboration Framework This initiative will be spearheaded by a health collaboration, a multi-stakeholder effort that harnesses domain expertise to implement people-centered primary health care initiatives. The partners involved are: Through partnerships, financial inclusion is enabled including assisting families in opening bank accounts, promoting savings, and providing access to credit to meet their financial needs. Targeted Communities and Reach Communities from low socio-economic backgrounds, including urban and rural areas, informal migrant workers, and other marginalized groups are reached, targeting approximately [X] people. Proposed Implementation Locations We are able to implement in multiple locations across the target region, leveraging the presence of partners on the ground. We can expand across the entire region as needed. Program Duration We propose a minimum program duration of two years, but we encourage donors to invest in a long-term commitment to achieve greater impact and scalability. Expected Results and Outcomes The proposed program will contribute to increasing healthy days among targeted vulnerable communities through people-centered comprehensive primary health care. In particular, our impact will center around early detection of and reduction in morbidity and mortality due to non-communicable diseases such as Diabetes and Hypertension and improved quality of care for the same. While it is difficult to measure this impact in short-term programs, we will measure our progress by a few critical intermediate outcomes that are known to be good predictors of the impact we aim to achieve. We outline some of these below. Proposing the following output indicators: Number of individuals at risk screened for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Number of individuals diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes actively enrolled in care. Number of enrolled patients receiving regular follow-up. Number of individuals receiving education on hypertension and diabetes prevention and management. Number of individuals who have accessed health insurance. Number of community health workers trained on providing comprehensive primary healthcare services for communities. We will implement a robust Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) system, incorporating regular reviews for proactive issue resolution and fostering knowledge sharing to enable evidence-based practices. Progress against KPIs will be tracked through technology-enabled field teams and program managers, utilizing real-time applications. This system allows for timely data capture, monitoring, analysis, and reporting. Costing Proposition: The proposed cost is $[X] per person for a one-year period, with a minimum commitment of reaching [X] people in line with the proposed program design. However, we have the capacity to reach up to one million people annually, and the per-person cost will decrease proportionately as the program scales. This cost includes program personnel, health screening, teleconsultation, insurance facilitation, health education, technology, and community mobilization. We will enable ultra-poor families to access medicines through local government health centers and facilitate access to subsidized medicines for those above the poverty line through collaborative partners.

Different types of investors ﬁt into the requirements of The Council 63 3 --- Page 5 --- 4 Executive Summary The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (The Council) is one of Asia’s leading not-for-proﬁt policy research institutions. The Council has emerged as a leading sectoral think tank in data, integrated analysis, and strategic outreach to mitigate, adapt and accelerate climate action and the use of natural resources. The founding board envisions The Council as an India-based, globally engaged policy research organisation. The think tank would analyse and advise on critical questions on energy, environment, and water as inter-connected concerns. The Council was set up in 2010 to serve as a platform for people with different skills to come together, pursue their interests and build careers in public policy. 4.1 The Council’s Vision 2030 Having completed a decade of their existence as a new-age public policy think tank, the study endeavours to reﬂect on the achievements of the past decade from the perspective of the existing donors. The study takes a deep dive into the areas where The Council has worked effectively, developing and analysing the resources, capabilities and competencies developed so far is essential to streamline the direction forward. The factors enabling growth are highly relevant to the changing dynamics of a world being threatened by climate-induced extreme events and anthropogenic environmental degradation with second-order consequences. The achievement of SDG 13 (combat climate change and its impacts) is inextricably linked to other SDGs, i.e., ● SDG 6 (access to water and sanitation for all), ● SDG 7 (access to affordable, dependable, sustainable, and modern energy), ● SDG 11 (Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable), ● SDG 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns) and ● SDG 15 (Sustainably manage forests, combat desertiﬁcation, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss), The domains that The Council is currently working on, aspire to intensify in the next decade and beyond. 4.2 Incorporating key stakeholder perspectives The Council has partnered with CMS (Catalyst Management Services Private Limited) to conduct a study which aims to assess and explore how The Council was perceived by its donors and potential donors in the sector. This study is one of the inputs towards The Council’s Vision 2030 exercise, understanding and aligning their core values, mission and vision, redesigning growth strategy in the light of a dynamic changing external environment. A reassessment of the strategic resources, capabilities and competencies suggested through the perception of donors needs to be developed to meet the changing needs of working on 4 --- Page 6 --- increasingly interdisciplinary, nexus areas cutting across energy, environment, and other natural resources. This study looks at the perception of donors across six levers, i.e., growth, impact, risks, demand, visibility, and value proposition. The approach used in this study was qualitative; the critical informant interviews consisted of donors across the old, new, and retained categories. This group is referred to as “Cohort 1” subsequently in the report. The Vision 2030 for The Council is spearheaded by the aspirations to Becoming a world-class institution in data, outreach, and analysis of global signiﬁcance with a focus on impact at scale, Moving sustainability from the “Margin” to “Mainstream” by working across the themes of policy, technology, ﬁnance, and behaviour to transition from an evidence-centric policy advisory body to actioning research, enable implementation at scale etc. The critical role played by the donor and the funding ecosystem to support this transition requires maturity of the engagement from transactional to transformational reality, betting on the institutional capacities of The Council and investing in the same. With the impending risks of the new Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) laws, it is paramount that The Council diversiﬁes the portfolio of funding to funders and mechanisms that allow, Investing in the institutional development of The Council and building the institutional capacities of the organisation. Investing in integrated ideas and not restricting their funds to a speciﬁc sector/domain, making big bets to achieve transformation across the larger ecosystem and Supporting the linkages of markets within and outside the country. The second part of the study covers the landscape of potential donors incorporating the new dimensions for expansion. In the report, we refer to this group as “ Cohort 2 ”. The possibilities of aligning with the new priorities and, if required, developing new strategies, structures, systems, and processes to assist The Council in laying out its roadmap and blueprint for the next decade and beyond allowed the study to shortlist a probable set of institutions and donors. The opportunities arising post the Paris Agreement and India’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are further encapsulated as “Panchamrit” for 2030 targets. They were shaping to be the fundamental tailwinds for new-age philanthropists, donors, corporations, and foundations to view the domains of climate change and its impact with modest funding mechanisms to help The Council transition into an ecosystem-level inﬂuencer. 4.3 Framework for the analysis As mentioned above, the sample consisted of new, old, and retained donors. These interviews allowed the CMS to track individual views on these broad eight categories. 5 --- Page 7 --- 1. Networks and Collaborations (Social Capital) 2.

Summary of ﬁndings across the 8 analytical levers ● Human capital and research capabilities ○ Charismatic and entrepreneurial leadership perception was the hallmark across the spectrum of donors, which has opened opportunities to international donors and funding agencies. ○ Donors expect to see a capacitated second line of business, entrepreneurial leaders and institutionalised processes developed to broad base engagement across the levels of the organisation, not restricted to the senior leadership only (50% of the donors) . ○ Overall, both from a thematic and functional point of view, human capital and research capabilities were perceived as being of superior quality. 6 --- Page 8 --- ● Recognition as a refreshing think tank ○ The Council is undoubtedly seen to be a very young, aggressive, pathﬁnder kind of organisation which provides a suitable platform with a lot of scope for growth opportunities to well-qualiﬁed personnel (40% of the donors) . ○ Though The Council scores high on reputation, integrity, and ﬁnancial transparency, the core value of “Integrated” is not yet embedded in the consciousness of most of the donors As such, the core, untied grants, instead of direct programmatic grants still seem to be an area that needs to be strengthened. There is potential for both approaches - Accelerating towards being a global think tank leveraging the social capital and human capital generated over the decade; and strengthening the local &amp;amp; sub-national partnerships, initiatives, and funding to becoming a pioneer within India (40% of the donors). ● Sector-leading social capital - High-quality networking, convenings and collaboration with national governments ○ Networking, convenings and collaborations with policymakers in the Central Government are superior strengths that donor agencies perceive (100% of the donors) in The Council, which has spearheaded changes and policies at the national level. ○ A similar quality of networking and collaborations needs to be developed at the sub-national level to leverage opportunities and emerge as a pioneering local think tank (40% of the donors) . ○ The perceived proximity of the leadership to the government stakeholder, however, did raise questions about “independence” being the core value (25% of the donors) . Improving the cohesion of collaborating with the peer institutions and competitive think tanks (4 donors) was indicated as an opportunity to attract collaborative-driven funding and leverage funding for complex and intersectional issues where the risks of failure or inaction are distributed across the collaborating partners ● High quality outputs, data visualisations and knowledge products ○ The quality and quantity of research outputs in the format of papers, articles, and citations across markets and sectors were appreciated and cited by donors in terms of deep/broad issues and impact (80% of the donors) . ○ The seminars, conferences and the convening capacity of The Council were perceived as outstanding. The relevance and engagement of stakeholders in each convening were practical. However, a general sentiment has been that The Council claims attribution beyond its proportionate share when it comes to policy announcements by the Government, which dilutes the “independent” stand espoused in its core values (3 donors). ● Network and Collaboration ○ Engagement and communication strategy with programmatic funding donors have been well received by most donors. 7 --- Page 9 --- ○ The Council was perceived as one of the top think tanks to engage with and an autoﬁt/ﬁrst choice for donors who have a criterion for selection of grantees/partners. ○ However, all donors have expressed a “felt need” for an effective communication strategy (4 donors) . Having concurrent communication beyond the realms of the engaging programme, engaging the communication team from the beginning, etc., is becoming necessary . A concerted effort in this direction, especially using various media and diverse communication channels, including social media, digital engagements, etc., would help the donors stay adept with the diversity of work by The Council. Donors also perceived that effective communication and awareness assist them with the need for more interdisciplinary and nexus areas of thought leadership being initiated by The Council. ● Technology and innovation ○ The donors did not have a lot of thoughts on The Council being at the forefront of technology and innovation. More efforts are required in communication and advocacy on the work the Council has undertaken. The second part of the study aimed to explore the landscape of climate and sustainability-related ﬁnancing in India, details of which are provided in the report from secondary data collection. The primary research involved discussions with a limited number of Indian philanthropists, High Net-worth Individuals (HNIs), impact investors, and the socially responsible investing community threw up alternatives for The Council to evaluate. ● The new age philanthropists are a set of progressive funding organisations with a ﬂexible outlook on their funding approaches. They are more focused on moving the needle in the sector which involves funding the nexus of sectors. They are more open to institutional funding as well, which involves patient capital. o Another key aspect of this group is the “laissez-faire” approach to funding where there are limited restrictions on the funds being deployed. However, they do follow a very free ﬂowing approach when it comes to deciding on the areas they fund. o They largely fund issues that are closer to their heart. From the type of investments, approach to the same, and expectations this group aligns very well with the perspective of The Council’s onward-looking journey. ● The impact investor group aligns broadly with the vision of The Council in terms of the larger impact that they hope to create. This group predominantly makes equity-based investments, but they are inclusive of the non-proﬁt organisation with successful social models engaged through a grant. o This subset of donors adopts a structured framework and approach when it comes to deploying their funds with clearly deﬁned focus areas which are decided based on the larger strategies of the portfolio. 8 --- Page 10 --- o Approaching this subset of donors would require The Council to strengthen its systems and processes as the reporting requirements are high for this group of investors. The investments focus on speciﬁc, measurable outcomes. o In case of not-for-proﬁt organisations, the impact is deﬁned across social and economic divisions with clear-cut deﬁnitions. While this group of investors align broadly with the direction in which The Council wants to go, few pivots must be made to tap into these funds. ● The ﬁnal groups that emerged are the private equity and debt-based investors. There is limited funding in this space that looks at the nexus of sectors. o Investments in the group are equity-based with few companies offering debt in the form of quasi-equity. The key focus for this group is the return on ﬁnancial investments and the sustainability of cash ﬂows. o Investments are clearly expected to generate returns from a ﬁnancial point; slightly lower than the industry average, but the ﬁnancial return is non-negotiable. In most cases, social returns are not measured post the investment and are only a criterion for making the investment. o For The Council, at this stage of their journey, this subset does not align with the set expectations. The Council might have to make signiﬁcant governance mechanisms and changes from the current structure such as setting up a for proﬁt arm to tap into these funds. ● Three clear proﬁles of funders emerged from the second part of the study, for The Council, there is clear alignment to the ﬁrst two groups and The Council is very well positioned to tap into these funds. 9 --- Page 11 --- 5 Introduction The Council on Energy, Environment and Water is one of Asia’s leading not-for-proﬁt policy research institutions. It uses data, integrated analysis, and strategic outreach to explain – and change – the use, reuse, and misuse of resources. Over 90% of The Council’s funding is generated from third-party grants, dependent upon agreed project deliverables and policy changes and the perceptions of these key stakeholders are central to chalking new opportunities and aspirations. The Council commissioned Catalyst Management Services Private Ltd. (CMS) to conduct a survey amongst the donor community to understand The Council’s growth, impact, risks, and vision for the future from the donor’s perspective and provide inputs toward formulating its Vision 2030. This is the report of the donor perception study. The introduction lays the foundation of the study by giving an overview of The Council, its work, signiﬁcant achievements and the status of its performance metrics; critical handles that the study used to develop the tools and discussions with the donors. The report then details the study methodology, including sampling and study tools. The following sections present the ﬁndings while capturing some detailed perceptions by select donors wherever applicable. 5.1 Overview of The Council The Council completed 10 years of existence in 2020. The organisation has evolved into a world-class organisation, putting people at the centre of world-class research. The journey of The Council ranges from the inputs to the 12th Five Year plan in 2011 to a study on the macroeconomic cost of inaction on water efﬁciency in 2020. Currently, with over a decade of experience, The Council has eight areas of focus which are ● Energy Access ● Renewables ● Power Sector ● Industrial Sustainability &amp;amp; Competitiveness ● Low-Carbon Pathways ● Risks and Adaptation ● Technology, Finance and Trade ● The Council Centre for Energy Finance Key achievements of the decade 1 ● In the domain of energy access, extensive primary data and engagement with the government led to the development of the Saubhagya scheme to achieve universal household electriﬁcation, impacting 12.5 crore lives. 1 https://www.ceew.in/impacts/celebrating-10-years-being-ceew 10 --- Page 12 --- ● The Council has been futuristic in its outlook with its analysis of the Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce, which contributed to setting the target of 175 GW of renewables by 2022. ● The Council has been transforming markets for good with the establishment of The Council Centre for Energy Finance in 2019; the USD 0.3 crores Powering Livelihoods initiative, a power sector project in Uttar Pradesh impacting 0.72 crore consumers, is an example of the same. ● The Council has been pivotal in envisioning Mission 80-80-80. The mission aims to reduce air pollution by 80 per cent in 80 cities by 2027 when India will turn 80 as an independent nation. ● Low-carbon pathways have been a focus of The Council in recent years; through complex modelling of over 200+ scenarios, The Council managed to create the largest database on India&amp;#x27;s industrial GHG emissions. They have contributed to drafting the National Hydrogen Mission as a foundation of low-carbon industrialisation. ● The Council has been instrumental in building trust between governments, thereby ensuring that the climate change agenda is also advanced globally. Key performance indicators, impact metrics, and gender KPIs 2 The Council has adopted KPIs and impact metrics, derived from its strategy and sectoral benchmarks to assess performance as a think tank. The KPIs are focused on criteria like reports published, media coverage, engagement with governments, gender structure, etc. These measurable values demonstrate how effectively The Council achieves its key objective and captures the essence of its overall success. These indicators and metrics can add substantial value to The Council by collectively framing issues of importance, providing deep insights into the effectiveness of engagement, quality of outputs, sectoral impact, and operational efﬁciencies, in addition to identifying opportunities for learning and improvement. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) The Council’s 19 KPIs are spread across the functions of research, government, industry and networks. The Council benchmarked the KPIs with the widely used Think Tank evaluation index. These KPIs and metrics have been used to identify the key indicators for the donor perception study. The numbers reﬂect 2020-21 data and those in brackets depict the data for 2019-2020 Research 1. Complete research projects and publications a.

Impact metrics The impact metrics of The Council capture the quality of their work and reﬂect on the achievements beyond research that have produced outcomes (real impact). These impact metrics emphasise that The Council is focusing intently on improving people’s lives, inﬂuencing policy, and transferring knowledge via research towards the policy sector. Some examples of The Council’s impact emerging from its ten-year journey are 3 : ● Research and engagement with the government have resulted in the development of the Saubhagya scheme, impacting 12.5 crore lives. 3 https://www.ceew.in/impacts/celebrating-10-years-being-ceew 12 --- Page 14 --- ● Extensive improvement of the Ujjwala scheme for cooking energy fuel has indirectly impacted 400 million lives. There has been a saving of INR 2400 crore annually through engagement with the direct beneﬁt transfer scheme and the give-it-up campaigns. ● Conceptualising and creating the Clean Energy Access Network has impacted 200 enterprises and unlocked at least INR 22.5 Crores in value. ● Research for the Prime Minister’s Ofﬁce and support to draft the cabinet note has resulted in setting the target of 175 GW of renewables by 2022, potentially creating a workforce of 330,000 people. ● Various state-level recommendations accepted by the UP-electricity regulator have led to billing and collection efﬁciency improvements that will impact .72 crores of domestic consumers. ● Direct contribution to the Delhi Net Metering Guidelines through the rooftop solar work, and indirect contribution to the central government’s Grid-Connected Solar Rooftop Programme (potentially creating 50,000 new jobs), resulted in the uptake of similar policies in Karnataka and other states. ● Involved in drafting the National Hydrogen Mission within industrial sustainability, adopted at the national level ● Estimating the energy and emissions from the industrial sector (the most signiﬁcant database) resulted in a peer review of India&amp;#x27;s ofﬁcial GHG inventory and contributed to the Biennial Update Reports with robust estimates for 63.5 crore tonnes of emissions from the industrial sector (~27 per cent of national emissions). ● Phasing down HFCs could avoid 3.86 gigatonnes of CO 2 -equivalent (GtCO 2 e) emissions in India by 2050, which could potentially contribute to reducing up to 0.4°C of global warming by the end of the century. ● Research on low-carbon pathways informed India&amp;#x27;s Mid-Century Strategy under the Paris Agreement. Gender KPIs Gender KPIs have been incorporated into The Council’s overall KPIs to reﬂect the gender diversity within the institution. The KPIs enabled The Council to analyse and monitor gender and diversity, which is considered an essential step toward making real, demonstrable change. The measurement metrics of The Council Gender KPIs centre around proportion, advancement, publication, and representation of women at all levels—alongside salary disbursement. Table 1.

Understanding Impact: Mapping The Council&amp;#x27;s research, advisory and outreach — and its consequent impact (from outputs to outcomes) with exciting visuals and testimonials. 2. Understanding Growth : Analysing perceptions around The Council’s growth being organic, planned, or strategic areas where it has surpassed expectations, and where its potential is yet to be fully realised. 3. Understanding Visibility : Analysing The Council’s approach towards data and strategic outreach, its commitment to transparency and its position in the public mindset. 4. Understanding Risks : Analysing how donors perceive The Council’s governance as well as the risks that The Council must be resilient against, whether emanating from internal processes, external environment, or strategic directions. 5. Understanding Demand : Assessing what donors want and ﬁnding points of cooperation between the two approaches without compromising The Council’s well-earned independence. 6. Understanding the value-proposition : Assessing perceptions of The Council’s values and priorities, including being integrated into analysis, international/global in outlook, independent of funders and clients, and its commitment to building careers in public policy. 7. Benchmarking: Benchmarking The Council against domestic and international competition. However, upon various discussions with the leadership team and the project engagement team, the scope of the study was limited to capturing the perception of the donors in Cohort 1 &amp;amp; Cohort 2 using the lenses mentioned above. 6.2 Donor perception framework The study framework was designed to effectively encompass the primary evaluation criteria presented by The Council as a part of the study TOR. The framework brings together a dipstick secondary landscaping exercise to enhance the understanding of sectoral perception, 14 --- Page 16 --- positioning, and aspects of institutional benchmarking in terms of engagement, processes, impact, and sustainability. The aspects of donor perception of The Council and insights were interjected from the primary interactions (Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with donors) with the donor communities (Cohorts 1 &amp;amp; 2). The guiding principles used for the study framework incorporated inputs from the Engagement Sustainability Index, USAID to measure the growth and development of policy research and implementation institutions. The framework also adopted inputs from the Think Tank Business Model , which is adopted by think tanks across the globe to measure the extent of value delivered to stakeholders, enticing funders to pay for value and convert payments to research with the potential to inﬂuence policy. The ﬁnal framework adopted for the study is presented in Figure 2. The framework for the study. Figure 2. The framework for the study 6.3 A sampling of donors for the study Cohort 1 The sampling frame for Cohort 1, included donors, The Council has engaged with for the last ﬁve years (2016-21) were used. The sampling criteria for the donors is given below, 1. New : Donors that have started their engagement with The Council post-2018 for the ﬁrst time and currently have an active meeting with The Council. 2. Old: Donors who are currently not engaging with The Council but have engaged with them in the past. 3. Retained: Partners who have funded multiple projects for The Council and have active projects with The Council. 15 --- Page 17 --- Figure 4. Sampling distribution of donors considered for the study shows the universe of the 54 donors distributed across these categories Cohort 1 sampling caveats ● Level 1 - Stratiﬁed into three categories, i.e., New, Retained, and Old ● Level 2 – A control for focus area-wise and thematic area-wise representation ● Level 3 – A control for the maturity of engagement, and the no. of times the donor has engaged with The Council, the value derived etc. were used to arrive at the ﬁnal list of donors. Figure 3. Sampling distribution of donors considered for the study According to the criteria, 15 donors were sampled with 5 replacements ( Table 2. Cohort 1 donors sampled ) . Post the data collection, only a total of 12 donors agreed to be interviewed ( Table 3. Final List of Cohort 1 donors interviewed ). Table 2. Cohort 1 donors sampled S.

A very robust secondary research and expert consultation went into examining the funding landscape and proﬁles of different categories of donors and investors. The detailed ﬁndings from this second study are offered in the Annexures . For the purpose of sampling, the secondary research perspective suggested, 1. Philanthropic Houses / HNIs / Diaspora-led Funding Based on the typology of funding nature, i.e., the motivation of the donor, the giving intent and core-institutional funding; the potential donors for this approach could be shortlisted. E.g., Rohini Nilekani (from the perspectives of IIHS, Arghyam, Takshashila Institute etc.), and Luis Miranda (from the viewpoint of CCS), who have funded think tank institutional development and various causes. 2. Collaborative / Consortium-led approach Collaborative philanthropy 17 --- Page 19 --- The focus is on philanthropists and philanthropic organisations who rally around a shared idea, which demands not only pooling resources but also intersectional solutions and deployment at scale, enabling systems and environments. e.g., EDGE Funders Corporates collaboratively commit to a common cause Extending from the corporate sustainability collaborative channels, where the corporations and the associated value chain collaborate for a speciﬁc sustainability driver/actor. This is a potential area where the sectoral needs and advancements overlap with the regulatory direction, compliance, and market growth. e.g., Climate Pledge Fund 3. Research consortiums and platform approach In this approach, the proposition for The Council is to be the core research anchor in the research and knowledge platform. The core functions of the consortium would be governed by the core research group (The Council). The network would be membered by think tanks and research institutions committed to providing policy advice, essential sectoral research, and evidence generation across priority interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary sectoral and thematic areas, e.g., IDRC, UKRI, SSRC etc. While these are the above categories envisioned for cohort 2, based on multiple conversations with the leadership team at The Council, below are the ﬁnal categories chosen for cohort 2. 1. Philanthropists &amp;amp; Philanthropic Houses/HNIs/Diaspora-led funding Based on the typology of funding nature, i.e., the motivation of the donor, the giving intent and core-institutional funding; the potential donors for this approach could be shortlisted. E.g., Rohini Nilekani (from the perspectives of IIHS, Arghyam, Takshashila Institute etc.), and Luis Miranda (from the perspectives of CCS), who have funded think tank institutional development and various causes. 2. Collaboration with Incubators/Impact Investors Here, we are looking at impact investors who are operating in the space of climate &amp;amp; sustainability. This includes social business incubators, angel investors and impact inventors, as discussed earlier. We consider this as an exploration cohort where currently, there is limited engagement with this cohort, and there might be signiﬁcant changes required from The Council to tap into this cohort. E.g., Aavishkar, Yunus Social Business, Acumen etc. Based on this research typologies 1 and 2 were selected for shortlisting. Following this, a series of metrics were used to score the donors for ﬁnal selection. The larger theme of sustainability 18 --- Page 20 --- The investor should focus on sustainability with multiple investments in sustainability. Moving sustainability from the “Margin” to “Mainstream” is a critical agenda for The Council over the next decade and hence this is a crucial metric considered to ﬁnalise investors for Cohort 2. Past instances of funding non-proﬁts in addition to for-proﬁt enterprises Investors with a history of funding non-proﬁts would get a preference in our listing, as they are more likely to fund The Council. Funding nexus of sectors rather than focus on a single sector The funding nexus of sectors in the domain of climate, sustainability and energy is a key criterion for The Council. It is important for The Council to partner with investors who share a vision like that of The Council. Funding institutional development and not just sectoral outcomes The Council to achieve its goals in the next decade, focusing on investors who focus on ‘People’ and ‘Institutions’ is key. Investors focussing less on outcome-based funding and more on core funding would ﬁt better with the vision for The Council. CMS’ existing networking potential For CMS to access these investors, having existing relationships was important. According to the sampling criteria, 14 donors were identiﬁed for the study, of which 8 agreed to participate. The planned and completed donor interviews are detailed in Table 4.

This tool did not receive uptake and was subsequently dropped. The In-depth Interview (IDI)/KIIs were open-ended questionnaires with a contextualised approach to individual donors sampled across Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Figure 4. Proposed tools and interactions for the study , and Figure 5. Actual tools deployed and interactions for the study of the ﬁnal sets that were deployed. Figure 4. Proposed tools and interactions for the study Figure 5. Actual tools deployed and interactions for the study 20 --- Page 22 --- The interaction was open-ended, and the discussions evolved from the questions guided by the analytical framework. The interviews covered key aspects such as donors’ engagement with The Council, services they received, their value and impact, and aspects of The Council that distinguish them in the sector. During the interviews, the overall content of the questions was organic and remained consistent. However, the extent of coverage, the sequencing of the questions and the probes were modiﬁed to streamline and guide the conversations. 6.5 Study limitations and challenges The methodology for the perception survey among the donor community was conceived with two donor cohorts: Cohort 1: Donors who have collaborated with The Council in the past or are currently collaborating with The Council were sampled to capture the key donor perceptions on their interaction. Cohort 2: A sample of potential donors was curated based on the aspirations and Vision 2030 of The Council. The initial study design – sampling schema and study tools, varied from the design that was executed on account of limited response from the sampled respondents. The proposed study design, for instance, included the deployment of an online self-assessment tool for Cohort 1 donors, Key Informant Interviews (KII) and In-depth Interviews (IDI) with both cohorts and case studies. The self-assessment tool for Cohort 1, sent to 54 donors did not receive the expected uptake despite over six reminders being sent to the donors, including two from The Council CEO desk. Because of the low response, a collective decision was taken to not pursue the online self-assessment survey and to rather focus on the donor interviews. The successive case studies were also dropped, considering the response rates and the intensity of participation. 21 --- Page 23 --- In the interviews, the study managed to complete 80% of the planned interactions across both Cohorts. In a few cases, such as with MacArthur Foundation, UAF, Oak Foundation etc., CMS reached out via its existing networks as the contact details shared by The Council were obsolete or non-responsive. Few of these donors, despite acknowledging the invitation, did not respond. In Cohort 2, despite completing 80% of the planned interactions the biggest challenge was the lack of responses from the participants. This was especially so in the private equity space, where investors were not aware of The Council in particular or think tanks in general and struggled to connect with the study. The following sections on the sampling and tools capture both the proposed and the ﬁnal sets deployed. 22 --- Page 24 --- 7 The Climate Financing Landscape – Insights from the Secondary Research 7.1 Sources and extent of climate ﬁnancing Secondary research provided an overview of the signiﬁcant wave investments in the climate sector. The research component captured data on the primary ﬁnancing that was supporting climate resilience activities. The information sources include reports generated by bodies such as Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) 4 , International Energy Agency (IEA) 5 , Climate Funds Update (CFU) 6 etc. Global ● According to the most recent data from CFU, a total of USD 12,037 million had been pledged as of January 2022 for mitigation projects worldwide, of which USD 9,026.849 million had been approved. For adaptation, only USD 3,896 million was supported by 6 multilateral climate funds and initiatives. 7 ● According to CPI data, Renewable energy remains the primary destination sector for global climate ﬁnance tracked in the 2017/2018 Landscape, representing USD 337 billion annually, or 58% of international climate ﬁnance. 8 ● 53% of tracked private renewables ﬁnancing ﬂowed to solar PV, while wind accounted for an additional 40%. 9 ● Financing for low-carbon transport is increasing rapidly. Average annual ﬁnance to transport projects rose by 54% from its 2015/2016 level to USD 141 billion in 2017 and 2018. A rapid increase primarily led to the adoption of electric vehicles. 10 ● On average, annual climate ﬁnance ﬂows rose to USD 579 billion over the two years of 2017/2018, a USD 116 billion (25%) increase from 2015/2016. 11 ● Private ﬁnance reached USD 326 billion annually in 2017/2018, accounting for most of the climate ﬁnance, at around 56%. 12 ● Domestic, bilateral, and multilateral development ﬁnance institutions (DFIs) accounted for most of public ﬁnance. 13 ● Approximately 80% of all public energy R&amp;amp;D spending was on low-carbon technologies – energy efﬁciency, CCUS, renewables, nuclear, hydrogen, energy storage, and cross-cutting issues such as smart grids. Push for electro-mobility, and cleaner cars boosted overall corporate energy R&amp;amp;D spending. 14 14 World Energy Investment 2020 13 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 12 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 11 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 10 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 9 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 8 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 7 https://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard/themes/ 6 https://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard/themes/ 5 World Energy Investment 2020 https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020 4 Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2019 https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-ﬁnance-2019/ 23 --- Page 25 --- Asia 17 multilateral climate funds and apparel accounted for a total of USD 5.7 billion for 530 projects and programmes for 17 Asian nations in 2020. Between 2003 and 2020, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam received 64% of the funding approved for Asia. With mitigation receiving more signiﬁcant approval than adaptation, it accounted for 60% of the total ﬁnance, while adaptation projects and regional programmes received only 21% (USD 1.2 billion). 15 The Clean Technology Fund (CTF), Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Scaling up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries (SREP) were the largest funders of mitigation in the Asian region. Most mitigation funding supports large-scale renewable energy, energy efﬁciency and transport projects. The GCF provided the most signiﬁcant amounts for adaptation projects for a total approval amount of USD 385 million. 16 India As per the latest statistics, a considerable amount of ﬁnance has ﬂown to the fast-growing economy of India, primarily for mitigation projects. In 2021, India received funding with over INR 137.8 Crores in project approvals. The energy generation and renewable sources sector received the highest funding approval, followed by energy policy and energy. The GCF was the major contributor to funds in India, accounting for 81.4% (INR 112.3 Crores) of approvals in 2021. 17 7.2 Deployment of climate ﬁnancing across select support areas 18 The secondary ana lysis of the funding also focused on six types of support strategy, namely research and evaluation, capacity-building and technical assistance, network-building and collaboration, policy, advocacy and systems reform, participatory grant-making, outreach and general support from the year 2017 to 2019 speciﬁc to The Council core areas. As per the ﬁndings , the overall value of grants from 2017 to 2019 for different support strategies towards the sector of Climate Change and Natural Resources (Energy Efﬁciency, Fossil Fuels, Renewable Energy, Land Resources and Air Quality etc) accounted for USD 56 Million. Funding towards the sector of Natural Resources outpaced Climate Change receiving almost USD 55 Million with a total of 230 funders out of the total funding from 2017 to 2019. However, as per the Foundational Maps estimates, the funding value for the Natural Resource sector decreased by USD 11 Million from 2017/2018 to 2018/2019, due to the low ﬂow of funds towards Natural Resources There was an increase in the funding towards Climate Change related activities from USD 315,578 in 2017/18 to USD 708,494 in 2018/19 18 Foundation Maps 17 https://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard/ 16 Climate Finance Regional Brieﬁng: Asia 15 Climate Finance Regional Brieﬁng: Asia 24 --- Page 26 --- More than 50% of the total funding went towards Policy, Advocacy and Systems Reform support strategy estimated to be almost USD 32 Million out of USD 55 Million Out of the total grant value across the Natural Resources and Climate Change sector, capacity-building and technical assistance accounted for USD 12 Million, followed by outreach (USD 10 Million), network-building and collaboration estimated at USD 5 Million, and lastly, research and evaluation received USD 4 Million. Lastly, Axis Bank Limited, Reliance Industries Limited etc., emerged as the top funders from 2017 to 2019. This provides us with an overall picture of funding for R&amp;amp;D-related activities and some insights into the sector-wise ﬂow of funds and the trend and opportunities in India. The Council is positioned to take advantage of the new funding approaches. that could be leveraged by the Centre of Energy Finance, which has been deepening markets, increasing transparency, and attracting capital to emerging economies. Since 2019, the Centre of Energy Finance has also been designing the Common Risk Mitigation Mechanism to unlock ﬁnances for renewables and designing a multisectoral framework to compare and recommend mitigation instruments for India’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Scaling up India’s renewable energy (RE) targets to 175 GW of renewables by 2022 are some initiatives The Council has undertaken in the last couple of years in renewables. 7.3 Climate ﬁnancing approaches by domestic corporations and their CSR arms CSR funds are available consistently every year; however, there is a strategic misalignment, especially as they are channelled towards short-term projects or programmes but not evidence generation to inform policy, transformative causes or developing research institutions. Discussions with the sectoral experts depict that &amp;gt;90% of the research arrangements are driven by contractual service agreements for formative or summative programmatic research and CSR portfolio management, but rarely entertain grant-making approaches. In summary, there is no direct reference from the Indian sustainability landscape to capture the investments and outcomes from the research portfolio. Yet there are resounding research and development opportunities in providing insightful guidance in designing ﬁnancial products and services. Unless this is driven through government-funded incubation centres in academic institutions that could focus on energy and environment start-up models-both for-proﬁt and not-for-proﬁt, the sustenance of funds for effective think tank work would always be limited. Accordingly, there is a wider opportunity to inﬂuence access to ﬁnance, promoting sectoral initiatives and policy-level changes through sustainable ﬁnancing products in India. 7.4 Philanthropy in India In Indian domestic philanthropy has changed quite a bit in recent years; in terms of absolute numbers, the funding has grown from INR 12,500 crores in 2010 to INR 55,000 crores in 2018. A few Indian and Indian-origin families, which include Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Dr Romesh and Kathleen Wadhwani, Azim, and Yasmeen Premji, and Nandan and Rohini Nilekani are driving the increase in landmark commitments. These families have joined the Giving Pledge as well. 25 --- Page 27 --- 7.5 Key takeaways from secondary research Following are the areas from the perspective of The Council where there is a scope for engagement. 1. Research and advisory – In research and advisory services, assisting philanthropists in an evidence-based approach to deploying funds has been a fundamental value add. 2. Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning – Reporting is another critical area where a lot of movement has happened; this has promoted a culture of monitoring, evaluation and learning across the sector, which results in better donor reporting. 3. Collective, visioning, giving, and learning – Mobilising multiple stakeholders towards collaborative giving, resulting in the emergence of investment-ready solutions for large-scale impact. 26 --- Page 28 --- 8 Insights from The Council leadership The Council’s stakeholders interviewed were: 1. Mr Karthik Ganesan and Mr Mihir Shah – Partner engagement, Financing, and communication strategy. 2. Mr Vikas Pandey – Financial processes, enabler functions and grant-keeping approach 3. Ms Reman Singh – People strategy and HR functions. 4. Mr Abhishek Jain and Mr Vaibhav Chaturvedi – Partner engagement and Financing strategy. 5. Dr Arunabha Ghosh – Journey of The Council so far and Vision 2030. Discussions with Dr Arunabha Ghosh were synthesised to understand. ● Aspirations for Vision &amp;amp; Mission 2030 for The Council. ● The potential direction and sectoral impact The Council intends to create. ● The sectoral position The Council intends to occupy over the next decade. The conversation depicted the journey of The Council since its inception and its future aspirations as a pioneering research think tank in the climate and sustainability sector. To become a world-class institution in data, outreach, and analysis of global signiﬁcance with a focus on impact at scale, Moving sustainability from the “Margin” to “Mainstream” by working across the themes of policy, technology, ﬁnance, and behaviour to transition from an evidence-centric policy advisory body to actioning research, enable implementation at scale etc. This vision of The Council requires donors who work in domains of sustainability across the spectrum of food, agriculture, water, energy, etc. With the impending risk of the new FCRA laws, it is paramount that The Council looks at local donors who can participate in The Council’s journey going forward. These are donors that would: Invest in the institutional development of The Council and build the institutional capacities of the organisation. Invest in integrated ideas and do not restrict their funds to a speciﬁc sector/domain, make big bets to achieve transformation across the larger ecosystem and Support linkages of markets within and outside the country. Subsequently, the discussion with the portfolio leads and key personnel assisted in providing a holistic view of the various engagement and operational models, core strength of the institutions, value proposition, donor engagement strategies, and potential for impact across the portfolios and sector. The conversations with the enabler functions such as Finance and HR enabled an understanding of the key strengths and challenges within The Council. 27 --- Page 29 --- 8.1 Challenges and limitations The concentration of FCRA funds Most of the funding The Council currently manages has a high reliance on international grant-making agencies and donors. With the recent restrictions to the FCRA rules, there are clear concentration risks. The Council must pivot towards domestic funds (untied and institutional per se) to offset the risk posed by the high concentration of FCRA funds. Siloed leadership Most of the engagement and grant management is undertaken by the strategic leadership group at The Council. The key personnel group front ends the conversation from the process of lead generation, proposal making, engaging with donors, etc. However, the process is not institutionalised, and if strategic leaders exit The Council, there is a probability of The Council losing donors Outcome-based funding expectations Outcome-based funding and results-based funding have been picking up among grant-making agencies and donors over the last few years. This practice is constrained to leverage think tanks in the space of the institutional capacity building, institutional development, talent acquisition, etc. A genuine lack of untied programmatic funding is a constraint and a deterrent to the growth of grant-dependent institutions like research think tanks and especially so in the space of climate and sustainability. Effective advocacy and dissemination Maintaining a healthy communication system with the grant-making agencies and the donors is key to sustaining partnerships. However, The Council does not have a streamlined system (newsletters, update mailers etc.) as of now, indicated as a pain point by a few donors. Secondly, integrating various portfolios of activities, successes etc., is critical for the position of The Council and the network of domains and services offered. Thirdly, supporting or leading the communication of programmatic work, or donor collaborative communication, is a genuine area that collectively needs reinforcement. 8.2 Opportunities and strengths Leadership The vision of the think tank closely mimics the ethos and the vision of the leader, Dr Arunabha Ghosh, a big strength from the think tank’s perspective. His thought leadership, along with his vision for the sector, brings a lot of conﬁdence to The Council’s services and the impact the think tank creates. Over the last ten years, this energy has fuelled immense success for The Council in climate and sustainability. Dr Arunabha’s leadership and governance have been vital to this achievement and current positioning. 28 --- Page 30 --- Human Capital Researchers and policy experts have been at the centre of The Council, their value systems, and the core of the institution’s strategy. The most signiﬁcant value proposition of The Council stems from the human capital and competencies as a research think tank they possess in the sector. According to the human resources team, the attrition rates are meagre, and the tenures of its key strategic personnel have been long. They occupy the core of strategic leadership. The leadership values and the growth pathways are well deﬁned, linear and provide equal opportunities, e.g., Talent recognition, leadership grooming and fostering happen based on performance and effectiveness irrespective of their experience and years of association with the sector or the organisation. Transparency The Council takes a vocal stance within the sector and is objective and transparent in communicating the outputs, and evidence to the public, donors, and the government. Despite the positioning, the sector’s perception from the opinion of the leadership group is that The Council is conceived to be in close association with the government, and they leverage government strengths effectively. This positions The Council in a unique space within the sector where their services and engagements are fuelled by their ability to inﬂuence the process of policymaking, leveraging the strengths of the government objectively. Trendsetter approach The Council identiﬁes itself as solution expert and early mover in regard to shaping sectoral solutions, identifying critical problem statements, working at the intersection of sectors etc. The Council’s work in the cooling sector (in extension to the NCAP formulation) and the nation’s work on Hydrogen based fuels are good examples of a sector-shaping agenda for the future by gaining the early mover advantage. The intrinsic trendsetting approach stems from the value proposition that leverages social and human capital. This effectively allows The Council to experiment, take risks, and convince the investment ecosystem to focus on where the sector is moving towards. 29 --- Page 31 --- 9 Donor (Cohort 1) perceptions 9.1 Caveats to synthesising the perceptions of the donors Strong principles and approaches govern the donor perception mapping study. It is critical to keep in mind that, The primary data is highly qualitative and captures critical perceptions and sentiments from the donor communities. The donors have interacted with the evaluation team governed by trust and anonymity, and hence the synthesis must reﬂect their truest contexts and perceptions without a bias concealing their identity. The nature of questioning has been free ﬂowing, evolving with the expression of the donors (not all topics are covered for all donors). Opinions and the intensity of perceptions cannot be quantiﬁed using a linear approach. While the synthesis has attempted to categorise perceptions and opinions using a composite model of weightage, contexts and experiences are something the evaluation team have limited information about. Wherever appropriate and possible, the report has attempted to quote, highlight, and provide examples of the donor’s truest perception or sentiment without losing the essence and revealing the donor’s identity. Wherever appropriate and possible, we have adopted the Gestalt principles of perception by visualising examples and contexts provided by the donors – ﬁgure-ground relationship, proximity, similarity, continuity, closure etc. The perceptions and sentiments collected from interactions with the donors have been qualitative and highly contextual to their experience and engagement with The Council. While the analytical framework guides the overall lens of processing the perceptions and sentiment, given the nature of interviews being free ﬂowing, some perceptions were reactive; in contrast, some came after quick reﬂection during the interview. The study has consciously tried to eliminate any objective or conﬁrmation or information biases arising from donor conversations and secondary research. The perceptions and recommendations are processed not just on a certain percentage of donors expressing their views; instead, a weighted synthesis approach has been adopted, accounting for the following factors, wherever appropriate and possible, 1. Maturity of the relationship between the donor and The Council a. Longevity of the partnership/relationship with the institution or key personnel, b. Frequency and the intensity of the engagement – number of grants, the value of grants, nature of engagement (tied or untied funding) 2. Sectoral positioning – Donors’ positioning in the sector, the signiﬁcance through various sector shaping work, perceptions about the donor within the sector 30 --- Page 32 --- 3. Alignment to The Council’s vision 2030 – donor funding strategy, donor willingness for a long-term partnership, the possibility of future engagements etc. In addition to the above segmentations used for weightage, microelements such as ● the intensity with which the donors expressed their perceptions, ● the stress and emphasis on certain perceptions have also been factored in E.g., If a couple of donors voiced a perception through strong sentiments by providing instances and examples where they felt The Council could have done something different, for instance, that perception was provided higher weightage during synthesis. Assessment of perceptions using weights To illustrate how the above criteria are used, please refer to the example below. Let us consider Donor A, who has been engaging with The Council over a long-term association and has funded The Council multiple times; however, owing to certain limitations, Donor A is unable to fund The Council in the future. Donor B is a new donor, engaging with the council for the ﬁrst time; however, they are more closely aligned to the vision and the journey of The Council. Donor C has funded The Council more than once; however, the engagement is only transactional and does not broadly align with the vision and journey of The Council. Using the weighted synthesis approach, Donor B’s perceptions would rank higher than A as Donor B scores higher on criteria 2 and 3, whereas Donor A scores higher only on criteria 1. Donor C ranks the lowest based on the above-mentioned criteria. 9.2 The role of ideal Think Tanks A quick excerpt from the discussion with experts and guided literature Think tanks play a critical role in the value chain of social transformation. Orchestrating solutions to critical economic, social, and political issues are at its core. However, think tanks, by design, foster a network for thought leaders to collaborate, develop ideas and share knowledge. To decode further into the engagement mechanisms, their scope of work expanded from research initiatives to conducting ﬁeld surveys, collecting, and analysing data and publishing books, journals, and reports and amongst other things 19 . Shifting the axis of activities to generate visibility and political access has contributed signiﬁcantly to intense scrutiny of think tanks and the vagueness of characteristics that distinguish them, putting the credibility and the sectoral positioning of think tanks at risk. It is 19 Think tanks in South Asia: Analysing the knowledge–power interface 31 --- Page 33 --- common knowledge that think tanks exist to serve the nation’s interest and not a group’s interest. The role of think tanks is expected to uphold the quality of policy recommendations or offer a futuristic perspective without any keen interest in a plan. Many of these organisations operate on funds from the donor agencies to conduct their independent research work, which assists them in pursuing sector-shaping research agendas. Many think tanks use this funding to strengthen various aspects of the organisation and contribute to their sustainability. In terms of advocacy and dissemination, many think tanks in India as well as globally have advanced their communication and outreach strategy and increased their number of publications, both in their form and their medium. Think tanks have branched out to online content and utilising various interactive platforms. These elements serve as key quantiﬁable criteria for think tanks in assessing the impact of the work. While producing a higher quantity of outputs and broadening the outreach, substituted as an effective output metric, indicates the think tank’s relative capacity. However, the impact of content is not highlighted 20 . On the organisation management front, sound leadership and good governance were emphasised as the foundational elements of organisational stability. Expert opinions and donor perceptions converged on the fact that think tanks gain credibility and stability from a strategic leadership model that assures smooth succession and the development of a strong pool of leaders. If the leadership model is limited to the authority of the founding person or selected leader, then the models would fail to provide credibility overall in the absence of a leader. Moreover, the governance neutrality and legitimacy of think tanks served as one of the reasons for policy-making agencies to engage with them. Donor’s perception Despite the broadly shared characteristics, the discussions in capturing donor perceptions yielded considerable diversity among think tanks regarding their mandate, priorities, and structures in India. Some examples cited during our conversation with the donors included think tanks like TERI – covering a range of topics and sectors, including climate change, energy efﬁciency, renewable energy, agriculture, habitat, and social transformation as opposed to CPR, CPI functioning solely as a research institute. Triangulating the secondary research with the opinions from the donors spotlights that advocacy and dissemination through events and convenings were key qualities which provided think tanks a platform for effective policy discussion, capacity building, and networking, convening like-minded people to collaborate and promote high-level dialogues. However, it was also widely perceived that the convenings often took a toll on the effectiveness of research, and the knowledge dissemination role of the think tank has taken a back seat over recent year. Given the demand for sustaining the institutions, think tanks have started resorting to marketing ideas which could potentially lead to a change of priority of research by advocacy. 20 Think Tanks: The Quest to Deﬁne and to Rank Them 32 --- Page 34 --- In recent years, speciﬁc to the Indian context on think tanks funding, it was found that several think tanks faced constraints in pursuing the research agenda due to a lack of funds and faced challenges in garnering support from local philanthropy or government donors. These think tanks were left up to the government and a few international philanthropies to keep them aﬂoat. Through the study, the exploration to identify pathways for The Council to enhance its reach to multiple funders include: Expanding its scope of work and covering a broad range of domains and functions. Increasing their interaction through collaboration with other regional or international think tanks working on different areas. The expert comments and the donor perceptions converge in increasing the effectiveness of the involvement of think tanks in epistemic and policy communities in generating policy ideas and fostering debates and acting as a bridge between research and policy formulation. Many also debated on measuring their ability to attribute a policy change. The discussions provided visibility to various organisations and individuals as key stakeholders who could inﬂuence policies through various channels. The ability of think tanks to inﬂuence policy was also strongly shaped by external factors. Furthermore, the policy adoption process also involved broad consultation with many stakeholders, and thus the success to be claimed by one entity was fallacious. To better understand the whole paradigm of think tanks’ inﬂuence on policy outcome, based on the secondary research and donor perception, the research team have mapped it to Steve Covey’s model on Concern, Inﬂuence and Control. Figure 6. Steven Covey’s model of 3 concentric circles: 1. Control, 2. Inﬂuence, and 3. Concern 33 --- Page 35 --- The Circle of Control: Encompasses those circumstances/issues/problems which the think tanks have control over. Circle of Inﬂuence: Includes those circumstances/issues/problems that the think tanks have indirect control over. Circle of Concern, also known as the circle of no control: Encompasses the wide range of circumstances/issues/problems the think tanks have, but over which they have no control. Figure 6. Steven Covey’s model of 3 concentric circles: 1. Control, 2. Inﬂuence, and 3. Concern represents the ideal think tank model, and their activities are categorised under different circles of control, power and concern based on the perceptions of experts and donors. It explains where the real inﬂuence of think tanks falls. While think tanks have grown signiﬁcantly and demonstrated the capacity to execute unbiased research and analysis and provide policy recommendations to a range of audiences, there are complex, recurring, and tiered concerns amongst the institutions, most of which hold good concerning The Council’s scenario as well. The fundamental structural pillars of the activities and research of think tanks, i.e., independence, credibility, sustainability, and ideology, have a high chance of becoming frail and lagging when compromised. Since it is the responsibility of think tanks to determine whether their works demonstrate credibility and add value, it is worth noting whether it is time for them to rethink their overall strategy to address the emerging challenges. Further, consider actively engaging their audiences through carefully 34 --- Page 36 --- designed channels to reach the right people using the suitable method to ensure their goals are met. 9.3 Growth and development of think tank From the viewpoint of sectoral leadership and experts, broader contours of the key characteristics, roles, contributions, and services in policy debate have been critical in establishing the vision, mission and values of the institution. Given the Indian context and history of think tanks in the space of climate and sustainability, institutions have consistently performed various functions as knowledge creators, repositories and disseminators and provided expert policy advice based on research and policy-relevant issues. The experts, and donors observe that only when there is core funding and ﬂexibility afforded in utilisation of funds have think tanks been able to attract talent and experience operational resilience or stable growth Key Positives Opportunities to improve Values are observed across the value chain of services provided by The Council Engages with donors strategically providing avenues to collaborate beyond the project scope of work Conduct robust and sector shaping research Engages with global, national, and local governments and stakeholders and possesses the positioning and power as a sector-leading think tank Dr Arunabha Ghosh is an exemplar leader guiding the think tank. Has dictated Sectoral Thought-Leadership Potential to become a global think tank with effective positioning strategy Leverage as a power player locally by expanding the current scope of work beyond research and advocacy Potential to syndicate research, create an effective product line that can be taken to scale across the sector and funders Often observed mirroring the voices of the government which dissonates independence as a value Occupies an elitist positioning with communication and outreach (often found to taking only the top-down approach) In instances of multiple grants with the same donor, a resolute grant management team and decluttering of administrative processes is the expectation Recognition as a refreshing think tank Two critical attributes were highlighted by the donors as success metrics to The Council concerning their development. 35 --- Page 37 --- 1. Quick evolution over the decade since its inception with quality, rigour, and competitiveness. 2. Diversity of domains and functions within the sector, i.e., clearly the depth of work across each vertical, ability to attract funds from a diverse set of donors etc. The Council was consistently referred to as leading the climate and sustainability think tank space. The institution is considered continually active in policymaking. It is perceived to occupy a unique market position, having healthy donor relationships, and possessing key partnerships, which have been built effectively over the last decade since its inception. Most of the preliminary engagements over the past decade are attributed to The Council being a fresh and inﬂuential voice in the sector (40% of the donors); now, gradually, donors are recognising the institutional capacities and strengths. The donor networks from Cohort 1 engaging with The Council view it as a refreshing think tank. Donors also highlighted that The Council’s young and vibrant team makes them unique within this think tank space. According to them, a younger and vibrant think tank was socially engaging as compared to other mature think tanks in the climate and sustainability space, receptive to independent policy research and able to conceive and work on complex hypotheses. There was greater freedom in investment decision-making and the ability to diversify work within the sectors, and sub-sectors and focus on sub nationals’ geographies. The Cohort 1 donors felt that in future those donors who would be excited by new opportunities would be keen to collaborate with The Council Having a young and energetic team is The Council’s strength. Their teams have the capacity to ideate and innovate with the sectoral experts who are members of Government committees and state-level authorities. They quite often pursue futuristic research. However, there was also a perception that possession of characteristics of agility and receptiveness limit this typology of think tanks from building long-term ﬁnancial and organisational sustainability. This view was predominant among the donors collaborating with The Council who have been working for a more extended period (25% of the overall sample). Values and Virtues The core values and principles imbibed by The Council are: ● Being integrated into analysis, ● International/global outlook, ● Independent of funders and clients, and ● The commitment to building careers in public policy. The vision and the values of The Council are triangulated by: ● Their self-perception, ● The perception of its donors and key partners and ● The authenticity of the perception from the public and the sector. 36 --- Page 38 --- The Council is perceived to be exhibiting a high degree of independence in conducting the research and advocating the ﬁndings despite any sensitivity around the ﬁndings. Four of the donors who responded, cited this perception with instances ranging from disseminating to the practitioners or decision-makers to the public. Diving deeper into speciﬁc value systems, donors highlighted the balance between being an independent and objective research entity, i.e., the ability to generate evidence with robustness and rigour, to interpret the data in its truest relationships with the ecosystem, may it be the geo-political systems, socio-cultural systems, or the market and economic systems Usually, there is immense pressure from evolving environments and relevance, integrity, and efﬁcacy in the face of diverse political, economic, and academic interests are increasingly becoming challenging. As a leading voice in India’s climate and sustainability sector, The Council occupies a unique position and has an opportunity to make a signiﬁcant difference. There are real and burning concerns around issues such as transition, and social responsibility, where The Council has the independence and the power to voice their opinion and ignite exciting deliberations. Even within the limits of the FCRA, The Council has established an image of having an independent position and has the impact of being a leading voice in India positively. Two donors who responded in this regard, acknowledged that while The Council adjusted their strategy to meet donor expectations, they did not compromise on the true ﬁndings of the sectors, thereby maintaining their ambitious standards and values of research. They were also able to integrate their efforts across all sectors and build a comprehensive approach that drew in prospective donors. The Council considers the donor’s expectations and co-creates the design and strategy for the study. However, we have not encountered an instance where there is a compromise in the ﬁndings. The objectivity in research is of higher order to the expectations of the funding institution. The Council, on the other hand, was viewed by a subset of funders as being dependent on the government for obtaining FCRA approval which complicated its positioning as being independent and might threaten the long-term sustainability of The Council. Three donors expressed this perception. An integrated domain approach in research demands an immense understanding of various domains and functions. Given that the climate and sustainability sector is complex, understanding the true extent of needs and staying adept at emerging needs and markets is critical to take an integrated and intersectional approach. One example highlighted by the donor was the Powering Livelihoods initiative, which takes an integrated approach by converging multi-sectoral issues, solution hypotheses and modelling for scale. Integration should be a key component of The Council’s work and the heart of any think tank’s strategy. The Powering Livelihoods programme, where The Council is the lead knowledge partner, has a holistic strategy focused on the integrated climate and livelihood sector outcomes. 37 --- Page 39 --- With strong values and perceptions imbibed by The Council, numerous counterarguments have been shared by the donors. The Council has orchestrated and executed high-quality work using original data over the last decade. Three donors highlighted that The Council often claims attribution to the outcome or impact of various policy decisions and sectoral inﬂuences. The donor cited articles, op-eds, and social media posts where The Council has overtly acknowledged and taken credit during instances such as India’s commitment to net zero, the successful creation of the International Solar Alliance, etc. The donors further highlighted that the trend is not just limited to the institution in the public space, but also by members using social media to attribute successes to themselves. The Council tries to project their contribution as attribution in many instances. One recent example would be during the COP-26 summit, when Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s Net Zero Commitment and an action plan for the target year, 2070; The Council is one of the many claimants to contend how various pieces of their work in the sector, their contributions in the steering committees etc. have been directly responsible for India’s stance. It came from their CEO’s handle. This approach is something The Council must reﬂect upon. Not every statement by the government and recent trend needs to be cross-validated from their platforms and claimed credit. The perception of claiming attribution larger than the proportionate share was of three prominent donors who scored high across the criteria deﬁned earlier . A few other donors did mention this in passing but did not highlight this as a key issue. A Donor’s Voice The Donor’s Proﬁle Independent philanthropy that aims to improve the lives of vulnerable groups. Keeping sustainability at the core of everything, they have continued to provide philanthropic leadership and build deeper collaborations with funding partners. Climate Change remains key to their work, and they are currently working with a wide range of organisations to scale up climate action. They have a growing climate portfolio in India. The Donor’s perceptions The donor acknowledged and highlighted the remarkable expansion of The Council in the ﬁeld of climate change and the appetite of The Council to conceive and approach complex climate issues and pursue research and advocacy in innovative, integrated ﬁelds under climate change effectively. The donor considered The Council’s vision cohesive throughout their interaction and saw the potential of them developing into a global think tank. The Council&amp;#x27;s rise as a sector-shaping think tank, the need to diversify their funding sources, their fundraising strategy, and their need to raise more money for institution and capacity development are all perceived by donors. Instead of relying only on foreign, grant-based sources of income, there is a focus on the think tank utilising domestic funding opportunities through collaboration with local governments and local CSR funds. The Council, in this regard can learn from organisations like DA and TERI, for whom a diversiﬁed funding approach assisted in pursuing ﬁnancial sustainability. However, learning what funding approach works 38 --- Page 40 --- for think tanks came with decades of experience and experimentation. In the context of The Council, early adoption of various ﬁnancial instruments, product and service-driven strategies can assist achieving ﬁnancial autonomy and bring stability to their growth. Additionally, the donor recommended that The Council should develop a sustainable growth strategy that would allow geographical and partnership decentralisation as opposed to coming across as a Delhi-centric think tank working mostly at the national level. This approach would allow The Council to deepen its impact within India while deepening the current strategy to work towards an outward-facing global positioning. The donor opined that The Council should facilitate the assimilation of their ideas and expertise across the country and increase awareness about their function and role. It was highlighted that The Council lacked the desire to establish a collaborative working relationship with other think tanks and institutions in the space of climate and sustainability. As a pragmatic way forward, the donor suggested that The Council prioritise their work through an inclusive, collaborative approach. Our ﬁrst conversation with Dr Arunabha was more centred on his success and achievements and provided the potential for little scope for growth inside the organisation. The second line of leadership is too reliant on Dr Arunabha. They need to create opportunities for the second round of leaders. Furthermore, the human resource at The Council was regarded as highly competent and exhibited analytical skills with the ability to conduct meaningful research in diverse ﬁelds. However, they cited the absence of the second line of leadership by stating that the organisation’s dependency on a single leader could damage the institutional capacity. Regarding the argument of contribution and attribution, especially in a think tank space, the donor perceived that The Council had a general pattern of claiming the credit of high-level success as theirs. They further mentioned that such success stories wear the ﬁngerprints of many hands and would be highly unusual to give credit to a single entity. Lastly, the donor noted that being an independent and young organisation, The Council showed massive growth in 10 years and was one of the few think tanks that displayed high-quality work in the sector of Climate Change. However, they pointed out that The Council’s views were often dictated by the government’s concerns and were prone to reﬂect the opinions of the ministry/government bodies. They suggested that being an independent organisation, their work needs to be focused on projects the real-world faces, offering an unbiased and independent perspective. Key takeaways Strengths Opportunities Ideas for future Quality of research, ability to be bold, complex set of issues to work with Absence of collaborative approach – Co-creating ideas, innovations and transformative work with other think tanks and institutions within the sector Diversiﬁcation of the funding strategies and approaches Young, competent human capital Concentration in terms of funding approaches – grant-based, global Expansion model 39 --- Page 41 --- philanthropic funds, mitigation driven Quality in convenings, advocacy and dissemination levers Delhi centric, national level think tank positioning 9.4 Sector shaping position and power One of the widely recognised and desirable think tank positioning framing statements highlighted by the experts, The ability of the institution to facilitate policy engagements and inﬂuence change amongst the key decision makers. The key driving factors in the sectoral positioning are 1. Independence from the geo-political domain inﬂuences actors and stakeholders. 2. Relationships and sentiments with the civil societies and the overarching research communities. 3. Bridging the demands – evidence, information, convenings etc. between various policy actors. 4. Ability to express the ﬁndings and insights objectively, despite interdependencies and sensitivity, without losing the essence. Hence, capturing the positive and negative perceptions and sentiments around the positioning of the think tank from multiple perspectives across the factors mentioned above is critical. Reiterating a few perceptions from the previous segments, independence across various actors in the ecosystem had mixed perceptions. Common perceptions from the donors were that The Council exhibited a high degree of independence in conducting the research and advocating the ﬁndings and interpretations. Regarding communication of the outputs, some donors acknowledged that while The Council adjusted their strategy to meet donor expectations, they did not compromise on the true ﬁndings of the sectors, thus maintaining their ambitious standards and values of research and integrity. Experts and donors also perceived that the communication strategy leaned toward the elite within the sector. By not engaging adequately with practitioners and populations the opportunity to leverage communication as a change lever is weakened. 40 --- Page 42 --- The facets of working with the local and national governments, navigating the geo-political inﬂuences effectively etc., are perceived as traits that are in the process of getting institutionalised, and Dr Arunabha Ghosh as a leader, has been a great exemplar. Donors also said that The Council possess great power in the climate and sustainability ecosystem in promoting and disseminating their products, such as reports and articles and the effectiveness of their communication on social media platforms. However, on the contrary, a subset of donors (25% of the responded sample) also perceived that The Council, during convenings, events and policy dialogues, become over-reliant on the government stakeholders and other key stakeholders in the government system. Sometimes, the convenings extended to voicing government opinions and prioritise issues which were seen as important for the government as well. With independence as a value, such behaviour could be interpreted as a bias. The Council&amp;#x27;s position is hard-lined, like the government, and as an independent think tank, they should desist from merely being a voice of the government. The Council is well positioned to underline India’s strengths and areas for growth. They possess a fantastic opportunity to move ahead rather than getting bogged down by their close associations with the government entities and their opinions. There is a clear narrative to The Council’s recent highlighted work in the climate and sustainability space. If you closely observe the communication around the Kigali Amendment and work on the hydrogen markets, the narrative deviates from the actual sectoral needs to what ﬂoats with the geo-political narrative or the current trend. Such priorities derail the focus of The Council as a research think tank and its accurate positioning. As a result, their capacities are visibly getting stretched. This is more of a bandwagon approach rather than strategic positioning. Donors also highlighted the sectoral capital that The Council possesses to inﬂuence stakeholders globally and nationally. This virtue serves as a driving factor for global philanthropies and funding institutions focusing on India as a market, especially in the climate and sustainability sector. Given that The Council intends to expand its footprints globally, the donors recommended that The Council must increase its positioning strategy and build traction on its international participation in global events and conferences. Some argued that since India is a critical market in the Climate Change sector, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation, The Council was ideally equipped to be a frontrunner in this domain and had an edge in attracting global funders keen on India as a market. It was also highlighted that they have strong ties with major stakeholders in the energy sector and might become champions in representing India rather than operating on a global scale. Adding to the perception, since there is a good amount of traction from The Council working closely with the national, and sub-national level and with the local governments, the expectation from donors is to venture into actioning the research on-ground through collaboration and taking the good practices and experience to the global arena with the expansion strategy in mind. 41 --- Page 43 --- As a part of the thought leadership lever, The Council brings a diverse set of stakeholders onto a single page and develops consensus, translates great ideas into action, ensures uptake of ideas by decision-makers, and leads vital debate amongst civil societies. 9.5 Funding and grant-making expectations FCRA has been the cornerstone law the donors and grant-making agencies emphasised regarding how their grant-making process is governed by regulating non-proﬁts and grantee organisations in India for receiving funding. Post the FCRA Act implementation, regranting to The Council through other organisations is no longer a viable option. The intention was to have minimum paperwork and transfer the onus into the hands of the aggregator. However, post the Act, we have transformed to funding them directly. Donors who participated in the study were distributed across the type of funding strategies they preferred. A subset of donors had clear preferences of funding pledged to research and evidence generation. Some donors did choose to provide untied grants allowing ﬂexibility for the grantee to use it across the programme or their initiatives. Donors highlighted the diversity and relevance of services offered by The Council and perceived them as the sector leading think tank in the climate and sustainability sector at this time. When nudged to elaborate on the cost-effectiveness of the services provided or the value for funding, nothing speciﬁcally was highlighted by the donors despite ongoing or past engagements. One of the key traits the donors are looking for in grantees is the ability to be initiative-taking in suggesting various aspects of fund utilisation and avenues for ﬂexibility across the value chain of policy research. The Council is often perceived to consider the donor’s suggestions and adjust their strategy per the donor’s needs. The Council is perceived to follow a good model and process of engaging with the donors. Instead of pursuing many donors transactionally at merely a project level, like-minded donors were frequently strategically engaged. In terms of engaging with The Council, all the donors highlighted that the administrative processes (legal document vetting, processing of invoices etc.) could be improved, with the time taken being the common complaint. 50% of the donors shared strong views on the grant-making process. They suggested that incorporating a fundraising team would be helpful given that the number of instances of grants or programmes is increasing, and managing multiple long-term budgets becomes critical. The senior researcher, as a key account manager, might not be self-sufﬁcient. As a philanthropic organisation, we have a clear strategy that deﬁnes fund allocation only for programmatic funds. There are no provisions for institution or core funding. Also, the administrative component of the funds needs to be capped at 20%, which provides limited independence to the grantees. Even when a grantee receives successive funding for the same programme or a new programme, the laws and regulations governed by our strategy do not provide additional ﬂexibility in the process of granting. 42 --- Page 44 --- The Council takes more time to sign agreements and the engagement processes. Their due diligence and legal processes are vital, but the processes are repetitive. If they still partner with the same grant-making agency, the process does not necessarily need to start from nothing. A resolute fundraising team and an administrative guideline can be helpful for The Council in addition to the programmatic teams engaging with us. Regarding the fundraising strategy, the donors highlighted the gap in The Council’s strategy to build alternative business models and offer diverse value propositions such as syndicating their research outputs, frameworks, tools etc. The think tank’s reliance on foreign funding, especially philanthropies and foundations, is currently high. As a recommendation, it was highlighted that focussing on diversiﬁed approaches for engagement and offering new services (policy to action research, incubating and implementing sectoral solutions etc.) can help widen the current fundraising paradigm. 43 --- Page 45 --- Key Takeaways: The discussions between the donors and The Council presented the following takeaways. The nature of the think tank and how the values and principles are imbibed into their work is critical to the positioning of the sector a. The needs vary across a spectrum for a conventional research consulting organisation versus an academically inclined and socially engaging think tank. b. Values such as independence are critical for a think tank that is more socially engaging. c. Upholding the values such as independence comes at the cost of positioning while engaging consistently with national and local governments. d. International donors and grant-making organisations prioritise think tanks practising the principles such as gender equity and sustained staff wellbeing indicators. However, think tanks ﬁrst need core funding for leadership and institutional development, before they can focus on areas such as gender equity and staff well-being. e. Focus on sector-shaping research, the ability of the think tank to inﬂuence donors into investing in sectoral needs and gaps. Strengthening the quality control and quality assurance processes for better aggregating sectoral goods. 2. With modest funding needs, The Council is eventually looking for a core grant and institutional grant approach to support a. Positioning The Council as a sectoral thought leader by facilitating evidence and information to key stakeholders and decision-makers to help orchestrate solutions for the critical sectoral issues. b. Institutional development and capacity development of the human capital. c. Bridge the gap in information and knowledge to sustain sector shaping research before the issues and solutions are funding ready. d. Improving the levers and actors from policy recommendations to policy change or action (needs system strengthening). 3. Long-term core grants with an institutional funding component are essential for The Council. This will develop institutional strength and resilience, including governance and leadership development, in addition to focussing on widening the research portfolios, enabler functions such as communications and PR 4. The Council is set on a path targeted for expanding access to untied/unrestricted funds and diversiﬁcation of funding to ensure institutional sustainability and ﬁnancial independence. Insights converging from the conversations with donors indicate that the transition towards syndicating research, creation of core products (that could be replicated across domains and functions, mobilisation of local philanthropy, syndication of academia, training, and technical support etc.) are vital services and business models for The Council to focus upon going forward. 44 --- Page 46 --- 9.6 Quality of networks, engagement, and approaches To understand the engagement strategy, speciﬁcally, the quality of engagement and working with the sector-shaping investors or donors, it is critical to benchmark it with peers. The donor portfolio of think tanks in the sector like CSE, DA or ORF mirrored synergies. The peers (data collated from their annual reports) are working with ● MDBs or DBs like The WB Group and ADB. ● Philanthropic foundations such as Hewlett Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Oak Foundation, Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, Ikea Foundation etc., ● Bilateral agencies such as The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) or the national &amp;amp; ● Local governments such as Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, West Bengal Government, Department of Environment, Government of Delhi, etc. The Council is also found closely collaborating with the donor and investor networks. Key Positives Opportunities to improve Highly competitive and competent engagement strategy with donors. Ability to listen to the donors, co-creates strategies at the programme / initiative level. All donors expressed a willingness to collaborate on a long-term with some expectations. The Council intrinsically ﬁts many of the criteria that some donors have for selection of grantees/partners Diversity in resources and subject matter experts engaging at the programme or initiative level High ability to create sectoral impact and sectoral assets is a crucial virtue the donors expect Think tank ratings do not factor much in the decision-making process of the donors while engaging Remarkably high social capital in the sector and possesses great networks to convene the right stakeholders during advocacy and dissemination Senior leadership and researchers being key Ability to collaborate with multi-faceted stakeholders such as CSOs/NGOs, incubators etc. and working beyond the value chain of research and advocacy for sustained partnerships Ability to collaborate with peer institutions and other think tanks during programmes or convenings needs to be initiative-taking For sustained partnerships, widening the current service and value propositions is a key (syndication of research) Too much dependency on Dr Arunabha and speciﬁc essential leaders to anchor partnerships. The Council needs diversiﬁcation and capacity building. 45 --- Page 47 --- account managers assist in building partnerships and relationships with the institution Interacting with the various donor agencies in the study revealed that a good mix of sector-strategic donors was actively engaged, highlighting the quality of engagement of The Council and the impact being created in the sector. Given the diversity of donors being engaged and the variety in the programmes and resources, the perceptions about the engagement and partnership strategy were inﬂuenced by several factors. Overall, The Council’s engagement strategy was deemed competitive and highly competent, though each donor had a unique perspective on the engagement model adopted by The Council. The council was proactive, considered the views of multiple stakeholders under the programme, and integrated the insights to alter their operational strategy. Donors highlighted that The Council was able to add signiﬁcant value to each of their partnerships. The following characteristics were recognised and appreciated: ● The ability to network and convene key stakeholders, ● Engaging diverse clientele, stakeholders, and the presence of subject matter experts in critical discussions, ● The ability to constitute and deliver logical and powerful research hypotheses, ● The ability to foster sector-shaping discussions, ● Assistance in re-strategizing their investments and disseminating funds. In summation, The Council’s credibility, technical knowledge, and capacity to do advocacy and networking, as well as its ability to hold convening, were identiﬁed as key strengths that foster effective engagement with the donor communities and the sector. All donors unanimously identiﬁed the quality of research and networking as the top strengths of The Council. A Donor’s Voice Context A donor motivated by SDG 13 fuelled the vision of a sustainable world, focusing on mitigation programmes under climate change. They support the design and development of robust and practical policy solutions that promote climate action. Additionally, they seek to inspire ideas for expansive, highly effective policy responses to India’s climate concerns. The Donors’ perceptions The rapid growth of The Council in the energy and climate change sector was perceived as the most valued strength by the donor. They considered high ambition the propelling factor in becoming a prominent organisation in a brief time. The donor raised the concern that due to 46 --- Page 48 --- the Council’s fast expansion; the quality of its deliverables has suffered. They stressed the lack of depth in the reports published as well. The donor praised The Council&amp;#x27;s capacity to curate and host insightful sessions as a key strength. They also expressed their satisfaction with their overall reporting and delivery system. They acknowledged the contributions made by The Council in the policy space and their ability to generate evidence-based knowledge. They voiced their concerns about The Council’s reluctance to collaborate with other think tanks in the sector. Additionally, they claimed that the institution’s self-projection was evident, which occasionally created a perception that institutional development was more important than the policy issues they were attempting to address. The donors cited a few engagement metrics as being essential for sustained funding. They placed a strong emphasis on the calibre of the think tank’s research (number of peer-reviewed publications; the number of policy inﬂuences etc.) and the provision of a precise set of objectives detailing what they aspire to accomplish (Vision 2030 and the contribution to SDG &amp;amp; Climate goals). Additionally, they stated that the funder did not consider awards or think tanks’ ranking in a global index as an important parameter while evaluating. In terms of leadership, Dr Arunabha is regarded as a strong, competent leader with a solid grasp of the political environment. The donor stressed the clear disconnect between Dr Arunabha and the second level of leadership, indicating a dearth of leadership abilities there. The donor emphasised the necessity for developing the next generation of leaders for the institution to ﬂourish successfully and sustainably. Key takeaways Strengths Opportunities Ideas for future Rapid growth in the sector, ability to hold convening with diverse stakeholders Resistance to collaborate with peers Build the capacities of the second line of leaders Great leadership skills Self-projection, lack of depth in the reports published Bring analytical skills in the content Presence in different states Fixated on single leader The power of networks Dr Arunabha’s social capital is well established in various sections of this report and is a catalyst for the success of The Council’s networking and convening efforts for effective policy dialogue. This positively correlates with improving the effectiveness of the think tank’s advocacy and dissemination levers. From the perception of the donors, The Council’s social capital has a domino effect on inﬂuencing the policymaking and the decision-making levers. 47 --- Page 49 --- The Council’s social capital was perceived to be highly sustainable, i.e., consistently key actors and stakeholders (sometimes the same experts; but they are critical for making effective decisions) participate in their policy-oriented research, analysis, and dissemination. From the donors’ perspective, the possession of inﬂuencing social capital and the ability to bring the key actors and stakeholders together is a key virtue that guarantees sustained engagement. Some of the examples highlighted by the donors included ● the effort of networking in successfully enabling the platform for the International Solar Alliance (ISA), speciﬁcally the efforts of Dr Arunabha Ghosh, ● industry and business-centric convenings for the UN High-Level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE) 2021, ● formulation and implementation of the India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP), and ● supporting the National Green Hydrogen Energy Mission. The Council can be ranked as one of the top think tanks in the sector regarding its social capital, networking capabilities, and technical knowledge. Their researchers are part of the GOI steering and planning and policy committees, providing key inputs in policymaking and implementation. The Council does possess good inroads with the sector’s policy circle (government), and their research, report and data are credible and are widely accepted by the government and other stakeholders. Despite the social capital that The Council possesses, donors opined that they lacked the intent to collaborate with their peers or other think tanks within the sector (4 donors). While donors highlighted how relationships and partnerships were fostered while allying, it was perceived that there is an underlying discomfort with collaborating or co-creating with peers in the same ecosystem. We sometimes felt hostile while collaborating with The Council, especially during policy convenings and dialogues. The Council becomes territorial during the engagement. While trying to create a shared vision, even while we pitch in as an equitable partnership, the same intent will not reciprocate. The ﬂow of intent is often unilateral. Perceptions on building partnerships and sustained engagement Donors’ polar inclinations were noted as they described their partnership sustenance strategy. Five of the donors who responded in this regard did not appear to have strict evaluation standards when working with academic institutes or think tanks. To reach a wider audience within the domains of functions, the donors appear to collaborate with several grantee groups. On the other end of the spectrum, four donors who responded had clear preferences and perceived the following factors as critical: ● Social capital (relationships with the governments, ability to convene key stakeholders), ● Diversity of subdomains in the climate and sustainability space, ● National and sub-national presence, quality of research outputs and knowledge pieces and, 48 --- Page 50 --- ● Ability to inﬂuence policy making. They intended to engage with only the pioneering think tanks in space. Considering things from a micro lens, the donors’ primary drivers for partnerships and sustained funding approach included factors such as ● Number of policies convenings in the domain area, ● Cost-effectiveness of generating evidence and policy outcomes, ● Total number of studies ongoing/completed in the respective domains of engagement, ● Ability to sustain outcomes and impact in the sector. What counts as a successful partnership for us is the impact through collaboration we create. Clear, concise, and measurable search and policy study action are critical. From our perspective, The Council does splendid work and follows through with clear action points for the sector. Additionally, they build good relations with the key stakeholders in the ecosystem. Advocacy and action delivery are where they excel. The donors used various tools, modalities, and techniques to fund The Council. Depending upon the nature of the funders, some of the criteria highlighted by the donors which served as critical factors for ﬁnalising the grantees and factors that fostered a long-term partnership were: ● The extent of the sectoral impact, ● Ability to advocate ﬁndings with diverse stakeholders or policymakers, ● Incorporation of cross-cutting, intersectional issues, ● Mitigation of adverse impacts on the environment/human rights, ● Alignment with the value system of the donor agencies, ● Values such as transparency, openness to collaborate, ● Ability to transform the thoughts of funding agencies, ● Stable, capable, mature, and sustained leadership and, ● Agile, competent, and dynamic programmatic team. A subset of donor institutions expressed an interest in continuing to collaborate with The Council and becoming a long-term partner. Some donors also indicated that they would expect the nature of the institution to mature into actioning their research, collaborating with the CSOs/NGOs to implement the models to scale. This could strengthen collaboration and partnership. A few donors highlighted the importance of The Council working toward building more bottom-to-top approaches and on-ground action pathways, which they are on the lookout for from their research partner. One respondent mentioned alignment with the strategy, such as gender inclusion as a driving factor. The Council needs a coherent organisation-wide strategy and a clear top-down strategy on gender inclusion which shall not be limited to having a few people enthusiastic about working within the sector. 49 --- Page 51 --- Importance of think tank ratings for donors While evaluating the partners, the donor’s approach had a clear dichotomy. Some donor decisions were based on merit, some on comfort, some on sectoral visibility, and so on. However, this was not a standard practice applied across all decisions by many donors. Even for the institutions chosen based on their excellence, expertise and sectoral position, utilisation of think tank ratings and global rating systems was not of great interest or a point of contention with the donors. Close to 40% of the donors stated that think tank awards and rankings were not signiﬁcant elements that inﬂuenced their engagement with an agency as much as their experience with the institution. Assurance of senior leadership managing the engagement Research portfolio leads and programme leads engaged with donor agencies. This was reported by donors as agreeable since they received adequate downtime with sectoral experts and were assured of the quality of outcomes. The ﬁnance team was involved only in accounting, legal and compliance requirements. However, institutionalising this as a good practice is important to building leaders in the long term. Key takeaways 1. While The Council has a good engagement strategy with the donor communities: a. Sustaining partnerships is highly correlated with the shared value creation potential b. Expanding the value proposition and services beyond the scope of current offerings requires – i. Actioning the research, expanding to policy implementation. ii. Co-creating solutions and designs with CSOs/NGOs and implementation organisations. iii. Incubating solutions, creating market-led business cases, and understanding the levers of scale. iv. Involvement in ecosystem-level strengthening such as sectoral capacity development, training, and knowledge management systems. 2. To strengthen the partnership levers and leverage the power of networks it is necessary: a. To improve the cohesion of collaborating with the peer institutions and competitive think tanks (4 donors) . b. For donors to be open to funding collaboratives with various actors in the system perceived as collaborating for impact. c. To leverage funding for complex and intersectional issues where the risks of failure or inaction are distributed across the collaborating partners. 3. Institutional capacity development and mitigation of the key person risk a. Reducing the dependency on Dr Arunabha and certain key stakeholders to anchor key relationships (50% of the donors) . b. Widen and diversify relationships with local donors, local philanthropy, and a healthy second line of leadership to anchor and sustain partnerships. 50 --- Page 52 --- Donor Deep-Dive Context A foundation with a vision to improve the quality of life of vulnerable populations. They are dedicated to addressing the underlying causes of poverty and the effects of climate change. They have invested in supporting the poorest communities’ efforts to cope with and adapt to climate change. Donor perception’s The donor observed that The Council’s overall structure and values were impressive and appreciated its rapid growth and accomplishments in a brief period. They noted that The Council continued to be cost-effective despite establishing itself as a prominent thought leader in the sector. Regarding fostering partnerships, the donor acknowledged The Council’s approach of developing the initial value proposition before approaching like-minded donors to be pragmatic. As a way forward, the donor stressed the importance of strengthening this aspect of The Council, which might help in gaining the support of funders. The donor also stated that this created a good working model where the think tanks develop the initial proposition, which is more appealing than designing the programme around the donor proposition. CEEW builds the value proposition and reaches out, and ﬁnds synergies with the donor, thus providing an encouraging environment to work and engage. We ﬁnd the proposition more valuable when our marketing team reaches out. Additionally, if the programme or on-the-ground staff offers these value propositions, they become more compelling to receive funding. The donor listed a few elements that would preclude ﬁnancing for a certain think tank. They claimed that because of the nature of the industry, many partners or organisations operating in this ﬁeld have a signiﬁcant amount of overlap in their work areas, which places a great deal of reliance on donors. Additionally, the donors are constantly evolving, so if there is an excessive reliance on one group of donors, any abrupt change in grant allocation might jeopardise think tank ﬁnancing. To this, they stressed the necessity for The Council to emphasise expanding their donor base and not being overly reliant on one source of funding. The donor noted that the research undertaken by The Council was credible and was widely accepted among government and other stakeholders. They noted that The Council were inﬂuential in disseminating their learning and reports and organising convening sessions with high-level stakeholders. They commended them for being initiative-taking in their engagement with the donor and for being transparent about their work, including sharing insights on the challenges they encountered during the study. Regarding human capital, the donor considered The Council&amp;#x27;s human resources as competent. They made a point of highlighting the organisation&amp;#x27;s high degree of decentralisation and the absence of senior management involvement in the programming procedures. They found the second tier of leadership to be empowered to report on their development. The donor recommended decentralisation as a course of action for The Council regarding succession planning and scaling up. 51 --- Page 53 --- Key takeaways Strengths Opportunities Ideas for future Decentralised structure, empowered second line of leadership High dependency on limited donors for funding Diversiﬁcation of the funding strategies and approaches Credibility of the data and insights, highly transparent, good inroad within the policy circle Open and transparent about the limitation as an entity Alignment of long-term ideas and objectives, strong value proposition More ground level implementation and impacts 9.7 Quality of research and sectoral outputs Key Positives Opportunities to improve Quality of convenings, events and outreach are highly appreciated within the sector Peer-reviewed pieces of evidence of high-quality available as a sectoral asset and enabling the policy ecosystem to adopt and decide Highly competent human capital: ability to perform multi-faceted research in dynamic ecosystems Young, vibrant, and dynamic set of researchers in a platform enabling them to perceive futuristic and sector-shaping research Commendable HR processes supporting competent talent acquisition consistently Quality of outputs, data visualisations and knowledge products Ability to conceive complex research hypotheses, strong analytical competencies strengthening the research ecosystem Members of the team are empowered with decentralised decision-making power and assist Dr Arunabha holds the key to entrepreneurial leadership capital and is still, the face of many relationships Researchers are fatigued in programmes cause of many other involvements Communication teams in some instances have been seen as misaligned with the programme during convenings and events 52 --- Page 54 --- the programmes and initiatives. While quality measurement is very subjective, some key characteristics highlighted by donors include - ● Quality and competency of researchers. ● Infrastructure for developing and conducting complex research designs. ● Quality control and assurance systems, including peer-review publications. ● Quality of the evidence to inﬂuence decision-makers, policymakers etc., From the donor’s perspective, the study observed dichotomised opinions on the peer-reviewed publications. Close to 50% donors of the donors who responded, believed that peer-review publications were the most objective way to measure the quality of research, in contrast, others believed that developing workable models to demonstrate or scale from the evidence generated was more important than research publications. Donor agencies praised The Council for the quality of its convenings and its ability to convene key sectoral stakeholders who could consume the evidence to take forward as action, models to demonstrate and scale, and so on. More internal deliberations, learning seminars, and open discussions between peers in the think tank space, according to donor suggestions, can elevate the discussion during convenings and help to create an active evidence exchange network to beneﬁt the sector and the research ecosystem. 100% of the donors responding in the study perceived a high quality in the Councils&amp;#x27; research outputs, presentations (notably visualisations), and network connection (ability to convene adept government stakeholders etc.). Donors attributed The Council&amp;#x27;s quality function to its agile, young, and vibrant group of researchers, who had the competencies to ideate and conceive complex and sector-aware designs. Bright and Intellectual Human Capital The donor community regarded The Council’s competencies and human capital as among the best in the industry. Dr Arunabha is revered for having created a great platform for young, competent researchers with good analytical and research skills, aiding in creating a reputable brand value for The Council over the last decade. The donors commonly believed that it is this exceptional leadership ability that has resulted in the organisation&amp;#x27;s rapid growth in a brief period. Working with local and national governments, as well as effectively navigating geopolitical inﬂuences, are traits that are being institutionalised. The staff of the institution are mirroring the footsteps of their leader, exhibiting the potential to follow the same enterprising competency. In some instances, team members have displayed a high degree of decentralisation in making decisions at the programmatic level to accelerate the outputs and outcomes. More than 50% of the donors responded that the character traits are individual-centric, and whether conscious efforts are made to institutionalise the behaviour is something for The Council to reﬂect on. Donors have emphasised the importance of developing a second line of leadership. 53 --- Page 55 --- Being a young organisation is a clear strength which has enabled The Council to focus on ideation and futuristic thought leadership. This has been reﬂected on occasions such as proposing a study, shaping sectoral discussions during convenings etc. Over the past decade, being novel, unique, and futuristic has reﬂected in the growth and development of the institution. During meetings, Dr Arunabha interfaces with key stakeholder groups. While putting out the outreach products, there is a diversity of voices other than leaders, which is concentrated on a few core members. To remain an effective think tank in this sector, The Council must invest in human capital and its people, as well as institutionalise aspects like advocacy and dissemination. The human capital in the organisation was reported to be well-empowered, energetic, and displayed commendable analytical competencies and diversity, which is much needed in the sector. The approach to talent acquisition and the efforts of the human resources division were praised, and the impact was felt during the donor engagement. There were a few noteworthy challenges highlighted by a couple of donors. In certain contexts, there were gaps and a lack of clarity on people’s designation and their roles. Two donors highlighted that the programme teams were noticeably stretched across multiple projects, which resulted in challenging engagement, and consequently over-burdened with work, displayed fatigue. Another instance highlighted by a couple of donors pointed toward the internal team cohesion and coordination. During the meetings, donors highlighted instances where a noticeable disconnect was observed between the team members. The root cause of the dissonance arose due to a lack of alignment between the programme and the communications team. The core programmatic team was perceived to be more in control of the operations at the programme level. However, the effectiveness of the communications team during convenings and events was perceived as unsynchronous with the donor’s expectations. Four of the donors interviewed echoed a similar point of view. Due to a lack of involvement in the project from the start, the communications team were not intimately familiar with the content. As a result, it became difﬁcult because their content felt disconnected and caused misalignment during the event. Sectoral asset creation and effective advocacy Diverse opinions were presented by the donors on how they perceived The Council’s quality of outputs and the strategy towards the evidence generation and outreach process. Factoring diversity of methods and depth of research, most donors highlighted that The Council is extremely effective in communicating its high-quality research. The quality of products, dissemination of the insights and the overall outreach strategy has been effective, and a ﬁne balance exists as they publish a portfolio of research content. Overall, on the advocacy front, donors appreciated the active engagement in decision-making and policy-making processes at the local and national levels. Respondents presented examples 54 --- Page 56 --- of how they viewed the communications strategy and shared their experiences. A few examples cited by the donors in terms of sector-deﬁning work done by The Council were ● Powering Livelihoods Globally Through Clean Energy ● Collaborative R&amp;amp;D for Sustainable Cooling in India ● Peaking and Net-Zero for India’s Energy Sector CO 2 Emissions ● Acting on Many Fronts: Incentives and Regulations to Phase-down HFCs in India ● How Is India Using its Solar Pumps for Irrigation? ● What On Earth! ™ The Council has effectively published its reports with valuable content rather than focusing on pure numbers. If you introspect on the content they generate, it is beneﬁcial, credible, and understandable rather than information noise. For instance, look at their website, it is effective, accessible, and a well-organised platform disseminating their reports and available to even the public. The quality of presentations and study outputs, the content, analytical synthesis, sense-making of the data, interpretation, narrative building, and visualisations are perceived to be remarkably high quality. The ﬁnal report or the convening provides a crisp, precise closure to the engagement and often ends as a sectoral asset. This was the dominant narrative of nearly 80% of the donors. However, a single donor shared how communication with The Council had been particularly difﬁcult. Getting a streamlined product out with multiple iterations and multiple insights has been perceived as a challenge. Speciﬁcally, getting feedback on the advocacy pieces and the process of aggregating and communicating the changes before arriving at the ﬁnal output was a haphazard experience. The inputs from the research team were useful but came very delayed. Lots of effort and mind space was spent on the process; however, the ﬁnal output was satisfactory. A lot of back-and-forth effort was required to get feedback from The Council on the advocacy products. We did not observe any structure or set processes during this exchange, like inserting comments, lack of constructive critiques, too many people commenting on a single draft etc. Through the lens of potential, the donors feel The Council seems ahead of the curve compared to other think tanks in India in terms of competencies and capacities to create knowledge outputs, policy convenings. However, few donors felt that The Council had not capitalised on this potential through their marketing, communications, and PR teams. This is an avenue where The Council could speciﬁcally re-strategies, improvise and learn from the global research think tanks, especially since the ambition is to engage with key decision-makers in the global context and transition to working towards international policy making. Key Takeaways From the insights developed through the discussion with the donors, the recommendations converge to 55 --- Page 57 --- ● Building institutionalised processes to capacitate leadership and entrepreneurial capital across the second line of senior researchers. ● Strengthening the talent acquisition process to: o hire for diverse competencies required for the global and national/subnational expansion agenda, o expand beyond the value chain of research and advocacy, i.e., policy implementation, incubations, scaling up solutions etc., ● Attracting and retaining talented human capital o Support for recruitment, training, and capacity development support. o Creating a better working environment, employee retention, staff morale etc. (A career-building, training, and learning platform for the young and vibrant team) 9.8 Transition towards institution and ecosystem-level sustainability The organic and intuitive development of think tanks is highly dependent on capitalising on the institutional development modalities to transition towards sustainability at the institution and ecosystem levels. Expert opinions and donor perceptions suggest that institution development funds and the availability of ﬂexible grants have aided think tanks in developing diverse endogenous institutional capacity and strategically driven organisational development. The overarching impact of think tanks and the legacy The Council should focus on for the vision 2030 henceforth could be summarised through the following institutional levers, i.e., 1. Institutional capacity development and strategic thought leadership excellence. 2. Strengthening leadership and governance mechanisms through building a second line of leadership. 3. Contributing to (and especially ‘sector shaping’ work towards) stronger networks, improved capacities, and commitments to engage with the policy community. 4. More concerted reﬂection and action on the ‘service functions’, ‘value propositions’ and ‘business models’ that hedge and sustain these achievements. 5. Creation of global, national, sub-national and regional networks of think tanks and thought leaders to collaborate in sectoral benchmarking exercises, exchange of knowledge and experiences, dissemination of global and local demonstrated good practices, etc. 6. Developing a diverse portfolio of ﬁssile material, i.e., a well-functioning combination of human, intellectual, resource, social, institutional, and reputational capital to ensure the institution&amp;#x27;s long-term viability. The importance of institutional leadership succession For an intensive and integrated focus on longer-term institutional strength, a signiﬁcant focus by The Council on governance and leadership and on leadership planning is critical. Donors perceived that generic operational and functional strengths and strategic engagement strategies in silos possess an immense risk. Suppose the key account managers are not 56 --- Page 58 --- succeeded by a second line of leadership to take the engagement and programmes forward. In that case, the wealth of programmes, initiatives and networks created will become ineffective over the long term. The Council has a talented group of young researchers, the dialogues between the donors and The Council were driven by their leaders and primarily focused on the organisation&amp;#x27;s leadership. In high churn areas, like pushing deliverables or larger convenings, the availability of highly effective resources and stafﬁng constraints have been starkly visible. Stressing the need to build a second line of leadership and capacity, some donors perceived that Dr Arunabha is in a situation where he has to do most of the heavy lifting on account of a lack of resources and capacities. The Council is focused on a single leader, and therefore, the survival of the organisation will become challenging. Leadership duties should be shared among all members. A couple of donors highlighted the struggle and dependencies across other think tanks in the same sector, such as TERI, DA etc., when it comes to leadership and succession planning. Despite developing an idea into a dynamic and ﬁnancially sound think tank on the global stage, the institutions suffered massive strategic shifts because of a lack of succession planning. It would be a great model for The Council to get ahead of the curve. I remember this was some couple of years ago. A perceived successor to Dr Arunabha Ghosh had quit the organisation; it was in immediate chaos. In certain aspects, they were never able to bridge the gap left by the person’s exit. Certain members of The Council should be considered as the second line of leaders in terms of networking with the government and other agencies, and these functions should not be driven only by Dr Arunabha. 50% of the donors who responded strongly expressed concern on account of the lack of a second line of leadership. They viewed it as a major barrier to achieving institutional sustainability and a potential risk for The Council to grow and expand. While in terms of The Council’s research, they ﬁnd strong institutional leadership, in partnerships, and they recognise the need for a massive improvement in leadership building, besides Dr Arunabha and a few key leaders. Fine-tuning the ecosystem levers Donors highlighted that the role of think tanks is to provide thought leadership support to the funding institutions in terms of shaping up their strategy to achieve their mission. A think tank&amp;#x27;s afﬁliation is to bridge the intentional or strategic gap between the approaches of multiple donors in the sector and guide them to focus on sectoral needs and trends to achieve the larger intended vision of the respective philanthropy or foundation, bringing them closer together in the sectoral space. 57 --- Page 59 --- Wherever required, the expectation from the engaging think tank is to suggest, course-correct and replicate their ﬂagship programmes and assist in ideating towards emerging sectoral trends and gaps in the sector to maximise and accelerate impact. This is an aspect in which The Council was perceived to be strategic and consistent by some of the donors. There were suggestions that The Council widen the current engagement levers beyond evidence generation, policy formulation, advocacy, dissemination, and outreach. Four of the key donors who rank high in terms of the criteria deﬁned earlier perceived that The Council does possess the potential and social capital to take forward their action research by creating implementation designs, demonstrations, models, and scale building by working with implementation organisations. They believe this is a critical sectoral need, is a huge gap with few visible case stories . Think Tanks are expected to provide thought leadership to key decision-makers, translate great ideas into action, ensure uptake of ideas by decision-makers, and lead key debate amongst civil societies. Bringing a diverse set of stakeholders into a single page and developing consensus is a key part of the Think Tanks role, and The Council must reﬂect on how far a think tank assumes this role in their engagements and values. 58 --- Page 60 --- 10 Key perceptions mapped from the donors (Cohort 2) A total of 8 potential investors that included private equity investors/incubators and philanthropies/HNIs were interviewed as part of Cohort 2. This section reports their perceptions and opinions. 10.1 Awareness and perception of The Council Majority of the investors in Cohort 2 are aware of The Council and the think tank’s work. The donors working exclusively in the private equity or niche domains were unaware of The Council. Amongst the Cohort 2 interviewees who have a presence in the climate change domain, the awareness of The Council, their sectoral position, and the understanding of the services offered were noticeable. In a few cases, there was a misconception regarding the various value propositions the institution offered. Despite the high awareness, only 2-3 donors had in-depth knowledge about The Council’s impact or the potential for impact. We are aware of the work being done by The Council, we have funded think tanks in the past, and we will come to them. As of now, we are still exploring this space and eventually will get to them 10.2 Prior work with think tanks/research The impact investing ecosystem has investors with two dominating investment behaviours, i.e., ● Investors who prioritise ﬁnancial returns over impact created ● Those who look for a high social impact as a return on investments. Cohort 2 included both donor typologies with clear patterns coming out on how value propositions such as policy research or evidence generation were perceived. The donors siding towards the ﬁnancial return end of the spectrum had marginal interactions with think tanks, let alone funding one. Market-led business models drove their investment philosophy, and proﬁt-driven products, solutions and social returns were perceived as an add-on. Organisations from the private equity space, along with a few NBFCs operating in the domain of impact investing had a similar orientation. We do not fund research at this point; however, we try to inﬂuence people who can fund research to move funding into areas that require them. We do not see a lot of business cases for a research think tank which can be sustainable. However, we see opportunities in few core issues in climate, such as predictive modelling, which can predict extreme climate events The organisations and investors that focus on social return on investments perceived clear beneﬁts in working with the think tanks and other research organisations. Policy-led transformation and evidence-based solutions were clearly on their radar for investments, and they also had a demonstrable history of collaborating with research institutions. A few investors also walked through robust frameworks they used to evaluate think tanks and other research organisations before partnering and during investments. 59 --- Page 61 --- To summarise, the perception of research and think tanks as an avenue for investment varies signiﬁcantly depending on the trend in the sector, the portfolio of the donor, and the attitude of the donor in eliciting a clear return (ﬁnancial or social) on the investment, despite operating in the impact investing ecosystem. 10.3 Partnerships and collaboration Partnerships and collaboration were areas of signiﬁcant discussions with Cohort 2 donors. The only exception was the private equity investors, whose focus was centred around individual business models of the investors and the sustenance of the investment. Most of the donors in Cohort 2 preferred an investment that would be synergistic with their existing portfolio, which indicates, ● Expectations of a high degree of collaboration ● Engaging in multiple investments under the portfolio. A few donors had clear criteria deﬁned for investing, which emerged from the experiences in the current portfolio as speciﬁc outcomes and impact indicators of success. The ability of the potential investee to collaborate was dependent on their composite scoring across the indicators. It is important for any organisation we invest in to ﬁt into our larger strategic goals; it should work well within our existing portfolio. The donors also clearly shared opinions that, to move the needle in the sector signiﬁcantly, multiple sets of competencies and expertise are required, which would be impossible for a single organisation or partner to exhibit. 10.4 Motivations for investing in the social impact space While the social impact is one of the common themes amongst all Cohort 2 participants, their deﬁnition of Impact varied quite a bit. Few donors were extremely ambitious and would only consider transformations in the sector as impact (changes in policy, adoption of stakeholders at scale, policy implementation at scale etc.), unlike the conventional perception of measuring impact throughout the value chain of change. Typically, the new-age philanthropic donors mentioned that they do not want to be bound by conventional views on how philanthropy operates. We are not looking at numbers alone; we want to create a dent in this space. Change perspectives around climate; we are audacious in terms of how unique we are; we want to tackle issues which others are not seeing. We are not risk averse; we are not looking at past experiences. Interestingly, all the new-age philanthropic donors in Cohort 2 indicated their pathway to impact is unique. This is directly in contrast to the rest of the donors in the Cohort, who perceived impact through the lens of sustainable business models. These donors believed that while investing in non-proﬁts is crucial to unlocking impact, there needs to be a sustainable business model that goes hand in hand with the same. 60 --- Page 62 --- 10.5 Interpretations from the discussions While the Cohort 2 shortlisting, the donors&amp;#x27; proﬁles drawn were private equity investors/incubators or philanthropies/HNIs, post-synthesis three typologies of funding institutions and mechanisms emerged. Their deﬁning characteristics are detailed in this section. New age philanthropies Proﬁle of the investors This group consists of investing organisations driven by high-net-worth individuals. This includes organisations such as Rohini Nilekani philanthropies, Rainmatter Foundation, Pratiksha Trust etc. Most of these organisations are still in their early stages where they are quite experimental in their approach to investing. Portfolio and Focus areas The portfolio of these investors is quite varied. The focus areas also vary signiﬁcantly, mostly driven by individual interests which can be illustrated with the case of Pratiksha Trust investing in Brain, Computation, and Data which stems a lot from the personal interests of their largest backer Kris Gopalakrishnan. However, a key point to note is that innovation and technology are common themes that most of these investors focus on. The nexus of domains is also a key feature of these investments. During the interviews, most investors in this category stressed that organisations working on issues that cut across domains are preferred. Type of investments While there are no limitations to the type of investments the new age philanthropies can make from a legal point of view, grant-based models dominate. Grants give them ﬂexibility, as seen in the case of Rainmatter capital which has a dedicated fund for organisational grants, which allows grantees to experiment a lot more than output/outcome-based grants which typically dominate this space, at least from an Indian context. Most of the investments made are multi-year, unrestricted and not tied to speciﬁc outcomes. These organisations also usually have dedicated units which focus exclusively on equity investments where along with impact, proﬁtability becomes a key investment criterion. Approach to investments The approach to investments by new age philanthropists are extremely individualised. While broad sets of guidelines are deﬁned, there is ample ﬂexibility available. There is a lot of emphasis on leadership and people, which was evident from the conversations with these investors. A clear focus on leadership rather than the process was observed. A trust-based approach to investment is observed where the investment is based on the organisation’s vision rather than speciﬁc outcomes. Expectations from the investments Since the new age investments are long-term and do not focus on speciﬁc outcomes, the key expectations from the investment are at the sectoral level regarding innovation or an idea that 61 --- Page 63 --- moves the needle forward in the sector and transforms the sector. Scale is also key for these investments, particularly the technology-based investments where the expectation is to leverage technology to achieve impact at scale. There are also limited reporting requirements, with most investors expecting an update once a quarter. Impact Investors Proﬁle of the investors The impact investor group, such as Omidyar Network and Social Alpha, invests in organisations that operate in both the start-up and the non-proﬁt space. Most of these organisations have been around for over a decade and have a more standard approach to investing. Portfolio and Focus areas The portfolio of the impact investors is predominantly early-stage companies and, in some cases, few non-proﬁts. The focus areas are clearly deﬁned as part of the larger strategy and are decided based on the larger philosophy of the investor. Some of the investors in this group were not investing in organisations working on climate change as they felt sustainable business models are yet to emerge in this space. While they carry non-proﬁt organisations in their portfolios, there is a clear ‘ﬁt’ to the portfolio in terms of alignment to the larger goals of the portfolio. Type of investments Majority of the investments are equity-based to for-proﬁt companies. However, there is a sizable portion of non-proﬁt organisations in the portfolio where the investment is a grant. For equity investment, the horizon is between 5 to 7 years which is the case for most investments in early-stage companies. For non-proﬁts, the period of investments varies based on whether the investment is made on a project basis or for a programme. Approach to investments The way these investors approach their investments is extremely organised, with well-deﬁned frameworks that guide the investment strategies. There is a clear demarcation between direct impact vis-a-vis sectoral impact, with strategies for both outlined clearly. The areas of investments are distilled from the larger goals of the organisation and hence have limited scope to be ﬂexible. Most of the organisations in this group have a 1–3-year strategy for their investments locked in, and in that period, the focus remains only on the execution of the strategy. The companies/organisations are evaluated on speciﬁc metrics, which revolve around the ﬁt to the portfolio, leadership, risks, ﬁnancial metrics (in the case of for-proﬁts), reach and policy impact (in the case of non-proﬁts). Expectations from the investments The investments are focussed on speciﬁc outcomes. The key expectations from the investment are clearly deﬁned right at the start. For non-proﬁts, expectations are further customised based on the kind of impact they are envisioned to create such as direct and sectoral impacts. To illustrate using an example, Omidyar Network has ﬁve distinct levels of outcome deﬁned 62 --- Page 64 --- speciﬁcally for organisations working on research and policy. At the highest levels, these would involve achieving a change in basic assumptions in the sector via a transformational policy that cuts across sectors and geographies. There is a clear classiﬁcation of non-proﬁts based on the impact achieved and through our interactions with multiple investors in this space, The Council would rank at the highest levels in terms of impact. Private Equity and Debt Proﬁle of the investors The private equity and debt group comprises investing organisations that typically operate in the start-up space, such as Aavishkaar capital, Yunus Social Business (YSB), Caspian Impact etc. While these investors categorise themselves as impact investors, they focus on ﬁnancial returns. Some of these investors are in the venture debt space as well, where the ownership of the investees is not diluted to raise capital. Portfolio and Focus areas The portfolios in the private equity and debt space are diverse, but within the organisation, it is quite focused. Most of the portfolio is dominated by for-proﬁt companies. There are few instances of funding to non-proﬁts, such as YSB which is open to funding non-proﬁt organisations provided a sustainable revenue stream is available. An example of this would be non-proﬁts engaging in training/capacity building of youth for a fee; YSB is open to funding the capital expenditure of such organisations so that they can set up operations. Climate is a clear focus area for these investors. However, investors in the private equity and debt space do not support multi-sectoral funding. Type of investments Most of the private equity and debt investments are equity-based, with few companies offering debt in the form of quasi-equity. Equity investments are usually for a horizon of 10-12 years, considering the organisations are looking at the social and ﬁnancial returns. With debt, the horizon is usually under three years. The investments are earmarked for speciﬁc projects/activities with regular reporting requirements. Approach to investments As mentioned above, the sustainability of cash ﬂows is a key metric to evaluate organisations for investors in this space. Even in the case of non-proﬁt organisations that have revenue streams, managing cash ﬂows is expected. For-proﬁt organisations are evaluated similarly to those operating in the non-impact space, with robust cash-to-cash cycles and lower leverage than industry standards and other ﬁnancial metrics. Expectations from the investments The investments are expected to generate returns from a ﬁnancial point of view; in a few cases, these returns are slightly lower than the industry average, but a decent ﬁnancial return is non-negotiable. Social returns are not necessarily measured robustly post the investment, but the potential impact the organisation can create is evaluated and used as a decision point to 63 --- Page 65 --- invest. A few investors we spoke to as part of the study indicated that while they have a mandate to invest in ﬁrms that create a positive social or environmental impact, they are not necessarily mission-driven organisations and have clear ﬁnancial goals. A donor’s voice Context A social change venture investor working towards creating structural changes that will fundamentally shift the systems that govern our daily lives, having versatile experience in the space of business and technology. By their hybrid governance structure and strategic intent, the social change venture investor is open to funding both for-proﬁt and non-proﬁt organisations. Their guiding principle is that social change could be accelerated through impact-driven change makers in the development sector. Strategically the investor ﬁrm takes decisions on a 5-year timeline, and they fund an array of sectors such as education, digital and ﬁnancial inclusion, technological interventions etc. While Climate Action is not at the forefront of the previous ﬁve-year strategy, there is a high likelihood of climate being a focus in the strategy for the next 5 years. Investor perspective The investor prioritises impact and returns on the same continuum and not as opposing forces. The investor has built a robust rubric and a structured approach to their investments and measures the effectiveness of the investment and the impact created by the investment. Each step of the process is very well articulated and documented in the form of frameworks, results metrics, and guiding tools. Speciﬁcally, when it comes to measuring the impact, a robust framework is adopted, which goes into great depth in terms of whether the impact is directly reaching the communities, what is the factoring for attribution and contribution, whether the impact is sector-speciﬁc etc. Based on the impact type, the investment approach is further customised. There is a precise classiﬁcation of investees in terms of impact, correlation with the capital deployed and an accountability framework. From The Councils point of view, policy impact is a clear area of focus for the investor. As mentioned earlier, this is further broken down into a detailed framework on how policy impact is envisioned. This can be from a focus audience&amp;#x27;s point of view, impact or the medium. For The Council to be a key partner for the investor, there must be alignment at multiple levels as follows 1. Focus area convergence (such as climate change, education etc.), 2. Impact framework (in terms of where The Council would ﬁt) 3. Level of impact envisioned Perception of The Council The investor is aware of the work that has been done by The Council. When asked to locate The Council on their framework of impact, the response was as follows. 64 --- Page 66 --- The Council will be an impact star (highest categorisation in terms of impact) in our framework; they are very high in terms of sectoral impact created; this would involve achieving a paradigm shift in the sector via a transformational policy that cuts across sectors and geographies Key takeaways Portfolio and Focus areas Type of investments Approaches to investments Expectations from the investments Early-stage for-proﬁt companies Equity Highly structured approach Clearly deﬁned outcomes Not for proﬁts Grants Flowing top-down from the larger strategy (5-year cycles) Strategic alignment to the more extensive portfolio of the investor Limited ﬂexibility Measurable outcomes 10.6 Implications for The Council in terms of fundraising strategy Figure 7. Different types of investors ﬁt into the requirements of The Council summarises the diverse types of investors, with a discussion on their ﬁt into the requirements of The Council. Figure 7. Different types of investors ﬁt into the requirements of The Council The New age philanthropies ﬁt in with the current set-up of The Council and ﬁt in well with the larger goals of The Council in the next decade, which is to ● Become a world-class institution in data, outreach, and analysis of global signiﬁcance with a focus on impact at scale, 65 --- Page 67 --- ● Move sustainability from the “Margin” to “Mainstream” by working across the themes of policy, technology, ﬁnance, and behaviour to move from a policy advisory to a mainstream economy. ● Invest in the institutional development of The Council and build institutional capacities of the organisation. All these criteria are met by this group of investors, who are focused on investing in institutions such as The Council, which works at the nexus of domains and has great leadership, which The Council boasts of as well. These investors are based out of India, which reduces the risks associated with potential changes in the FCRA laws. The Impact investors category ﬁts well in terms of the vision of the investors and types of investments made, however, the challenge would be the investment approach of these investors, and the expectations they hold. Since these investors follow an extremely structured approach to investing, The Council will have to improve its engagement mechanisms on building partnerships and engagement. In terms of expectations as well, this category of investors looks for clearly deﬁned outcomes and robust ways to establish contribution. The limitation of engaging with this set of investors is the lack of ﬂexibility. Lastly, Private Equity and Debt occupy an important space in the climate change domain with a lot of investments, particularly in the space of sustainable mobility and agriculture-climate nexus. However, they do not ﬁt into the larger vision The Council has for the next decade as such funding sources would require The Council to pivot to a for-proﬁt enterprise with a focus on particular areas of climate change, going against the more important Council goal to work in the nexus of sectors. 66 --- Page 68 --- 11 Annexures 11.1 Engagement Sustainability Index, USAID 1. Legal Environment: Factors shaping the legal environment; ease of registration; legal rights and conditions; and the degree to which laws and regulations regarding taxation, procurement etc. 2. Organisational Capacity: Sector’s ability to engage in constituency building and strategic planning, as well as internal management and stafﬁng practices within the institution etc. 3. Financial Viability : Factors inﬂuencing the ﬁnancial viability of the institution include the state of the economy, the extent to which fundraising, independence etc. are being nurtured in the research and culture etc. 4.

Financial Management: Managing the stream of costs and revenues; costs encompass the ﬁnancial support needed to perform all the elements of a think tank’s business 67 --- Page 69 --- model, such as the core activities, stafﬁng, etc., and revenues refer to income because of products’ sale. 8. Communication Strategy: Plan, programme, and activities designed by think tanks to reach their donors, beneﬁciaries, and other stakeholders 11.3 Funding Landscape Building on the literature review undertaken, the study identiﬁed that there was an increase in the ﬁnancing for renewables , a surge in the ﬂows toward low-carbon transport , a strong upwards trend in public ﬁnancing for adaptation , and early signs of mainstreaming across a larger set of private ﬁnancing institutions. The landscape of Sustainable development investments in India Sustainable development investment space in India takes place across diverse avenues, and the dominant routes are the government investments, global foundations and foundations and CSR arms of Indian corporations. The funding for sustainable development in the Indian landscape as of 2020 is at USD 8.13 Billion. Sustainable ﬁnance is having a larger pie of attributing USD 7.2 Billion, Individual philanthropic contributions for sustainable development of USD 480 Million and CSR contributions for sustainable development would be USD 450 Million. Investment Lens by Impact Philanthropists, CSR, and Corporate Foundations Looking at the above graph, the sustainable development investments by family philanthropists, have a contribution of 12% of the overall investments. Azim Premji Foundation (APF) is one of the highest funded philanthropies, it works with the principle of addressing the challenges of vulnerable communities. APF funds only the environmental initiatives in addressing the challenges of small marginal and landless farmers and pastoral and tribal communities. 68 --- Page 70 --- Another major philanthropy is Rohini Nilekani Foundation, it funds institutions Arghyam, Ekstep and Pratham, whereas Arghyam is the only organisation that directly works on environmental initiatives focused on promoting clean drinking water and water conservation initiatives. As shown in the above graph, the potential for research and development for sustainable investment with family philanthropy is seen through the lenses of vulnerable populations resolving their access to energy, meeting their livelihood needs and water conservation practices. The statistics pu t out by Foundational Maps by Candid 21 provided us with a glimpse of the ﬂow of funds across various environmental sectors in India. Program funding vs Institutional funding by CSR arms and domestic corporations CSR funding in the Indian landscape was USD 2.5-3 billion (INR 167-201 billion) from around 16,000 eligible companies, However, the strategic alignment of CSR investments is limited to the following three key aspects. ● CSR funds need to be complying to CSR rules and activities prescribed by Schedule 7-Companies Act (Contribution to PM CARES/PM Relief fund, Swachh Bharat, Promoting education, healthcare, skill development among differently abled, vulnerable populations, protection of national heritage, environmental sustainability, and others) ● Designing and delivering programs meeting their proportioned annual budget and highlighting visible outcomes in short gestation ● Post pandemic, the CSR managers are keen to focus on vulnerable populations on livelihoods, healthcare, and access to social protection ﬁnancial services Between 2015 to 2020, the spending from CSR activities is estimated to be INR 79,293 Crores and the environmental sustainability spending is around 8% for environmental sustainability. The average spending on CSR activities per organisation in the last 5 years ranges from INR 65 L to INR 75 L per year. With the new CSR rules, multi-year CSR investments are allowed, and ﬁrms are allowed to set off surplus spending for up to 3 years. Philanthropy in India There is also a clear movement towards a more structured approach with the involvement of a lot more stakeholders. Given the context of the Indian growth story, the nature of philanthropy has changed as follows Move towards bolder issues, and a structured approach to funding There is a clear movement toward a more structured approach with the involvement of a lot more stakeholders. There is a gradual shift towards an outcome-based approach of giving with more niche areas being covered. The below chart details the same. 21 The R&amp;amp;D analysis includes the funding only from the Corporate Giving Program https://maps.foundationcenter.org/home.php 69 --- Page 71 --- Stronger support for the ecosystem There is an increasing trend of new roles and actors entering the philanthropic sector as service providers. The below diagram captures the numerous services and support functions that have emerged in the last decade to support the philanthropic ecosystem. Philanthropic Houses / HNIs / Diaspora-led Funding Key decision areas for donor groups In this section we look at the key decision-making elements that philanthropists, HNIs, and Diaspora-led funders look at across various components and the larger proﬁle of donors and grant-making organisations that suits the requirements of The Council. Motivation for the donor Below are the key decision-making elements for a donor organisation looking from a lens of the primary motivations for the decision to fund. 70 --- Page 72 --- These choices are not exhaustive, there are several other points on which decisions might need to be made, and many more choices available to the donor. The extreme choices discussed and choices available in the continuum of the two extremes are not the only ones available. In the context of the requirements highlighted by The Council, philanthropists, philanthropic houses, HNIs, diaspora-led funders etc. falling under the junction of the below decision choices would ﬁt best. These donors proﬁled since funding out of choice have more ﬂexibility in their approach, with the recent trend of funders taking more ownership of their interventions The Council is well positioned to leverage funding for research and design and not just implementation as is the case with funders who support causes. Sustainability is an overarching theme in all the work The Council undertakes, at times this requires working on complex nexus of sustainability issues, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary hypotheses etc. which might put the research and funding needs at crosshairs with national priorities aimed at economic development and with the key stakeholders, governments, and quasi-governments in the ecosystem, hence a funder who is willing to fund these tough grounds is extremely crucial. The ﬁgure represented below, depicts the key decision points that donors must take on the various methods on how intent gets translated into a strategy and approach to work. To achieve the larger goals of The Council when it comes to the methods of delivering philanthropic intent below is the combination of methods that are required. Transformative funding is key for realising the vision The Council has for 2030, funding causes and work that creates long-term conditions such that the number of people needing curative help decreases. ‘The Councils’ key strength coming from the key discussions has been the young, dynamic, and diverse team. It is important for the potential donors to be comfortable working in this environment that would foster innovative ideas, perspectives, and criticisms. Lastly, it is paramount that the funder is patient with the capital employed and looks at building expertise in the long term. 71 --- Page 73 --- Methods for translating philanthropic intent 72 --- Page 74 --- Core activities By core activities we refer to the actual activities that the strategies translate to. For The Council to make its vision a reality the potential donors, drive focus on funding behavioural change in turn focus on improving the capacities within the organisation. The potential funding approaches are earmarked to building the institutional capacity and institutional development holistically for The Council rather than speciﬁc programs, with a high degree of ﬂexibility. 73 --- Page 75 --- The below table summarises the proﬁle of the philanthropists that ﬁt into the overall vision The Council has. 74 --- Page 76 --- Rohini Nilekani Foundation Philanthropy perspective: The philanthropy is keen to invest in collaborations among institutions, ideas and individuals delivering path-breaking work that promotes a strong samaj with ethical leadership, a sense of urgency and courage to learn. Accordingly, philanthropy believes in and works for the revival of communities and builds capacity to meet their functions and duties towards their progress. They invest in institutions that co-create and enable governance among the community institutions. Funding background: They invested in institutions across Climate and Biodiversity, with a grant of ₹ 14.51 Crores in the ﬁnancial year 2020 to 2021 and ₹ 15.34 Crores in the ﬁnancial year 2020 to 2021. They fund collaboratives, research and data-centric organisations and implementation agencies on sustainable water solutions - Arghyam( ₹ 150 Crores), Climate collaboratives (ICC), ATREE( ₹ 50 Crores), and Biodiversity conservation measures-Elephant habitat protection, Bangalore Environment Trust and many more organisations. 11.4 The tracker Link to the tracker : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13YVBxd5ZaaORruLWTmSpiXSqhHjnuEdgBQ5AF-z 43HM/edit#gid=391092878 11.5 Cohort 2 funding institution rating Organisation Type of Funder (II - Impact Investors NAP - New age philanthropies PED - Private Equity and Debt) Working in the larger theme of sustainabi lity Past instances of funding non-proﬁts in addition to for proﬁt enterprises Fund nexus of sectors, does not focus on single sector like water etc Fund institutiona l developmen t and not just sectoral outcomes CMS Existing Networki ng Potential Composite Score Nilekani philanthropi es NAP 5 5 5 5 4 4.8 Acumen II 5 3 5 3 5 4.2 Rainmatter Capital NAP 4 5 4 5 3 4.2 Yunus Social Business II 5 1 5 4 5 4.0 Tata Social Alfa II 4 4 4 2 5 3.8 Pratiksha Trust-Kris Gopal Krishnan NAP 3 5 3 3 5 3.8 Aavishkar PED 4 3 3 4 5 3.8 75 --- Page 77 --- Omidyar Network II 3 4 3 3 5 3.6 Ennovent II 5 4 3 2 3 3.4 LGTVP Traditional Philanthropy 3 1 4 4 5 3.4 Asha Impact II 3 4 4 2 4 3.4 Dasra II 4 3 3 1 3 2.8 Village Capital PED 4 1 4 3 1 2.6 Sangam Ventures PED 4 2 3 2 2 2.6 Caspian II 3 2 3 2 3 2.6 Climate Angels PED 4 1 3 3 1 2.4 Beyond Capital II 3 1 2 1 5 2.4 CIIE-IIMA II 3 1 4 1 3 2.4 IITM-RTBI Incubator 3 2 2 2 2 2.2 Grassroots Business Fund II 3 1 3 2 1 2.0 Ankur Capital PED 2 1 3 1 2 1.8 Menterra II 1 2 1 1 4 1.8 Unitus II 2 1 2 2 2 1.8 Aspada PED 3 1 2 1 1 1.6 Lok Capital PED 2 1 1 2 2 1.6 Grey Matters Capital II 1 1 1 2 3 1.6 Ventureast PED 2 2 1 2 1 1.6 Accion II 2 1 1 1 2 1.4 Elevar Equity II 1 1 1 1 1 1.0 * Intellecap was interviewed based on suggestions by Aavishkar post their interview as they saw better ﬁt to The council 76</Content>

Introduction and Background 1.1 About the SMART Program Skills-for-Market (SMART) is the ﬂagship program by Tech Mahindra Foundation (TMF), aiming to build job-ready skills for youth, particularly those from underprivileged backgrounds and those facing additional challenges such as disability, age, and low educational attainment. Aligned with the Skill India Mission, it imparts foundational and job-speciﬁc skills through training programs to improve youth employability across various domains. 85 SMART 1 centers are operationalized through the support of local NGOs, which have a strong community base in their respective cities. These include SMART+ centers that cater to youth with disabilities and SMART-T centers that speciﬁcally provide technical skills to bridge the demand gap for technical manpower. In addition, TMF operates 12 SMART academies offering 35 high-quality vocational training diplomas and courses across three industries: healthcare, logistics, and digital technologies. These centers are located in 12 cities 2 (tier-1 and tier-2) across different regions of the country. The program is dedicated to contributing to women&amp;#x27;s empowerment by improving their employability and inclusion by ensuring that 50% of its participants are women, speciﬁcally targeting those who face more barriers to participating in the labor force, such as disabilities, low educational attainment, restrictions on obtaining higher education, and employment gaps due to age or life events (such as marriage and childbirth). SMART has successfully trained over 1.6 lakh youth and every year approximately 22,000 youth are trained, out of which 50% are women. 1.2 Role of CMS In alignment and response to the above, there is a requirement to conduct study with the objective to evaluate the quantitative as well as qualitative impact of the program on women participants across the centres and academies. With commitment to the gender-inclusive and gender-responsive evaluation design , CMS has proposed a comprehensive approach for the study detailed section 3 onwards. Our commitment to inclusive methodologies, gender-responsive research, and rigorous quality control positions us as a trusted partner in advancing female labor force, gender equality and empowerment within the scope of the SMART project. 1.3 Objective of the Assessment The study aims to assess the level of change in the employability, ﬁnancial security and independence of women participants who have completed the course in the last three years 2 Chandigarh and Mohali are considered as the same city. Others like East Delhi, and New Delhi have been combined under Delhi 1 As per the cleaned MIS data shared by TMF. The current status of engagement with all partners is being veriﬁed by the programme team, and will reﬂect in the ﬁnal sample selection Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The study will assess the overall impact of the programme in the larger empowerment context using the OECD-DAC criteria 3 o f Relevance, Effectiveness, Efﬁciency, Inclusion, Impact, Sustainability, and Coherence . The detailed questions can be found in the proposal and in annexure I Based on our understanding of the scope of work, the proposed approach, methodology and work plan to answer the questions are detailed in the subsequent sections. 2. Literature review 2.1 Deﬁnition of Women Empowerment Women empowerment has been a wide subject of study and various studies have given different perspectives to the deﬁnition of women empowerment. As per the UNESCWA ( United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ) , Women empowerment is the process by which women become aware of gender-based unequal power relationships and acquire a greater voice in which to speak out against the inequality found in the home, workplace, and community. It involves women taking control over their lives: setting their own agendas, gaining skills, solving problems, and developing self-reliance 4 . It encompasses facilitation of economic, social, psychological and political empowerment of women and girls to promote women’s economic independence, improve relationships and promote equitable gender power relations within households, communities and society 5 . Women&amp;#x27;s empowerment is about the process by which those who have been denied the ability to make strategic life choices acquire such an ability. The process through which individuals gain the ability to make choices and transform these choices into desired actions and outcomes. For women, this involves overcoming barriers imposed by societal norms, economic constraints, and patriarchal systems (Kabeer, Naila). One of the perspectives of women’s empowerment is to promote the equal position of women in the world of work, and to further that aim at one or more levels by: (a) Promoting capacity building of women to enable them to participate equally in all societal activities and decision-making at all levels; (b) Promoting equal access to and control over resources and the beneﬁts of productive, reproductive, and community activities by afﬁrmative action for women; (c) Working to achieve equality and safe and respectful working conditions; (d) Promoting and strengthening the capacity of women’s/ development organisations to act in favour of women’s empowerment and gender equality; (e) Promoting changes in the socio-economic conditions in society that often subordinate women to men such as laws, 5 Strategy Summary: Empowerment of Women 4 Women’s empowerment - United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia 3 https://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/revised-evaluation-criteria-dec-2019.pdf Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

It is a process of change by which those who have been denied the ability to make strategic life choices acquire this ability 6 . It is enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 5. Empowerment happens by removing constraints that impede women’s and girls’ ability to determine and realize their goals. These constraints can be classiﬁed into three pillars: ● Constraints in Agency – the capacity for goal-setting and follow-through, indicative of their level of self-efﬁcacy and self-esteem. ● Constraints in Resources – the inputs (such as capital, assets, tools, and information) that individuals have at their disposal to enable decision-making and actions to achieve their goals. ● Context/ecosystem – an enabling environment for equitable decision-making, including institutions and social arrangements. Addressing constraints across these pillars can empower women to realize speciﬁc achievements, leading to gender equality. 2.2 Women Empowerment and Female Participation in the Workforce Female Participation in the workforce plays a pivotal role in achieving women&amp;#x27;s empowerment. By engaging in economic activities, women gain ﬁnancial independence, decision-making power, and societal recognition, which collectively contribute to their empowerment and the overall development of societies. F emale labour force participation rate (FLPR) is a driver of growth and therefore, participation rates indicate the potential for a country to grow more rapidly. However, the relationship between women’s engagement in the labour market and broader development outcomes is complex 7 . The participation of women in the labour force varies considerably across developing countries and emerging economies, far more than in the case of men. In the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, less than one-third of women of working-age participate, while the proportion reaches around two-thirds in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This variation is driven by a wide variety of economic and social factors including economic growth, increasing educational attainment, falling fertility rates and social norms. Besides labour market gender gaps are more pronounced in developing countries, and disparity is highest in South Asian countries The participation of women in the labour market are primarily driven by various factors, viz., economic development, education levels, fertility rates, access to childcare and other supportive services and, ultimately, the cultural and normative context of society and social norms. These factors react as the “Push and Pull factors” for female participation in employment. However the rapid economic growth, rising education, and declining fertility, results in increasing women participation in the labour force but women face barriers in accessing economic opportunities.

FLPR is a multidimensional agglomeration of structural and socioeconomic factors. Over the years, it has shown an increasing trend. Encouraging and welcoming female higher participation in the labour force is vital for economic growth. The latest Report of Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2021-22 is evident of increased FLPR in India. Though it is lower than the male, it is signiﬁcantly increasing over the years and at present, around one third of women have joined the labour force. It is evident from from the data in the ﬁgure given below that out of the total women, who are outside the labour force, around 44.5% women were not in the labour force due to “Child care/personal commitments in home making” and 33.6% women want to continue their study instead of joining the labour force. Around 3.4% women were outside the labour force due to “social reasons”. The data in the below ﬁgure represents Indian females of age group 15-59 years. Figure : Reasons reported by females (in %) for not being in labour force The female workforce is skewed towards “Self-employment” followed by “casual labour”. In India, out of the total females 19.7% females are self-employed, 6.8% are engaged as “casual labour” and 5.3% are “Regular wage/salaried employees”. 9 Female Labour Utilisation in India 8 Reshaping Norms: A New Way Forward Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

It provides occupation speciﬁc knowledge and job related skills to participants. It is closely related with economic growth and is capable of creating employment for their income generation. Vocational and technical training are designed to develop the skills, ability and knowledge necessary for employment, income support and development of women empowerment and provide an opportunity to females for climbing on a social ladder of faster development. The participation rate of male and female in various such programmes are also affected by the traditional patterns of occupational segregation. Textiles and handlooms, apparels is the most prevalent ﬁeld of training among Indian rural females followed by the IT-ITeS. Around 30.1% of total Indian rural females who received vocational/technical, are trained in Textiles and handlooms, apparels ﬁeld. Around 30.2% of total urban females who received vocational/technical, are trained in IT-ITeS ﬁeld. Around 5.0% rural females and 8.6% urban females received training in the beauty and wellness ﬁeld. 10 2.4 Similar Schemes and Programmes ● Support to Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP)- To provide skills that give employability to women that beneﬁt in the age group of 16 and above in India. ● Mahila Shakti Kendras (MSK)- It is designed to offer comprehensive support services to women to help them develop skills, ﬁnd job opportunities, and improve their digital literacy.

Methodology and Evaluation Design 3.1 Technical Approach and Methodology 3.1.1 Evaluation Framework: Incorporating a gendered lens to the study Keeping the ﬁndings from the secondary literature in mind, it is critical to employ a gendered lens in reexamining the program’s theory of change, course design, delivery methods, and overall impact. The evaluation design should be rooted in feminist principles 12 while accounting for intersectionalities such as disability, age, and education, which exacerbate inequities . The study approach is detailed in the proposal and in the annexure . As discussed in the literature review , women&amp;#x27;s need for empowerment in employment arises from systemic exclusion and gender-based disparities in access to opportunities, reinforced by social norms, institutional biases, and structural barriers. Empowerment enables women to exercise agency, assert their rights, and gain autonomy over their choices. Autonomy—the freedom to make choices, implying the presence of alternatives to pursue decisions and actions —can be understood through three stages of social change : resources, agency, and achievements. ● Resources : refer to access 13 to economic, social, and human capital necessary for decision-making. ● Agency : involves voicing opinions and inﬂuencing strategic life decisions, shaped by multiple 14 personal factors (e.g., conﬁdence, perceived gender roles, self-esteem) and relational factors (e.g., family perceptions of gender roles, control over assets, household support). ● Achievements : are the positive outcomes resulting from improved resource access and enhanced agency. Tech Mahindra Foundation’s SMART program addresses these stages by targeting women from economically disadvantaged households and individuals with disabilities. It removes barriers to capacity-building resources and provides placement support to secure employment. The program enhances foundational skills, such as communication, technical abilities, and a future-oriented vision, contributing to participants&amp;#x27; agency and offering better choices for ﬁnancial stability and independence—core elements of empowerment. The program&amp;#x27;s theory of change and pathways to impact are visualized below. 14 Lombardini, S., Bowman, K., Garwood, R. (2017). A ‘How To’ Guide to Measuring Women’s Empowerment .

These challenges stem from a lack of awareness about relevant opportunities, insufﬁcient employment-related skills, and barriers to accessing capacity-building resources. The historic exclusion of women and people with disabilities has entrenched structural barriers, including restrictive gender and social norms, inadequate workplace and public accessibility infrastructure, concerns about workplace safety, and societal expectations tied to marriage, household responsibilities, and family life. Addressing these barriers is critical for sustaining long-term outcomes. Changes in societal norms, coupled with practical support systems like childcare and accessible workplaces, are essential to advancing economic empowerment. Insights from the literature, combined with pathways of change toward empowerment, indicate that achieving short-term and some long-term outcomes falls within the program’s scope. However, realizing the intended impact—long-term empowerment in participants’ personal and professional lives—requires deeper exploration of ecosystem-level enabling and disabling factors and potential levers for fostering empowerment. The fundamental building blocks for women’s economic empowerment can be grouped into four categories: ecosystem, enablers, levers, and outcomes. These are visualized and detailed below. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 10 --- Page 11 --- 3.1.3 Framework of Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE Pyramid) Ecosystem Ecosystem factors lay the groundwork for systemic change, enabling other interventions to take root. Societal norms and structural systems shape access and opportunities for women, particularly those with disabilities. Norms related to marriage, education, and work often restrict independence and agency. Structural elements like accessible infrastructure, inclusive transport, workplace adjustments, and gender-sensitive policies are critical for equitable participation. Policies such as pay parity and anti-discrimination laws further support inclusivity. Enablers Enablers address systemic and individual barriers, equipping individuals with resources and capacities to exercise agency and achieve empowerment. Examples include education, ﬁnancial assets, good physical and mental health, suitable roles and accessibility measures for persons with disabilities, supportive households and community relationships, and a positive future outlook. These factors enable women and others to build capabilities, access opportunities for ﬁnancial independence, and become empowered through shared learning, mutual support, and advocacy. Enablers provide both tangible (e.g., ﬁnancial and technical skills) and intangible (e.g., conﬁdence and resilience) capacities needed for agency. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd . (h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 11 --- Page 12 --- Levers While enablers provide foundational support by addressing barriers like health, education, and access to resources, whereas levers focus on t ranslating these into actionable outcomes, such as employment, entrepreneurship, or ﬁnancial growth, by directly connecting individuals to opportunities. For example, skill development programs aligned with industry needs—particularly those inclusive of women with disabilities—enhance job readiness. Financial tools like microloans and mentorship expand access to capital and networks, while job placement services and market-aligned training ensure smoother workforce transitions. These levers amplify the impact of enablers, helping individuals achieve economic stability and long-term empowerment. Outcome The ultimate outcome is economic empowerment, characterized by ﬁnancial independence, decision-making agency, and equitable societal participation. This empowerment encompasses personal dimensions (e.g., self-esteem and the ability to vocalize and act on choices) and social dimensions ( e.g., leveraging social networks to access better opportunities) . These interconnected elements reinforce one another; for example, earning an income fosters independence, challenges societal perceptions, and strengthens self-esteem. Over time, these shifts contribute to a more inclusive society, where women and individuals with disabilities are recognized as equal contributors, reshaping the ecosystem. The WEE (Women’s Economic Empowerment) blocks visualize empowerment as an interconnected, transformative process. Given the scope of program activities, the primary focus is on assessing changes in economic empowerment, speciﬁcally participants’ ability to earn a stable income, while considering the broader ecosystem&amp;#x27;s impact on these outcomes. 3.1.4 Layers of Empowerment and Scope of Programme’s Impact Tech Mahindra’s SMART program leverages job capacity development, readiness, channel creation, and capital-building to enhance employability . Employability , in turn, improves women’s mobility, earning potential, decision-making about income, and conﬁdence, while building social capital through new networks. Together, these factors contribute to economic empowerment. Achieving deeper, long-term change requires concurrent shifts in ecosystem-level factors and economic empowerment, as outcomes are inﬂuenced by the environment and other stakeholders. For instance , a woman’s household decision-making power depends not only on her earning ability and income contribution but also on gender norms, family dynamics, and relationship quality. Similarly, access to better career opportunities is shaped by policies mandating accommodations for people with disabilities, safety measures for women, and general infrastructure supporting mobility. These concurrent shifts improve equity and inclusion, enabling strategic life choices that enhance resilience and well-being. Understanding the layered nature of empowerment is key to distinguishing outcomes directly inﬂuenced by the program from those shaped by broader ecosystem factors.

These include shifts in gender norms, family relationships, and policies that promote equity and inclusion. This perspective ensures a realistic assessment of the program’s impact, acknowledging the interplay between immediate outcomes and broader environmental inﬂuences. Major assessment themes and empowerment and employment dimensions are detailed in the annexure , with narratives provided in the ﬁnal proposal. The study will adopt a mixed-methods approach for data collection and analysis. Analytical methods referenced in the proposal, including Most Signiﬁcant Stories of Change and Section 3.3.5 Analysis, Synthesis, and Reporting , will guide the process. Additionally, the program&amp;#x27;s impact may be reviewed using the GEDSI framework 15 and continuum. 3.2 Sampling Participants for the study will be sampled from the MIS data of alumni provided by the TMF program team. The shared variables will be used to create selection categories. As outlined in the proposal, the total sample size for the study is set at 1,500, ensuring statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings and coverage of at least 5% of the participant population.

The MIS data collected had a total of 29,785 observations, spread across 15 locations 18 . After cleaning the shared data by removing duplicates and missing values in mobile numbers, and some outliers in family income, we have data for 27,443 participants across 12 cities. Of these, two cities - Nagpur and Raipur were dropped from the sample selection due to having a very small number of participants in the overall population. These are tabulated by the city in the annexure. To capture the impact across demographics, disability status, industry and course, and programme intensity, etc. to bring out differences in impact and experience across groups. While selecting the sample, we will maintain representation across some primary and secondary factors, across both centre and participant level, considered from the MIS data. # Factor / Variable Categories Rationale Centre Level 1 City 10* cities, sampled proportionately across each city Regional representation 2 Financial Year 2021-22 (~31%); 2022-23 (~32%) ; 2023-24 (~37%) To capture sustainability of outcomes, and conversion into long term impact; Enabling and disabling factors. 3 Type of Centre Health Care Academy (13%); Digital Technology (4.5%); SMART+ (6%); SMART-T (2%); SMART (72%) Capture different models of operations, course structures and methodology, etc. 4 Domain Employer sector domains, to be categorised To assess sustained employability and differences in work environment. 5 Partner Category 19 -engagement with minority groups -number of years with community Yes/No for minority communities; Range of years based on received data Assess the impact of partner level factors on programme delivery, outcome achievement, and broader impact in their communities Participant Level 19 Other factors that can be considered during analysis would be other domains partners work in and number of years withTMF, though these are secondary and not necessary. The ﬁnal categorisation will be done upon receiving the required information from TMF 18 Separate locations are given for New Delhi, Delhi and East Delhi. These will be combined under “Delhi” while sampling, unless the population is signiﬁcantly different among the groups. Chandigarh and Mohali are considered as the same location. 17 Given the 70% placement rate, most of the alumni would be working and it might be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a convenient time to meet in person. To avoid signiﬁcant delays in data collection, we will conduct telephonic surveys with a proportion of participants or cities where the sample size exceeds 100 respondents, we will utilise both methods to maximise reach and reliability. In cities with smaller sample sizes, we will primarily rely on telephonic interviews. Approximately 40% of the total interviews will be conducted face-to-face, but this number can be revised based on availability and timeline. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

During selection of individual partners, the selection of samples will be done proportional to that in the population sample in terms of cities.

Given that the sample is distributed across 10 cities, including some with smaller sample sizes, there is a chance that, despite multiple attempts, we may not be able to reach all respondents. To address this, we will need support from the Tech Mahindra team in ensuring an adequate number of respondents are available on the designated workdays. Additionally, we would appreciate assistance in mobilising respondents for the telephonic interviews. 3.3.1 Methodology: Most Signiﬁcant Stories of Change Most Signiﬁcant Stories of Change is suggested as a participatory method that would be used to track the geography and vulnerability-speciﬁc intended and unintended narratives of change in outcomes shared by participants and pinpoint the ones that are most effective. The merit of utilizing this technique lies in the fact that it involves and engages with the participants as well as the program staff (ﬁeld staff, programme teams) along with the funding agency giving voice to perspectives of most of the stakeholders throughout the chain. Suitability of this method for this study is detailed in the proposal . 3.3.2 Qualitative Data Collection The analysis of the quantitative data will inform the development of qualitative tools and enable us to purposefully select participants. This will help us delve deeper into the pathways of change. As mentioned earlier, this approach will also help us identify relevant case stories, both where signiﬁcant impact was observed and where it was not. It will guide us in selecting participants for in-depth interviews. While we aim to identify these particular cases, we also want to understand how changes have occurred (or not) under different pre-conditions that can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the level of change in employability and empowerment. Sample checklists of these parameters, both external (environmental) and internal (personal and relational), that we would consider for qualitative sample selection can be referred through the proposal . In addition to triangulating and verifying our ﬁndings, having multiple perspectives will also bring out more nuances into the stories of change of these participants. Based on the information gathered and keeping in mind sampling parameters discussed in Sampling Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The number and type of interactions, along with the stakeholders involved are tabulated below. Qualitative Sample Stakeholders Tools / Methods # Details 1 Women participants In Depth interviews 24 4 per location FGD (8-10 women) 12 2 per location 2 Family Members of participants In Depth interviews 12 2 per location 3 Employers (Across domains) Key Informant Interviews 3 By domain/industry 4 Trainers / Teachers (Programme Staff including Tech Mahindra Foundation, NGOs) Key Informant Interviews 6 1 per location 5 Skill Development Industry Experts Key Informant Interviews 3 - Total Interactions 60 It is important to note that the success of the timely data collection particularly for face-to-face and telephonic data collection, is contingent on Tech Mahindra ensuring an adequate number of respondents are available on the assigned workdays and that they actively engage with the research team. For telephonic interviews, it is critical that respondents answer the calls and participate willingly, as this directly impacts the reliability and representativeness of the data. Additionally, we will require active support from Tech Mahindra in mobilising respondents for telephonic interviews. This includes ensuring respondents are informed about the purpose of the study, the timing of calls, and the importance of their participation, as well as addressing any hesitations or logistical barriers they may face. This collaborative effort is essential to ensure smooth data collection and the overall success of the evaluation process. 3.4 QC and Assurance Quality control and assurance measures form an integral part of the evaluation studies conducted by CMS. This encompasses tool testing, enumerator selection, training of the ﬁeld team members on the tools, data monitoring and its management and cleaning. These are the indispensable steps that ensure quality evaluation. The detailed process of quality control and assurance can be found in the proposal . 22 The cities for qualitative data collection will be ﬁnalized after quantitative data analysis.

We will analyze descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, quartile or decile distribution, along with frequency tables of outcome and impact indicators, to assess the level of impact. 3.5.2 Qualitative Analysis The study will analyze the qualitative data collected through the FGDs, IDIs and KIIs using qualitative software such as Nvivo or Atlas.ti, using analytical techniques like narrative analysis and thematic analysis. For further details on the analysis and steps involved, please read the proposal . 3.5.3 Reporting The ﬁnal report will present the overall ﬁndings of the study, highlighting the changes experienced by women participants in improving their employability and how this contributed to their empowerment. While empowerment can be a signiﬁcant result of improved employability and income achieved through the program, the relationship is not strictly linear. There are certain preconditions, as noted in our measurement and sampling framework, that can either enable or inhibit women from making the most of the opportunities provided by the program and becoming empowered. This process often takes time, requiring changes both within and outside the woman, which progress at different paces and with different sets of preconditions. Therefore, an in-depth analysis and synthesis of ﬁndings from both methods will truly enable us to uncover signiﬁcant stories of change and understand the program’s contribution to the overall process. Through our approach, we can effectively bring these stories to the forefront. We will highlight success stories, enablers, barriers, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. By combining quantitative metrics of change across years and contexts with our narratives, we will be able to showcase the program&amp;#x27;s impact, pathways to change, and sustainability of the impact. Additionally, we will provide recommendations that can be adopted by the program to strengthen its approach towards women’s empowerment. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

The recce visits provided a comprehensive understanding of TMF’s SMART Academies&amp;#x27; operations, challenges, and successes. Documented success stories and identiﬁed challenges offer valuable insights for reﬁning the impact assessment process. These ﬁndings will inform a detailed evaluation of the program’s effectiveness and long-term impact and underscore TMF&amp;#x27;s impactful contributions to women empowerment while highlighting areas for enhancement to expand its reach and efﬁcacy. 5.3: Overall Findings from recce visit Aligned with the Theory of Change (ToC) Activities 1. Engagement and Mobilisation – The centres showed strong mobilisation efforts to connect with marginalized communities. These efforts included door-to-door campaigns, partnerships with NGOs and community leaders, and leveraging alumni networks to encourage participation. Social media campaigns were also utilized, particularly for reaching urban and peri-urban populations. At the Safa Tech Mahindra Centre in Hyderabad, family engagement was prioritized to support women’s participation, addressing cultural barriers. While these efforts were impactful, challenges such as low awareness about speciﬁc programs in some regions were observed. 2. Counselling and Vision Building – Career counselling sessions played a signiﬁcant role in motivating participants to pursue skill-based training. Counsellors worked closely with prospective trainees and their families to highlight the value of these programs, especially for women. These sessions aligned individual aspirations with market demands, boosting conﬁdence and overcoming barriers such as misinformation or limited awareness about career opportunities. In locations like the Healthcare Academy in Bandra, counsellors actively addressed family concerns, ensuring greater enrolment and retention. 3. Training and Skilling – The training programs combined foundational skills like English and IT with domain-speciﬁc technical knowledge and soft skills development. Practical and theoretical components were balanced to prepare participants for the workforce. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Trainers emphasized the importance of practical exposure in building conﬁdence and technical proﬁciency. While most centres had well-equipped training facilities, some gaps were identiﬁed, such as limited access to advanced tools in speciﬁc courses. Outputs Observations during the visits highlighted several key outputs that aligned with the program’s objectives, such as- 1. Number of Centres and Programs– The network included 75 SMART Centres offering training across 15 domains, with 12 specialized academies focusing on areas such as healthcare, logistics, and IT/digital technologies. This extensive reach enabled the program to cater to a diverse group of youth across various regions. 2. Scholarships and Accessibility – Scholarships and subsidized fees were instrumental in making the programs accessible to students from economically weaker backgrounds. Women and differently-abled individuals particularly beneﬁted from ﬁnancial aid, which helped reduce dropout rates and improve participation. 3. Certiﬁcations and Employability – Certiﬁcations provided by the academies were aligned with industry requirements, enhancing participants&amp;#x27; employability. These certiﬁcations were highly valued by alumni, as they increased credibility during job applications and interviews. 4. Placement and Employment – Placement support was an integral component of the program. Centres maintained strong industry partnerships, which facilitated employment opportunities for participants. Placement rates ranged from 75% to 100% for several courses, with graduates securing jobs in organisations such as Titan, Delhivery, Leela, Reliance and Radisson. Alumni reported starting salaries between Rs10,000 and Rs18,000, reﬂecting the effectiveness of the placement process. Outcomes While the focus of the visits was primarily on understanding operational processes, some initial observations of outcomes were noted during the visits. Findings from the visits conﬁrmed several outputs, including the wide availability of centres and programs, ﬁnancial support mechanisms, and industry-recognized certiﬁcations. These outputs provided a solid foundation for achieving the program’s desired outcomes and impacts. However, gaps were noted in areas like dropout tracking, alumni progression, and the identiﬁcation of barriers faced by trainees. Addressing these gaps in future evaluations would enhance the program’s ability to assess its achievements comprehensively and address areas for improvement. 1. Short-Term Outcomes – Participants demonstrated improved technical and communication skills. The practical aspects of the training, such as internships and live projects, enhanced job-speciﬁc expertise and prepared trainees for workplace challenges. These short-term improvements were reported across various centres. 2. Long-Term Potential – Although systematic long-term data and changes over the period was not captured during the visits, feedback from alumni suggested progress Catalyst Management Services Pvt.

(h t t p s : / / s o l v i s t s . o r g . i n / ) 25 4 th Floor AECS Layout, RMV 2 nd Stage, Ashwathnagar, Bangalore 560094 Email: c o n t a c t u s @ c a t a l y s t s . o r g | CIN: U92111KA1995PTCO18377 25 --- Page 26 --- toward ﬁnancial independence and stability. Most of the Alumni interviewed shared that they were contributing to household incomes or managing their ﬁnances independently. Women trainees showed increased conﬁdence and decision-making capabilities, which were reﬂected in their professional and personal growth. Impact While the reconnaissance visits were not designed to formally measure or validate program impacts, some potential outcomes and transformative changes were evident: 1. Employability and Income: The programs have signiﬁcantly enhanced participants&amp;#x27; employability and income-generating capabilities. Alumni shared stories of transitioning from unemployment to stable jobs, leading to improved ﬁnancial security and better living conditions for their families. These experiences underscore the program&amp;#x27;s role in addressing economic challenges and fostering long-term stability. 2. Agency and Empowerment: Women participants demonstrated increased conﬁdence and an active role in household decision-making. At the Safa Centre, graduates of the Women Entrepreneur Development Program successfully started small businesses, breaking cultural barriers and creating economic opportunities for themselves and others within their communities. 3. Indications of Broader Impact: Many current female students reported being inspired by alumni success stories (either from family members or neighbours or friends/relatives), which encouraged them to enrol in the programs with aspirations for ﬁnancial independence and self-reliance. This highlights the ripple effect of the programs, showcasing their potential to inﬂuence not only individual trajectories but also broader community mindsets, contributing to lasting social and economic empowerment. These ﬁndings demonstrate how the program’s activities and outputs are contributing to positive changes in participants’ lives. Strengthening operational processes and addressing identiﬁed gaps will further enhance the program’s impact on employability, ﬁnancial stability, and empowerment for marginalized communities. The main survey will assess indicators aligned with the Theory of Change to evaluate program effectiveness. It will explore participant engagement, inclusivity of onboarding, and training relevance, along with outputs like accessibility, certiﬁcations, and placement success. Outcomes such as employment sustainability, income growth, and ﬁnancial independence will be tracked, alongside broader impacts like shifts in decision-making roles, community perceptions, and entrepreneurial success, capturing the program’s transformative potential. 6.

Now earning a CTC of Rs 19,200, she is easing her family’s ﬁnancial burdens and enabling a more comfortable life, even as she begins to explore the empowering potential of her new role. 3. SMART Academy for Logistics: After completing a B.Sc. in Statistics from Avanti College, Hyderabad in 2016, this 28-year-old from Secunderabad decided to switch his career path. With his father working as a daily-wage mason, he aspired to provide his family with a life of dignity. Previously employed as an Operations Manager at Tkzus, a Florida based company, the night shifts took a toll on his health. Discovering the Supply Chain Management course at Tech Mahindra SMART Academy for Logistics through social media, he enrolled in November 2023.. With guidance and support from Mr. Yogender and Ms. Deepthi, he opted for the course at an affordable fee. He learned new skills and gained valuable insights into supply chain operations and IT. Now working as a Learning and Development Trainer at Zepto in Begumpet, he oversees 27 stores across Hyderabad, earning Rs 38,000 monthly. Though earning slightly less than his previous role, he values the better work-life balance (10 AM–7 PM shifts) and sees signiﬁcant growth opportunities in the supply chain sector, including potential roles abroad. Grateful for his experience, he aspires to contribute to the same academy as a faculty that helped him achieve this change. 4.

The training equipped her with in-demand technical skills and boosted her conﬁdence for the corporate world. Now employed at Deepija Telecom Pvt. Ltd., she earns Rs 32,000 per month, which she says is a signiﬁcant milestone for her family. Her job not only provides ﬁnancial stability but also gives her the opportunity to uplift her family and ensure a secure future. Grateful for the academy&amp;#x27;s role in her journey, she remains committed to her career growth. Catalyst Management Services Pvt. Ltd .

Smart Plus Centre- Association of People with Disability (Bangalore) Bhagyashree, a young woman from a four-member family in North Karnataka, has a locomotor disability and faced signiﬁcant ﬁnancial challenges. Her family&amp;#x27;s situation worsened four years ago when her father suffered a debilitating stroke, leaving him permanently paralyzed. This forced her younger brother, then only 15, to drop out of school and take up menial jobs to support the household. In 2023, Bhagyashree enrolled in the BPO course at the SMART Plus Centre run by APD. Upon completing the course, she secured a position with Vindhya Infomedia.

It has to follow a pre-specified format, and Excel&amp;#x27;s conditional formatting has been used to auto-highlight rows that appear to have a valid type column -- so, if you are using Excel and your row is not automatically highlighted, re-check that you have entered the type properly. \n\nSee below for an exhaustive list of brief examples. This column specifies the name of the field or group. Field names must be unique, and they cannot include any spaces or punctuation. \n\nExample: age For those field types that present a user interface, this column is where you put the primary text for the question or field. You can include line-breaks in your label text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac. Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Text in this column, if any, will appear italicized beneath the field&amp;#x27;s label. You can include line-breaks in your hint text by pressing Alt+Enter on Windows or Control+Option+Enter on a Mac. Any hint:languagename column (e.g., hint:tamil) may be added in order to provide hints in an alternative language.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. If you want to default the user&amp;#x27;s entry or selection for a given field, you can specify a number or some text in this column. \n\nAlternatively, you can specify an expression for dynamically calculating the field&amp;#x27;s default entry or selection, in the &amp;quot;calculation&amp;quot; column. View the help topic below for more details.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. For field types that allow multiple appearances, you can specify the appearance style in this column (e.g., quick or minimal for select_one fields). \n\nSee the individual examples below. Enter an expression into this column to validate entered or selected values. The user will only be allowed to proceed to the next question when the expression evaluates to true. Use the constraint builder to build new constraint expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) \n\nExample: . &amp;lt; 130\n\nView the help topic below for more details. If the user tries to move forward but the constraint expression is false, a generic &amp;quot;That entry is invalid&amp;quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Any constraint message:languagename column (e.g., constraint message:tamil) may be added in order to provide constraint messages in an alternative language. Enter an expression into this column to control when a field or group displays to the user (i.e., to control when it is &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot;). The field or group will only show up to users when the expression in this column evaluates to true; otherwise, it will remain hidden. Use the relevance builder to build new relevance expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.) \n\nExample: ${age} &amp;lt; 18\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Enter yes into this column to temporarily disable a field. (Rarely used.)\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Enter yes into this column to require that users enter or select a value before continuing.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. If the user tries to move forward without entering or selecting a value for a required field, a generic &amp;quot;Sorry, this response is required&amp;quot; message will appear; to override this message on a field-by-field basis, enter another message into this column.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Any required message:languagename column (e.g., required message:tamil) may be added in order to provide required messages in an alternative language. Enter yes into this column to make it read-only (a user can see the field, but cannot enter or select a value). (Rarely used, because note fields, which are by nature read-only, are automatically read-only regardless of what is specified here.) This column specifies the expression to use for a calculate field, or the expression to use for calculating the default entry or selection for a visible form field. Use the calculation builder to build new calculation expressions. (Also see the expression quick-reference following the examples below.)\n\nView the help topic below for more details. For a begin repeat row, this column can specify the number of times to repeat the group of questions. (Can be a fixed count like 3 or a reference to an earlier field like ${numhh_members}.)\n\nView the help topic below for more details. To include an image to display for a field (in addition to or in lieu of its label), its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. \n\nExample: paddy.png\n\nView the help topic below for more details. To include a sound clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. \n\nExample: explanation.3gpp\n\nView the help topic below for more details. To include a video clip that can be played at a field, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device. \n\nExample: demonstration.mp4\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Any media:image:languagename column (e.g., media:image:tamil) may be added in order to provide images for an alternative language.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Any media:audio:languagename column (e.g., media:audio:tamil) may be added in order to provide audio clips for an alternative language.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Any media:video:languagename column (e.g., media:video:tamil) may be added in order to provide video clips for an alternative language.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. When filtering lists of multiple-choice options, this column specifies, for each field, which prior field should be used when filtering the list of options. \n\nExample: filter=${survey_region}\n\nView the help topic below for more details. This column can specify an optional note to appear with the field in printable versions of the survey form, in order to explain when groups or fields will appear (i.e., when they are relevant), what restrictions there are on user entries (i.e., what constraints apply), etc. This column can specify optional text or symbols to appear in the response area to the right of questions in printable versions of the survey form. For a text field, for example, you might put something like |___|___| if you are looking for two letters or numbers; or, for a checkbox, you might put a hollow square like □ (this is a special HTML character: enter &amp;quot;&amp;amp;#9633;&amp;quot;, without quotes, into this column); finally, for a radio button, you might simply enter a capital O. Enter yes into this column to indicate that a field in an encrypted form should be left unencrypted so that it can be published to one or more datasets. Use only for non-sensitive fields that can be left unencrypted without compromising data security. (This field is ignored for unencrypted forms.)\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Enter a number of seconds that represents the minimum time enumerators should spend the first time they view the field. This represents a &amp;quot;speed limit&amp;quot; that can be enforced by SurveyCTO Collect for Android (with the Enforce minimum times for fields option within Collect&amp;#x27;s Admin Settings); alternatively, you can track violations with the following field types: &amp;quot;speed violations count&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;speed violations list&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;speed violations audit&amp;quot; (see examples for these field types below).\n\nView the help topic below for more details.

A given list of options will involve multiple rows, each with the same list_name. Example: yesno This column specifies the internal value stored for a given choice. (It should really be called &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;.) Example: 1\n\nIf dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load option values. This column specifies the label to use for a given choice, in the form&amp;#x27;s default language. Example: Yes\n\nIf dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name -- or comma-separated list of column names -- from which to load option labels for the default language. Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide labels in an alternative language.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. To include an image to display for an option, its filename should be specified here (and the file should be uploaded with this form defintion). Which media file formats are supported will depend on your Android device, but all devices support common image formats like .jpg or .png. Example: paddy.png\n\nIf dynamically loading from a pre-loaded .csv file, this should instead be the .csv column name from which to load image filenames.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. Any label:languagename column (e.g., label:tamil) may be added in order to provide images in an alternative language. To filter the list of options displayed, a filter value can be specified here, along with a filter expression in the choice_filter column of the survey worksheet. For example, you might have filter values like LAC and a choice_filter like filter=${survey_region}.

NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN form_title form_id version public_key submission_url default_language This is the title of your form. Enumerators will use the title to tell different forms apart. You will be able to revise the title of the form through subsequent form updates.\n\nIf you begin this title with TEST - (as in &amp;quot;TEST - Household listing survey&amp;quot;), it will not appear by default to users. View the help topic below for more details. This is the unique ID that will identify the form. The form ID must not contain spaces and must remain fixed for the life of the form. The form ID must also begin with a letter, and it can only include letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens (no other punctuation or special characters).\n\nExample: hhlisting_round1 This is the version number of the form, which you must increase each time you modify an existing form. If you started with a form template or with one of the sample forms, then this is automatic: the version is set to a formula that automatically increments every minute. (Otherwise, you need to increment the version number yourself, taking care to keep the number of digits fixed; the version has to be a single whole number, and its number of digits has to stay the same from one version to the next. The convention is to always use a ten-digit number that represents the current date and time, e.g., 1401130917 for 9:17AM on January 13, 2014. Alternatively, you can use 10-digit numbers like 0000000001 and 0000000024 or 3-digit numbers like 001 and 024.)\n\nView the help topic below for more details. This is the public key with which to encrypt all form submissions.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. This is the submission URL to use when submitting encrypted forms.\n\nView the help topic below for more details. This is the name of the language associated with labels, images, and other content when no other language is specified. For example, the label:french column is clearly in French, but the label column, which will display by default, is in an unknown language. Put the name of that default language here. \n\nView the help topic below for more details.

    <Content>Multi-country study to explore the relationship between vaccine equity, climate, and health By: Catalyst Management Services (With Support from Country Partners) BACKGROUND &amp;amp; RATIONALE The impact of climate change is multifaceted and poses significant challenges across various sectors. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events have adverse effects on livelihoods, access to clean water, and public health. These countries witness heightened risks of heatwaves, floods, and droughts, leading to agricultural disruptions, food insecurity, and economic losses. Vulnerable populations, including indigenous communities and those in remote areas, are particularly susceptible to these impacts. Additionally, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, affecting public health. The variability in climate conditions further exacerbates challenges in healthcare delivery, including routine immunization, as extreme weather events disrupt infrastructure and create logistical hurdles. Recognizing the broader implications of climate change on these nations is crucial for developing adaptive strategies, resilient healthcare systems, and sustainable development practices to mitigate the far-reaching consequences on the environment, economy, and public health. [1] In the Philippines, Cambodia, and India, primary health care (PHC) stands as a vital pillar for promoting holistic well-being, with a common reliance on community health workers to bridge gaps in healthcare access and build trust among diverse populations. While the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act in the Philippines underscores the importance of equitable access, these nations grapple with persistent barriers such as limited resources, financial constraints, and disparities in healthcare, further exacerbated by the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. [2] Each country addresses these issues through initiatives like free routine vaccinations and maternal health programs, recognizing the importance of preventive care. Cambodia faces population growth challenges, particularly in impoverished northeastern regions, with indigenous communities encountering hurdles related to education and early marriage [3]. Meanwhile, India contends with a dual obstacle of low awareness and operational difficulties in routine immunization, compounded by cultural beliefs and logistical constraints. Collectively, these nations emphasize the need for improved infrastructure, increased healthcare workforce engagement, and resilient health systems to navigate existing challenges and enhance the effectiveness of routine health programs.[4] Climate change poses significant challenges to the healthcare systems of the Philippines, Cambodia, and India, with distinct impacts on each country. In the Philippines, a country susceptible to typhoons and extreme weather events, the changing climate can lead to disruptions in healthcare infrastructure, affecting the delivery of essential health services. The vulnerability of the Philippines to natural disasters, exacerbated by the effects of climate change, may result in challenges in providing timely and consistent healthcare, especially in the wake of frequent typhoons and floods.[5] Similarly, Cambodia, facing potential changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures, may experience disruptions in agricultural practices, affecting the livelihoods of communities. The Plateau and Mountains region, with its indigenous populations, may be particularly vulnerable, facing socio-economic challenges aggravated by the impacts of climate change on agricultural activities.[6] In India, a country with diverse climate patterns, extreme weather events such as heatwaves and floods can hinder routine immunization programs, especially in remote and underserved areas. The increased health risks, coupled with existing operational challenges in the healthcare sector, create a complex scenario where climate change compounds the difficulties in delivering essential health services. Addressing these challenges requires not only strengthening healthcare infrastructure and accessibility but also implementing adaptive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on the health and well-being of these nations.[7] The study is of paramount importance as it delves into the intricate interplay between climate change impacts and vaccine equity in these regions. The information gathered from the three countries underscores the vulnerabilities of health systems, particularly in the face of environmental crises, emphasizing the need for resilience and adaptability. By shedding light on challenges related to healthcare accessibility, infrastructure inadequacies, and cultural dynamics influencing vaccine acceptance, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted barriers faced by these nations. Additionally, the identification of operational challenges during environmental crises and the proposed policy implications and adaptation strategies offer valuable insights for strengthening health systems and ensuring equitable vaccine distribution. As climate change increasingly affects global health, this study contributes vital data from diverse Southeast Asian contexts, making it a significant and timely endeavor with implications for international efforts to address the intersection of climate change and healthcare equity. AIM OF THE STUDY To understand how weather events such as floods, droughts, heat waves, cold waves, etc., and climate change affect the supply and access of vaccines for vulnerable communities in specific regions in each of the three Southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. METHODS Study Design A cross-sectional mixed methods approach was employed to investigate the intricate relationship between climate change and vaccine inequity among vulnerable populations in Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. This methodological framework facilitated a thorough exploration of the factors contributing to vaccination disparities and the influence of climate-related events on exacerbating these disparities. Study setting The study encompassed a comprehensive approach to understanding the dynamics of vaccination inequities and climate change impacts across 3 Southeast Asian regions: Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. The geographical diversity of these regions provided a rich tapestry of cultural, social, and environmental contexts that influenced healthcare access and vulnerability to climate-related health risks. In Cambodia, Mondulkiri, Preah Vihear, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, and Siem Reap provinces were targeted due to the indigenous population and their vulnerability to climate change impacts, such as floods and disruptions in accessing healthcare services. Despite commendable vaccination coverage rates for key antigens like BCG and DTP-containing vaccines, Cambodia faces notable gaps, particularly in the coverage for the second dose of the measles-containing vaccine, standing at 69%(8). The selected provinces have diverse demographic compositions and have experienced climate-related hazards, including floods and droughts, which can disrupt healthcare services and access to vaccines(9). In the Philippines, Barangay Bagong Silangan, Baguio City, and Tobacco City were selected for the study. These areas have encountered climate-related events such as typhoons and floods, which have significantly impacted healthcare infrastructure and the distribution of vaccines. According to the WHO&amp;#x27;s Philippines country profile on immunization for 2023, the country has made considerable strides in vaccination coverage for various antigens. The vaccination coverage for fully immunized children under one year of age stands at 76%(10). The susceptibility of these areas to typhoons and floods can disrupt healthcare services, including vaccine delivery and administration. In India, the study encompassed various regions with differing population sizes and characteristics. Assam State, including Darrang District&amp;#x27;s Kharupetia and Jalijali blocks, along with Chhattisgarh State&amp;#x27;s Kanker District&amp;#x27;s Kanker and Narharpur blocks, were selected. Raipur District&amp;#x27;s Arang and Darsiwa blocks were also included. These areas were chosen due to their susceptibility to climate-related events and their diverse demographic profiles, including Tribal communities, mountain regions, migrated populations, and river bank communities, geographically isolated areas. According to NFHS data, vaccination coverage in Chhattisgarh stands at 80%, Raipur at 75%, and Kanker at 89%. However, in Assam, the coverage is notably lower, with only 66.4% coverage, and Darrang District reports 57%(11). Study Participants The sampling approach employed a stratified random sampling method, with estimated sample sizes of 384 for India, 385 for Cambodia, and 384 for the Philippines, calculated to provide statistically representative samples for conducting cross-sectional prevalence studies with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%. Table 1: illustrates the community survey samples from the respective study settings: The study participants consisted of primary beneficiaries of vaccination programs and caretakers of primary beneficiaries, representing individuals directly impacted by vaccination policies and healthcare services. Additionally, key informant interviews and focus group discussions involved stakeholders such as healthcare professionals, frontline workers, policymakers, and community representatives. These stakeholders provided critical insights into existing inequities, climate change impacts, and community coping mechanisms. Recruitment of participants was facilitated through civil society organizations with extensive experience in working with vulnerable populations, ensuring access to marginalized communities and diverse stakeholders. For the quantitative surveys, participants were selected based on their status as beneficiaries of vaccination programs and their willingness to participate in the study. Those above the age of 18 were enrolled from the community side, ensuring a broad representation of adults impacted by vaccination policies. For qualitative data collection, a concept saturation-driven methodology was employed to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the research focus. Participants for key informant interviews and focus group discussions were identified using a snowballing technique, inviting individuals with critical insights and expertise until information saturation was reached. Data Collection and Tools Based on literature examining vaccine inequity and climate change, a structured questionnaire was developed in English for the community-based surveys. The tool was piloted in all 3 countries with the support of local partners and was modified based on the observations from the ground. Before administering the tool to the participants, it was translated into the local languages such as Hindi (India), with aids for enumerators and researchers in Assamese (India), Khmer (Cambodia), and Filipino (Philippines) - spoken in the study sites. The tool captured information on the following areas: Socio-demographic characteristics: The structured questionnaire comprehensively captured socio-demographic characteristics to understand the diverse profiles of the participants. This included information on age, gender, education level, occupation, household composition, and socio-economic status which are essential for contextualizing vaccine access and equity, as they can influence healthcare-seeking behavior and access to vaccination services. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to vaccination: It assessed their awareness of vaccine-preventable diseases, understanding of the importance of vaccination, and beliefs regarding vaccine safety and efficacy. Additionally, it explored vaccination practices, including adherence to vaccination schedules and reasons for vaccine acceptance or refusal. Access to vaccination services: Access to vaccination services was another key area covered by the questionnaire. It examined participants&amp;#x27; access to healthcare facilities offering vaccination services, including the distance to the nearest vaccination center, availability of vaccines, and affordability of vaccination services. Furthermore, it assessed barriers to access, such as transportation issues, financial constraints, and perceptions of service quality. In addition to that, the survey also measured the recent changes in weather conditions and the perceived impact of climate change on vaccine access and inequity. Participants were asked about their observations of weather patterns, such as changes in temperature, rainfall, and frequency of extreme weather events. Additionally, they were queried about how these climate-related changes affected their ability to access vaccination services, including disruptions in service delivery, damage to healthcare infrastructure, and changes in healthcare-seeking behavior due to climate-related concerns. The key outcome variables that were assessed were vaccination status and perceived accessibility to vaccine services. The stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured guide to deeply understand their experiences with accessing vaccination, existing inequities and pathways that contribute to and exacerbate such inequities among different subsets of populations, etc. The qualitative discussions also probed to understand the community and provider perspective on the nuanced interplay between climate change and vaccine inequity. Ethical Considerations The study obtained ethical approval from the Catalyst Foundation Institutional Review Board. The team explained the purpose of the survey to the respondents, and informed consent was obtained from all participants before their involvement in the study. The participants were informed that they could choose to discontinue the interview at any point in time. Data Analysis The data from community-based surveys were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS 26.0 version. The categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages, and all continuous variables were represented as mean and standard deviations. Bivariate analysis was carried out to understand the significant association between dependent and independent variables. Those variables significantly associated with the dependent variables at p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 were entered into different regression models. Multivariable logistic? regression models were used to identify potential predictors of vaccination status and self-perceived accessibility to vaccination services. For the qualitative data, the transcripts were uploaded to Dedoose software, and thematic analysis was carried out by using a systematic process of reading the excerpts, coding, grouping codes, and identifying themes and sub-themes from the participant narratives. RESULTS A total of 1183 individuals participated in the community-based surveys conducted across three countries. The participants were distributed across the countries as follows: India - 398, Cambodia - 394, and the Philippines - 391. Most of the participants were females, at 84%, primarily because mothers and pregnant women serve as the primary caregivers for children in these communities. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 85 years old (mean age - 36) and about 2/3rd of them were from the age group of 18 to 35 years. The majority of the participants were married (80%) or practicing cohabiting or living together (12%). Table 1: Socio-demographic characteristics The qualitative study explored in-depth, the different facets of inequities faced by communities concerning vaccination as well as the role of climate change in exacerbating these inequities. A total of 71 in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with individuals who are caretakers of children eligible for vaccination, as well as key stakeholders from various departments like health, disaster response, Community leaders, PRIs, VHSNC members, etc. Table 2: Summary of Qualitative Interviews and Focus Group Discussions Participants Vaccination Awareness and access : The majority of the respondents (84%) were aware of the vaccination schedules in their countries. Among these respondents, community health workers emerged as the predominant source of information at 74%, followed by health centers and yellow cards (specific to Cambodia) at 39% and 20% respectively. However, only 5% of the participants reported channels like awareness campaigns as the primary source of information. Regarding vaccination status among children under 2 years old, 82% reported that their children were fully vaccinated, whereas 16% were partially vaccinated, leaving only 2% unvaccinated. Among those who reported having kids partially vaccinated or not vaccinated at all, the primary reasons reported were lack of awareness/information, fear of vaccines/side effects, lack of interest in vaccination, etc. 38% of the partial/unvaccinated status was due to children being scheduled for the next dose of vaccination. 84% of the respondents mentioned that their peers tend to miss vaccination with primary reasons being fear (65%), lack of awareness and information (23%), lack of vaccine availability (11%), disinterest (8%), and accessibility challenges (6%. Regarding the accessibility of overall vaccination services for children, 66% of respondents reported that it was (very) easy to access vaccination services, while around 10% found accessing these services to be (very) difficult. The survey data on vaccination sites revealed that 33% of the respondents attended sessions held at health centers, followed by 28% at schools, and 20% at Anganwadi centers. Additionally, the house of the village chief (exclusive for Cambodia) was another site where 12% of the respondents took vaccination. More than half of the participants mentioned that the nearest vaccination site was within a distance of less than 1 km, followed by 31% reporting that they had a vaccination site within 5 km from their residence. Respondents primarily relied on walking (57%) or using personal vehicles to reach the sites. More than 2/3rd of the study population reported that they faced one or the other challenges while accessing vaccination services. The top reasons cited were distance (44%), challenges due to extreme weather events (28%), unavailability of transport (27%), and physical constraints like ill-health (13%). About 42% of respondents mentioned that there was some recent outbreak of vaccine-preventable illness in the community. Some of the common outbreaks reported were Flu (64%) followed by chickenpox (43%), measles (17%), mumps (14%), and diarrhea (9%). In the context of HPV vaccination status in the Philippines and Cambodia, the survey revealed that 72% of respondents reported that their children have been fully vaccinated against HPV, while 22% stated they were not vaccinated, and 6% mentioned being partially vaccinated. Delving into the reasons behind the vaccination status, 59% of respondents cited fear as a factor, indicating apprehensions related to HPV vaccination. Additionally, 49% mentioned a lack of awareness and information as a barrier, suggesting a need for improved education and communication about the benefits and importance of HPV vaccination. A smaller proportion (9%) attributed their vaccination status to a lack of availability of the vaccine, highlighting potential challenges in accessing vaccination services. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions added depth to these findings, revealing community perceptions and behaviors over time. Access Challenges and Existing Inequities: Accessing vaccination services poses significant challenges for many individuals, as highlighted by the findings of both quantitative and qualitative data. More than two-thirds of the study population reported encountering obstacles in reaching vaccination sites. The primary challenges identified included geographical distance, with 44% of respondents citing it as a barrier. Additionally, extreme weather events were noted as a substantial hindrance, affecting 28% of participants. Furthermore, the unavailability of transport emerged as a significant challenge for 27% of respondents, indicating limitations in mobility that can impede access to healthcare services. Physical constraints, such as ill-health, were also reported by 13% of individuals, further exacerbating the difficulties in accessing vaccination. The qualitative data expands upon these challenges, providing deeper insights into the underlying factors contributing to difficulties in accessing vaccination services. One common issue echoed across all three countries was the difficulty in accessing vaccination services due to geographic location, particularly in remote areas. Extreme weather events, such as floods during rainy seasons, exacerbate these challenges by disrupting transport facilities, especially for vulnerable populations like newborn children and pregnant women. Financial difficulties compound these challenges, making it difficult for communities to access alternate measures like arranging paid transport. “During rainy seasons we can’t get there due to many reasons especially, transport-related, and vaccinations get canceled and then we have to go next time. Sometimes we do, sometimes, we don’t” - Brick Kiln &amp;amp; Migrant Community member FGD, Chattisgarh. “The challenge we encountered is that there are parts of Bagong Silangan that are quite remote. Although we have an outreach program and we visit them at least once a month for various services, the distance and size of the barangay pose challenges. The accessibility of patients to come is also a challenge” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines “If a woman is pregnant in the winter she gets the vaccination on time; in the rainy season, she does not get this vaccination as nurses don&amp;#x27;t visit here due to floods. We have to reserve a boat and take them to Mangaldoi. We have to offer someone tea too, we have to give the person Rs. 2000-3000 as rent. Those who can afford the rent get the vaccination on time, by traveling to Mangaldoi. Else, we don’t get the vaccines on time” - Community member FGD, Assam Cultural beliefs and individual perceptions also emerged as significant barriers to vaccination access. Misconceptions and fear surrounding vaccines lead to hesitancy among communities, preventing them from seeking vaccination and leaving them susceptible to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Knowledge gaps further exacerbate these challenges, as lack of information perpetuates misconceptions and hinders vaccination uptake. “People in the community listen to each other and they are afraid of the side effects of the vaccines. In addition, rumors from one person to another person are also a big issue. Furthermore, there were 3 doses provided to their children at the same time, so they were afraid of it. The side effects made their children not feel well such as fever after the injection. So they think that the health care provider makes their children sick” - Community Chief KII, Cambodia “Adverse weather events do not affect the vaccination and immunization services because they are existing interventions. However, it’s the health-seeking behavior of the people that is affected by weather events. Some parents do not allow their children to go out and be vaccinated during rainy days because they might get sick, like cough and colds, due to the bad weather” - City Health Officer KII, Philippines “When I asked them whether the child has been vaccinated, they said that no one has got it in our society, so how can we get vaccinated? They say that when the children get vaccinated they get a fever, their health deteriorates and the children cry and they cannot take care of the children in such situations” - Community member FGD, Chattisgarh Structural determinants, including systemic incapabilities in terms of supply, logistics, and human resources, also hinder access to vaccination services and perpetuate inequities among vulnerable communities. Limited vaccine supply, damaged infrastructure at health centers, and lack of support from authorities exacerbate these challenges, affecting the efficiency of vaccination campaigns and undermining community trust in the healthcare system. “Most seniors cannot avail of the vaccines and their vaccination is delayed especially for anti-flu because of the limited vaccine supply” - Community member FGD, Philippines “The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efficiency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “No, there is zero support in our area. Even the administration came and blamed us. No facilities are provided like boats, or life jackets during floods. Rather they scold us for not reaching on time”- Frontline Worker FGD, Assam Displacement and migration practices among communities pose additional challenges, as transient populations and frequent movement make it difficult for healthcare workers to ensure complete vaccination coverage. Vaccine-seeking behavior among communities also varies, with some exhibiting lackadaisical attitudes towards vaccination, further complicating efforts to achieve comprehensive vaccination coverage. “Awareness among the people like going to Anganwadi to get their children vaccinated is not that strong. The people of Bhansoj have become lazy, they think that this is a home delivery service, Mitanin will come to their home and they get vaccinated, hence people do not reach on their own to the vaccination centers” - Block medical officer KII, Chattisgarh “We are somewhat struggling with residents who frequently move. Many of them are just transient. In terms of scheduling vaccine appointments at the health center, it seems like it&amp;#x27;s not being followed. We are the ones who assist in locating residents who need to be vaccinated. When children are listed for vaccination and suddenly disappear, that&amp;#x27;s one problem” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Climate-induced disruptions to vaccination The study explored the populations’ awareness of climate change and its impact on health, livelihoods, and access to vaccination. A substantial proportion of respondents from Cambodia (92%), the Philippines (95%), and India (83%) confirmed experiencing changes in weather patterns in recent years. Across the surveyed countries, distinct weather events have shaped the experiences of participants. A higher proportion of the respondents from all the 3 countries indicated experiencing extreme heat. The second highest occurrence of distinct weather events was increased rainfall in the Philippines (74%), followed by floods in India at 34%, and cold waves and droughts (33%) in Cambodia. The majority of the respondents said that climate change negatively impacted their health, with common health problems during extreme weather events being fever (93%), respiratory illness (41%), weakness (38%), diarrheal illness (36%), dehydration (26%), skin diseases (23%), and heat stroke (16%). In addition to that, the changes in weather events significantly affected their lives. The top 5 areas that were impacted were livelihoods and income - 75%, access to clean water - 37%, child education - 35%, food crises - 33%, access to health services - 20%, and increased illness - 17%. Regarding vulnerability to climate change, 62% of respondents felt moderately/extremely vulnerable to climate change, while 13% felt slightly vulnerable or not vulnerable. Children (89%) were perceived as the most vulnerable, followed by the elderly (76%), pregnant and lactating women (46%), women (44%), and people with disabilities (20%). When exploring the interconnectedness between extreme weather events and access to vaccination, 43% indicated that extreme weather events have an impact on access to vaccination. The primary pathways of impact as reported by the participants were the poor condition of roads (45%), lack of transport facilities (44%), illness due to extreme weather (38%), non-functional health facilities (23%), increased side effects (21%), unavailability of staff (18%), and fear from ongoing community outbreaks (14%). Around 28% of the participants indicated that they did not get their children vaccinated during extreme weather events or due to climate change-led events.13% of respondents reported having migrated to the current location due to extreme weather events and climate change. Participant narratives revealed insights into the challenges faced by community members and systems due to disruptions caused by variations and extreme weather events, exacerbating existing inequities and vulnerabilities. A multitude of challenges affect the delivery of essential services like vaccination due to climate-led extreme weather events. The disruptions caused by weather events range from infrastructural damage of health facilities leading to difficulties in storage of vaccines and other basic services to complete damage of roads and lack of transportation making it impossible for health workers to reach community and individuals to reach facilities. Another concern that was discussed by providers and stakeholders across the 3 countries was the difficult conditions affecting travel and the safety of the frontline workers especially during extreme weather events which lead to disruptions in service delivery. “Service delivery has been significantly impacted due to the loss of road communication and transportation issues caused by extreme floods. The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efficiency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging. Additionally, the damage to cold chain points affects vaccine storage, leading to the loss of vaccines. At the community level, we see significant effects as communities struggle to access healthcare services.” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “Our climate change is more unpredictable now, especially when we have planned programs that can&amp;#x27;t be carried out on schedule anymore because when it&amp;#x27;s raining, fewer people come out. The struggle is also that we can&amp;#x27;t go to the communities. It’s dangerous to travel when the condition of the roads is not safe. Of course, the safety of health workers is important too” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines At the community level, disruptions were majorly around accessibility challenges faced by the community during EWE which had a strong bearing on their health-seeking behavior. Participant narratives were testimonies to the significant impact of climate change-led events like heavy rainfalls and floods on the administration of vaccines, especially for individuals living in remote locations. The participants also shared how the outbreak of climate-mediated health outbreaks led to a delay in the uptake of vaccination which would have a further significant negative impact on the health of populations, especially pregnant mothers and children. “In the season of a flood, ANM/nurses can&amp;#x27;t visit us till the water completely gets dried up from the roads. It&amp;#x27;s been almost one or two months that they haven’t visited us. We don&amp;#x27;t get vaccinations on time. When the vaccine comes we still have to visit the town to get that, even in case of emergency vaccination we have to visit the town for this” - Community member FGD, Assam “The challenges arise in the administration and distribution of vaccines due to diseases that emerge from changing weather conditions. When children have a fever, parents hesitate to bring them for vaccination, and we must wait until the child recovers. This affects the intervals of vaccination administration. Water and airborne diseases linked to climate change, such as a rise in diarrhea cases, also impact parents&amp;#x27; confidence in bringing their children for immunization. They fear that vaccination might lead to fever” - Frontline Worker FGD, Philippines “No, we were not vaccinated at that time, there is a high number of child deaths in Chapari areas because they have not been vaccinated at the proper time, there is a high mortality ratio of old people, and due to lack of timely vaccination on time like the smallpox vaccine, we suffer from smallpox too here. And the children die because of this” - Community Members FGD, Assam “In the case of delivery of a Pregnant woman, the mother has to give birth on the road, in various cases the mother dies or sometimes the baby dies in the mother’s womb. We are poor people, we don&amp;#x27;t have enough savings to afford to go to the hospital” - Community Members, Assam While the vaccination services are mostly provided free of cost, there were instances of financial difficulties affecting the uptake of health services in general and vaccination among participants. Many of them reported how extreme weather events affect their livelihoods and disrupt earnings which lead them to deprioritise basic services like vaccination. “When it&amp;#x27;s raining heavily or there&amp;#x27;s a typhoon, people can&amp;#x27;t go out. Livelihoods are affected, especially during the hot and then rainy seasons. I haven&amp;#x27;t experienced it myself, just observed. Instead of having additional income from their spouse&amp;#x27;s job, it disappears as everyone is stuck at home. So they hesitate, even when there is sickness. They wait” - Community Members FGD, Philippines “Most of the people of the region live on agriculture, so when natural disasters like floods occur, in the flood season, crops are damaged and people are forced to live with a lot of risks including not seeking healthcare” - Community Members FGD, Chattisgarh Adaptations and coping strategies This theme brings the spotlight on practices adopted by community and service providers, to cope with climate change-induced events. The narratives from both community and stakeholders will provide a detailed understanding of the resilience demonstrated by the systems and communities irrespective of the challenges posed by the extreme weather events and how that ensured the continuity of essential services in addition to providing relief measures. While there have been challenges that hindered the system from achieving complete vaccination in all 3 countries, due to existing vulnerabilities and climate-induced impacts; the participants also shared some significant measures adopted by individuals as well as the system actors to address these challenges. To ensure there was continued access to vaccination irrespective of the weather-imposed challenges, service providers across all countries adopted innovative measures like strategic phasing of door-to-door visits for improved access, catch-up sessions, and regular follow-up for reminders. “Regular reminders about upcoming immunization schedules are provided, and if they can&amp;#x27;t attend during the set date, they are included in catch-up sessions facilitated by NDP or midwives. Parents who miss the initial schedule due to rain or other reasons become part of the catch-up, usually held a few days later. If parents still don&amp;#x27;t comply, we schedule another day or month and persistently remind them.”- Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Intersectoral collaboration played a crucial role in building systemic resilience by effectively responding to crises, adapting to variations in climate, and addressing complex health challenges. Having a strong functional response system that works hand in hand with health and other departments also seemed to be crucial in uninterrupted services, especially during crises. Involving and empowering local leaders to address challenges of hesitancy among communities helped build trust and improved the uptake of vaccination services among communities. Another unique strategy that was used, was to identify women champions from the community itself to ensure that no one was left behind from the vaccination services. “In some cases, the patient wants to take the vaccine however, another person is showing resistance. If there are any such issues we discuss this in VHSNC meeting and we take the help of the leaders to make them understand, post which there is almost always an increase in the turn out of members for the drives” - Frontline worker FGD, Assam “There was a significant Muslim community in one barangay that was hard to reach. What worked was having someone well-versed in explanations and a representative from the institution. At that time, we had a highly effective Nurse Deployment Project (NDP), and with the assistance of a barangay kagawad, we were able to successfully persuade the community” - Frontline Workers, Tabaco City “Now we have even made women secretaries and presidents, they did the vaccination in homes in their respective areas. They go around and see how many people have been vaccinated, need to be vaccinated, and what is the population, and how many ladies are pregnant. How many 5-year-old children are there and after keeping complete data of everyone, they will tell you when you will get vaccinated and when will you have to go. It means a lot and is much better than earlier. No pregnant lady is left unvaccinated and is not prone to any diseases or illness.” - Community influencers, Chattisgarh “During the rainy season, our community health workers will be the ones to gather information on their assigned area. We also prepared a set of medicines we give to BHERT and the 24/7 lying-in so that in case the health center is closed, the resident can still avail it. In addition, it is the BHW who will go house-to-house and facilitate the provision of health services to those who need it.” - Community member FGD, Philippines A strategy that was unique to the Philippines, was the incentivization of immunization-seeking behavior by tying them with health and other services available from the health center. Consistent and diligent efforts to make the community aware of the importance of vaccination and to dispel any myths and misconceptions also played a crucial role in ensuring the delivery of on-time services. In addition to this, awareness activities were also carried out on the impact of climate change, disease surge, and climate-mediated health outcomes as well. “Previously, during immunization campaigns, we had to visit households to inform parents about their children&amp;#x27;s immunization needs, after which they would bring their children to the Barangay Health Station (BHS). However, with the establishment of the Barangay Health Center, now, when there&amp;#x27;s a scheduled immunization session, parents voluntarily bring their children to the Barangay Health Center. This is because if they attempt to obtain any certifications from the barangay, they will be denied due to their non-compliance with bringing their child for immunization. Failure to comply means you won&amp;#x27;t receive certifications or assistance from the barangay until you adhere to the immunization schedule. This approach ensures that residents understand the importance of immunization and encourages compliance. It also allows us to hold back assistance, such as during gift-giving events until they comply with the immunization schedule or any other health-related activities where their cooperation is required” - Frontline Workers FGD, Philippines “The effect of weather change affects the trend of vaccination among communities. The people don’t come for vaccination during the extreme heat. So we hold sessions to inform them on what can be done to deal with some of the side effects. We also give them examples from previous years, like the measles outbreak. We educate them on what will happen when they don’t vaccinate their kids; like if you don’t go to the sub-centre your child will not get vitamin A, and there is a chance of disability and eye disease.It may seem like it’s scary, but they understand and then they attend the camps” - Frontline Worker FGD, Chhattisgarh It was also discussed how communities and stakeholders recognized the importance of preserving the ecosystem and environment in building resilient communities, especially in the wake of increasing disasters. Participants shared how a voluntary culture of environment conservation was practiced to prevent and mitigate the effects of any future disasters and outbreaks. “Recently, we conducted a tree planting activity with the schoolchildren to help mitigate the effects of climate change like flooding. We also educate people on the effects of use of Styrofoam to the ozone (layer). We also inform them about the importance of proper disposal so that the canals aren’t clogged up by trash” - Community Member, Bagong Silangan “The barangay has tree planting activities in Sitio Bakal. These activities are coordinated by the DENR and involve NGOs. We&amp;#x27;ve also been able to engage high school students through partnerships with schools.&amp;quot; We banned cutting of trees in our area because there are very few of them left. Our mountainous place is prone to disasters. We prohibit tree cutting” - Community Member, Baguio Measures for better preparedness This theme summarises the efforts undertaken in all 3 countries towards preparing for climate variability and disaster response mechanisms to ensure continuity of services, especially essential services like vaccination highlighting both successes and areas for improvement. While frontline workers across various locations reported well-functioning health facilities and response teams, there needs to be more coordination, training, and resource allocation as indicated by the participant narratives. There were indications from health workers as well as representatives of the beneficiary groups that having dedicated resources is crucial to ensuring continuity of services, especially during extreme weather events and disasters. The narratives also indicated that building the capacity of the frontline workers and responders was imperative to the effectiveness and success of any response and service delivery. “There should be a policy to ensure enough hiring of sufficient healthcare staff to augment the workforce. Even one health staff per barangay is good. Right now, they can be pulled out anytime because they are not permanent. In my opinion, someone should be manning the cold chain facility and health services. Someone should be assigned there anytime so we’re ready once a typhoon hits. The health workers must also work consistently. There should not be delays. If the vaccine is available, it should be given to the target and prioritized clients. There should also be an appeal to orient the barangay council so that they can also help with this” - Frontline workers FGD, Philippines “During the flood, we have a dedicated team, trained. Despite their training, there are still areas where the team lacks effectiveness, indicating room for improvement in disaster response strategies and coordination” - Medical Officer KII, Assam Participants spoke at length regarding the overall need to improve the social determinants of health including access to healthcare in general which has a significant impact on the overall health-seeking behavior of communities and more so during variations in climate patterns. The respondents also indicated that there have to be systematic processes in place to ensure that there is an adequate supply of vaccines at the facilities to meet the demands of the communities&amp;#x27; post-awareness campaigns and such. There have been multiple instances when frontline workers reported that individuals didn’t receive vaccines even after they reached facilities as communicated by the frontline workers, which further affected the trust of the communities in the system. “First, for health, we need a health sub-center. We need a hospital, we need a readily available doctor that we can consult anytime if we feel sick, and we need a medical store too, so that we can easily access the medicines we need. Next, we need a bridge over the river at Gadhua Ghat, we need access to electricity as well, an Anganwadi center, we need better farming equipment from the government because most of the villagers are farmers. We need training on how to stay healthy, how to take care of kids, how to keep them away from diseases, and how to wash hands, we need training on this. We need everything, they promised to give everything when they came asking for the vote, but after the election, they forgot their promises. We need many things but if they fulfill basic needs we can live a better life. You want us to attend camps, I can’t do anything without this” - Community member FGD, Assam, India “The vaccine supply at the health center is limited. How can we provide vaccines to constituents if the supply is limited? Even if you educate them, if there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine available at the center, they will get upset. Especially during COVID-19, they always said that they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be accepted at the hospital without a vaccine. We endorse it and then there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine. Even for students, it&amp;#x27;s the same, they need a vaccine card to enter. So when they rushed to get vaccinated, there wasn&amp;#x27;t enough vaccine in the barangay. So, let&amp;#x27;s look at the gaps, what&amp;#x27;s lacking, like the shortage of supply. Perhaps this should be brought to the attention of higher authorities that these gaps need attention in the community for better services” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Stakeholders across the countries thought that an integrated plan involving stakeholders from multiple departments would be instrumental in an effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services like vaccination. Another factor cited to be most critical to the success of complete immunization and efficient service delivery was the use of data and rigorous MIS and reporting systems that help understand the gaps and plan better. “Collaborative efforts between various stakeholders will be crucial in addressing the evolving challenges effectively. Collaborating with other departments can ensure essential equipment such as boats and life jackets are available during relief efforts. Furthermore, in partnership with the health department, we supply necessary medications and provide care to most affected communities. This collaborative effort ensures that the most vulnerable receive necessary care and support during times of crisis: - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “We need to improve the reporting system to ensure that success indicators are truthful, such as comparing the projected population with the actual population reached. This is crucial for the success of vaccination efforts” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Determinants of vaccine uptake and access From further analysis, it was also seen that as age advances, the respondents tend to have fully vaccinated their kids compared to those who are younger. It was also identified that respondents who are self-employed/in business and are doing salaried work are significantly more likely to fully vaccinate their children compared to farmers/dependent on agriculture and daily labor. None of the other socio-demographic factors seem to be significantly associated with vaccination status. Being aware of the vaccination schedule seems to be significantly associated with full vaccination status compared to those who are not aware. Another factor that influences the vaccination status is the perceived access to vaccination. Individuals who perceive difficulty in accessing vaccination are significantly associated with a higher proportion of children being partially vaccinated or unvaccinated. In line with existing evidence, facing challenges while accessing vaccination is significantly associated with a higher proportion of respondents reporting partial vaccination status compared to a higher proportion of full vaccination status among those reporting no challenges. Similarly, distance from the vaccination site was another factor that significantly influenced vaccination status. A significantly high proportion of thThe analysis of the qualitative data from the 3 countries is summarized in 4 themes as listed below: The respondents who live closer to the vaccination sites (less than or equal to 5 km) reported complete vaccination status compared to those who live far from the vaccination sites. Findings from interviews and discussions with stakeholders and communities The qualitative study explored in-depth, the different facets of inequities faced by communities concerning vaccination as well as the role of climate change in exacerbating these inequities. A total of 71 in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with individuals who are caretakers of children eligible for vaccination, as well as key stakeholders from various departments like health, disaster response, Community leaders, PRIs, VHSNC members, etc. Risks and Vulnerabilities Climate-induced disruptions to service delivery and access Health system resilience and adaptations Preparedness and planning Risks and Vulnerabilities This theme details the existing challenges experienced by communities which makes them more vulnerable to the inequities and puts them at an increased risk for negative impacts induced by and related to climate. Participants from the community discussed how the challenges that exist in terms of access to healthcare, socio-economic status, cultural beliefs, built environment, and geographical location impact their health, livelihoods, and overall well-being drastically. This theme is further broken down to explain the inequities and vulnerabilities at different levels - individual, system, and community/geography. A common challenge echoed by participants across all countries was the difficulty in accessing vaccination services due to their location. Many of them shared that residing in remote areas critically affects their ability to get vaccinated and access other health services despite the efforts from healthcare providers trying to reach them. The challenges are particularly exacerbated with extreme weather events like floods during rainy seasons when the transport facilities also get affected especially for newborn children and pregnant women. The geographical constraints combined with financial difficulties also make it difficult for communities to resort to alternate measures like arranging paid transport, etc. “During rainy seasons we can’t get there due to many reasons especially, transport-related, and vaccinations get canceled and then we have to go next time. Sometimes we do, sometimes, we don’t” - Brick Kiln a&amp;amp; Migrant Community member FGD, Chattisgarh. “The challenge we encountered is that there are parts of Bagong Silangan that are quite remote. Although we have an outreach program and we visit them at least once a month for various services, the distance and size of the barangay pose challenges. The accessibility of patients to come is also a challenge” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines “If a woman is pregnant in the winter she gets the vaccination on time; in the rainy season, she does not get this vaccination as nurses don&amp;#x27;t visit here due to floods. We have to reserve a boat and take them to Mangaldoi. We have to offer someone tea too, we have to give the person Rs. 2000-3000 as rent. Those who can afford the rent get the vaccination on time, by travelling to Mandaldoi. Else, we don’t get the vaccines on time” - Community member FGD, Assam Another common issue that emerged across all 3 countries was the cultural beliefs and individual perceptions that made them hesitant towards and prevented them from accessing vaccination which makes them susceptible to illnesses and has led to outbreaks in the community. The knowledge gap is another key challenge that critically affects and compounds existing inequities as lack of information leads to misconceptions and prevents them from accessing vaccination. The narratives from the stakeholder interviews also indicate that there is a fear among communities to let their children be vaccinated during extreme weather events due to possible illness and injury. “People in the community listen to each other and they are afraid of the side effects of the vaccines. In addition, rumors from one person to another people also a big issue. Furthermore, there were 3 dozes provided to their children at the same time, so they were afraid of it. The side effects made their children not feel well such as fever after the injection. So they think that the health care provider makes their children sick” - Community Chief KII, Cambodia “Adverse weather events do not affect the vaccination and immunization services because they are existing interventions. However, it’s the health-seeking behavior of the people that is affected by weather events. Some parents do not allow their children to go out and be vaccinated during rainy days because they might get sick, like cough and colds, due to the bad weather” - City Health Officer KII, Philippines “When I asked them whether the child has been vaccinated, they said that no one has got it in our society, so how can we get vaccinated? They say that when the children get vaccinated they get a fever, their health deteriorates and the children cry and they cannot take care of the children in such situations” - Community member FGD, Chattisgarh Challenges with structural determinants like systemic incapabilities in terms of supply, logistics, HR, and capacities also hindered access to vaccination and perpetuated inequity among the communities that are already vulnerable. These kinds of challenges affect the efficiency of services and affect the trust of the communities in the system making them hesitant to receive services. Another concern was the lack of support from the authorities in addressing the existing concerns and providing adequate relief in the event of a crisis in the community. “Most seniors cannot avail of the vaccines and their vaccination is delayed especially for anti-flu because of the limited vaccine supply” - Community member FGD, Philippines “The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efficiency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “No, there is zero support in our area. Even the administration came and blamed us. No facilities are provided like boats, or life jackets during floods. Rather they scold us for not reaching on time”- Frontline Worker FGD, Assam The interviews with key stakeholders also revealed another dimension of challenges concerning complete vaccination among communities. Participants shared their experience of communities being lackadaisical when it comes to vaccine-seeking behavior which sometimes becomes a roadblock. Another key concern that was echoed across the countries was the displacement and migration practices among communities. This posed a two-way challenge making it difficult for healthcare workers to vaccinate these families as well as the children and other eligible members getting missed out from the vaccination programs due to moving from one place to another. “Awareness among the people like going to Anganwadi to get their children vaccinated is not that strong. The people of Bhansoj have become lazy, they think that this is a home delivery service, Mitanin will come to their home and they get vaccinated, hence people do not reach on their own to the vaccination centers” - Block medical officer KII, Chattisgarh “We are somewhat struggling with residents who frequently move. Many of them are just transient. In terms of scheduling vaccine appointments at the health center, it seems like it&amp;#x27;s not being followed. We are the ones who assist in locating residents who need to be vaccinated. When children are listed for vaccination and suddenly disappear, that&amp;#x27;s one problem” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Climate-induced disruptions to service delivery and access This theme discusses the challenges faced by community members and systems due to the disruptions caused by variations and extreme weather events and how that magnifies existing inequities and makes the communities more vulnerable. The participant narratives are described at 2 levels - systemic and community. A multitude of challenges affect the delivery of essential services like vaccination due to climate-led extreme weather events. The disruptions caused by weather events range from infrastructural damage of health facilities leading to difficulties in storage of vaccines and other basic services to complete damage of roads and lack of transportation making it impossible for health workers to reach community and individuals to reach facilities.

The people don’t come for vaccination during the extreme heat. So we hold sessions to inform them on what can be done to deal with some of the side effects. We also give them examples from previous years, like the measles outbreak. We educate them on what will happen when they don’t vaccinate their kids; like if you don’t go to the sub-centre your child will not get vitamin A, and there is a chance of disability and eye disease.It may seem like it’s scary, but they understand and then they attend the camps” - Frontline Worker FGD, Chhattisgarh It was also discussed how communities and stakeholders recognized the importance of preserving the ecosystem and environment in building resilient communities, especially in the wake of increasing disasters. Participants shared how a voluntary culture of environment conservation was practiced to prevent and mitigate the effects of any future disasters and outbreaks. “Recently, we conducted a tree planting activity with the schoolchildren to help mitigate the effects of climate change like flooding. We also educate people on the effects of use of Styrofoam to the ozone (layer). We also inform them about the importance of proper disposal so that the canals aren’t clogged up by trash” - Community Member, Bagong Silangan “The barangay has tree planting activities in Sitio Bakal. These activities are coordinated by the DENR and involve NGOs. We&amp;#x27;ve also been able to engage high school students through partnerships with schools.&amp;quot; We banned cutting of trees in our area because there are very few of them left. Our mountainous place is prone to disasters. We prohibit tree cutting” - Community Member, Baguio Measures for better preparedness and planning This theme summarises the efforts undertaken in all 3 countries towards preparing for climate variability and disaster response mechanisms to ensure continuity of services, especially essential services like vaccination highlighting both successes and areas for improvement. While frontline workers across various locations reported well-functioning health facilities and response teams, there needs to be more coordination, training, and resource allocation as indicated by the participant narratives. There were indications from health workers as well as representatives of the beneficiary groups that having dedicated resources is crucial to ensuring continuity of services, especially during extreme weather events and disasters. The narratives also indicated that building the capacity of the frontline workers and responders was imperative to the effectiveness and success of any response and service delivery. “There should be a policy to ensure enough hiring of sufficient healthcare staff to augment the workforce. Even one health staff per barangay is good. Right now, they can be pulled out anytime because they are not permanent. In my opinion, someone should be manning the cold chain facility and health services. Someone should be assigned there anytime so we’re ready once a typhoon hits. The health workers must also work consistently. There should not be delays. If the vaccine is available, it should be given to the target and prioritized clients. There should also be an appeal to orient the barangay council so that they can also help with this” - Frontline workers FGD, Philippines “During the flood, we have a dedicated team, trained. Despite their training, there are still areas where the team lacks effectiveness, indicating room for improvement in disaster response strategies and coordination” - Medical Officer KII, Assam Participants spoke at length regarding the overall need to improve the social determinants of health including access to healthcare in general which has a significant impact on the overall health-seeking behavior of communities and more so during variations in climate patterns. The respondents also indicated that there have to be systematic processes in place to ensure that there is an adequate supply of vaccines at the facilities to meet the demands of the communities&amp;#x27; post-awareness campaigns and such. There have been multiple instances when frontline workers reported that individuals didn’t receive vaccines even after they reached facilities as communicated by the frontline workers, which further affected the trust of the communities in the system. “First, for health, we need a health sub-center. We need a hospital, we need a readily available doctor that we can consult anytime if we feel sick, and we need a medical store too, so that we can easily access the medicines we need. Next, we need a bridge over the river at Gadhua Ghat, we need access to electricity as well, an Anganwadi center, we need better farming equipment from the government because most of the villagers are farmers. We need training on how to stay healthy, how to take care of kids, how to keep them away from diseases, and how to wash hands, we need training on this. We need everything, they promised to give everything when they came asking for the vote, but after the election, they forgot their promises. We need many things but if they fulfill basic needs we can live a better life. You want us to attend camps, I can’t do anything without this” - Community member FGD, Assam, India “The vaccine supply at the health center is limited. How can we provide vaccines to constituents if the supply is limited? Even if you educate them, if there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine available at the center, they will get upset. Especially during COVID-19, they always said that they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be accepted at the hospital without a vaccine. We endorse it and then there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine. Even for students, it&amp;#x27;s the same, they need a vaccine card to enter. So when they rushed to get vaccinated, there wasn&amp;#x27;t enough vaccine in the barangay. So, let&amp;#x27;s look at the gaps, what&amp;#x27;s lacking, like the shortage of supply. Perhaps this should be brought to the attention of higher authorities that these gaps need attention in the community for better services” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Stakeholders across the countries thought that an integrated plan involving stakeholders from multiple departments would be instrumental in an effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services like vaccination. Another factor cited to be most critical to the success of complete immunization and efficient service delivery was the use of data and rigorous MIS and reporting systems that help understand the gaps and plan better. “Collaborative efforts between various stakeholders will be crucial in addressing the evolving challenges effectively. Collaborating with other departments can ensure essential equipment such as boats and life jackets are available during relief efforts. Furthermore, in partnership with the health department, we supply necessary medications and provide care to most affected communities. This collaborative effort ensures that the most vulnerable receive necessary care and support during times of crisis: - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “We need to improve the reporting system to ensure that success indicators are truthful, such as comparing the projected population with the actual population reached. This is crucial for the success of vaccination efforts” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines DISCUSSION Climate change poses an unparalleled threat to humanity through direct pathways like temperature rise, altered patterns of precipitation as well as extreme weather events like droughts, floods, heat waves, etc. The climate-induced events can also impact human health negatively through indirect pathways by causing population displacement and disrupting access to health services, water, sanitation, and hygiene to cite a few examples. The findings from this mixed methods study on vaccine inequity and climate change among vulnerable groups in these 3 countries highlighted the current status of vaccine access, what drives access and nuanced interplay between climate change and vaccine inequity among vulnerable populations, and how it tested the resilience of communities and health systems. While the surveys highlighted that the majority of the participants were aware of the age-appropriate vaccination schedule and reported high vaccination rates among children, there were significant challenges to vaccination access like distance from the centers, extreme weather events, unavailability of transport, and illness. In addition to accessibility challenges, factors like fear of vaccines and side effects, and lack of awareness of vaccine availability contribute to partial or non-vaccination of children leading to vaccine-preventable illnesses and possible outbreaks in the communities they live in. The proximity of vaccination sites and the ease of access play crucial roles in vaccination uptake, emphasizing the need for decentralized and easily accessible vaccination services, especially in remote areas. Addressing fear using systematic information and building trust is another key factor in addressing hesitancy and improving vaccine uptake among the most vulnerable as evident in the existing literature. The findings from the community-based surveys as well as discussions and interviews with the key stakeholders outlined the role of climate change in exacerbating existing inequities affecting livelihoods and other social determinants of health like access to healthcare, education, etc. Extreme weather events cause a double burden by disrupting service delivery, causing delays in vaccination, and leading to an increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable illnesses as well as an increase in climate-mediated health issues. Subsets of the populations that are much more vulnerable like pregnant women, the elderly, and children are disproportionately affected and bear the brunt of these impacts, warranting the need for targeted interventions to minimize the effects and mitigate them faster for better resilience. The study also captured mechanisms adopted by the communities and administration to improve vaccination services in general and cope with the impact of climate change. Strategies to take services to the doorstep of communities, encourage community participation, and build their knowledge through targeted campaigns seemed to motivate communities and improve their access to vaccination despite weather-related challenges. Additionally, the findings also indicated that intersectoral collaboration and coordination, efficient planning, and resource allocation are important to ensure effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services which build resilience of the most vulnerable populations. NEW RESULTS SECTION: A total of 1,183 individuals participated in community-based surveys conducted across three countries. The distribution of these participants was as follows: India (398 participants), Cambodia (394 participants), and the Philippines (391 participants). The mean age of participants is 36 years (S.D 11.2), with 80% aged younger than 45 years. The majority of the participants were female (84%) and married (80%) or practicing cohabiting or living together (12%).Less than half of the participants (47.3%) were highly literate, while nearly 85.2% had at least some formal schooling.The occupation data revealed that 34% of the participants were unemployed, while 27% were engaged in farming or agriculture-related activities. The most common household size was more than four individuals (63.6%), and the majority of households (62.3%) were located in rural areas. Access to WASH facilities was reflected in 70% of households having access to safe drinking water and 81% having access to sanitation facilities.Demographic data are presented in Table 1. A total of 71 in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to explore the different facets of inequities faced by communities concerning vaccination and the role of climate change in exacerbating these inequities. The participants included individuals who are caretakers of children eligible for vaccination, as well as key stakeholders from various departments such as health, disaster response, community leaders, PRIs, and VHSNC members. In India, 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with frontline workers, 6 key informant interviews (KIIs) with medical officers, 2 KIIs with district disaster control unit officials, and 12 FGDs with community representatives. In the Philippines, 3 KIIs were conducted with local disaster control unit officials, 3 KIIs with medical officers, 9 FGDs with health workers (Barangay Health workers, etc.), and 9 FGDs with community representatives. In Cambodia, 5 KIIs were conducted with the local/provincial disaster control unit officials, and 10 KIIs with medical officers detailed in Table 2. The key themes under which the qualitative findings are summarized are presented along with the survey results below. Vaccination Awareness and Accessibility: The majority of respondents (84%) were aware of the vaccination schedules in their countries. Of the respondents, 53 %community health workers emerged as the predominant source of information, followed by health centers (39%) and yellow cards (specific to Cambodia) at 20%, respectively. However, only 5% of the participants reported channels like awareness campaigns as their primary source of information.Out of these respondents the vaccination status of children under 2 years old, 82% reported that their children were fully vaccinated, whereas 16% were partially vaccinated, leaving only 2% unvaccinated. Among 16% who reported having children partially vaccinated or unvaccinated, the primary reasons included lack of awareness/information, fear of vaccines/side effects, and lack of interest in vaccination. Additionally, 38% of the partial or unvaccinated status was due to children being scheduled for their next dose of vaccination. Regarding their peers, 84% of respondents mentioned that missed vaccinations were primarily due to fear (65%), followed by lack of awareness and information (23%), lack of vaccine availability (11%), disinterest (8%), and accessibility challenges (6%). The overall accessibility of vaccination services for children, reported that it was (very) easy to access vaccination services 66%, while around 10% found accessing these services to be (very) difficult. The survey data on vaccination sites revealed that 33% of the respondents attended sessions held at health centers, followed by 28% at schools, and 20% at Anganwadi centers. Additionally, the house of the village chief (exclusive for Cambodia) was another site where 12% of the respondents took vaccination. More than half of the participants mentioned that the nearest vaccination site was within a distance of less than 1 km, followed by 31% reporting that they had a vaccination site within 5 km from their residence. Respondents primarily relied on walking (57%) or using personal vehicles to reach the sites. Over 28%of the participants in the survey stated that they had challenges in getting immunisations.The most common reasons cited were distance (44%), challenges due to extreme weather events (28%), unavailability of transport (27%), and physical constraints like ill-health (13%). About 42% of respondents mentioned that there was some recent outbreak of vaccine-preventable illness in the community. Some of the common outbreaks reported were Flu (64%) followed by chickenpox (43%), measles (17%), mumps (14%), and diarrhea (9%). In the context of HPV vaccination status in the Philippines and Cambodia, 72% of respondents reported that their children have been fully vaccinated, while 22% stated they were not vaccinated, and 6% mentioned being partially vaccinated. The key barriers behind the HPV vaccination status reported that 59% of respondents cited fear as a factor. Additionally, 49% mentioned a lack of awareness and information. A smaller proportion (9%) attributed their vaccination status to a lack of availability of the vaccine, highlighting potential challenges in accessing vaccination services. The qualitative data expands upon the survey findings, providing deeper insights into the underlying factors contributing to vaccine awareness and accessibility. Community perceptions and behaviors have evolved significantly over time, highlighting both improvements and ongoing challenges in vaccination efforts. One recurring theme is the historical hesitancy and resistance towards vaccination, which has gradually diminished due to persistent community education and engagement. This shift in attitude is echoed by community members who noted significant health improvements in children due to vaccinations. &amp;quot;It is very beneficial; it is not like in earlier times when children used to get sick and remained weak. Children are healthy today, there is no problem.&amp;quot;Community member FGD, Philippines &amp;quot;Now they have come to know that not taking the vaccine is harmful for our body. We tell these people that if they don&amp;#x27;t get vaccinated, they will become disabled.&amp;quot;Community member FGD,Cambodia Access Challenges and Existing Inequities: Accessing vaccination services poses significant challenges for many individuals, as highlighted by the findings of both quantitative and qualitative data. More than two-thirds of the study population reported encountering obstacles in reaching vaccination sites. The primary challenges identified included geographical distance, with 44% of respondents citing it as a barrier. Additionally, extreme weather events were noted as a substantial hindrance, affecting 28% of participants. Furthermore, the unavailability of transport emerged as a significant challenge for 27% of respondents, indicating limitations in mobility that can impede access to healthcare services. Physical constraints, such as ill-health, were also reported by 13% of individuals, further exacerbating the difficulties in accessing vaccination. The qualitative data expands upon these challenges, providing deeper insights into the underlying factors contributing to difficulties in accessing vaccination services. One common issue echoed across all three countries was the difficulty in accessing vaccination services due to geographic location, particularly in remote areas. Extreme weather events, such as floods during rainy seasons, exacerbate these challenges by disrupting transport facilities, especially for vulnerable populations like newborn children and pregnant women. Financial difficulties compound these challenges, making it difficult for communities to access alternate measures like arranging paid transport. “During rainy seasons we can’t get there due to many reasons especially, transport-related, and vaccinations get canceled and then we have to go next time. Sometimes we do, sometimes, we don’t” - Brick Kiln &amp;amp; Migrant Community member FGD, Chattisgarh. “The challenge we encountered is that there are parts of Bagong Silangan that are quite remote. Although we have an outreach program and we visit them at least once a month for various services, the distance and size of the barangay pose challenges. The accessibility of patients to come is also a challenge” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines “If a woman is pregnant in the winter she gets the vaccination on time; in the rainy season, she does not get this vaccination as nurses don&amp;#x27;t visit here due to floods. We have to reserve a boat and take them to Mangaldoi. We have to offer someone tea too, we have to give the person Rs. 2000-3000 as rent. Those who can afford the rent get the vaccination on time, by traveling to Mangaldoi. Else, we don’t get the vaccines on time” - Community member FGD, Assam Cultural beliefs and individual perceptions also emerged as significant barriers to vaccination access. Misconceptions and fear surrounding vaccines lead to hesitancy among communities, preventing them from seeking vaccination and leaving them susceptible to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Knowledge gaps further exacerbate these challenges, as lack of information perpetuates misconceptions and hinders vaccination uptake. “People in the community listen to each other and they are afraid of the side effects of the vaccines. In addition, rumors from one person to another person are also a big issue. Furthermore, there were 3 doses provided to their children at the same time, so they were afraid of it. The side effects made their children not feel well such as fever after the injection. So they think that the health care provider makes their children sick” - Community Chief KII, Cambodia “Adverse weather events do not affect the vaccination and immunization services because they are existing interventions. However, it’s the health-seeking behavior of the people that is affected by weather events. Some parents do not allow their children to go out and be vaccinated during rainy days because they might get sick, like cough and colds, due to the bad weather” - City Health Officer KII, Philippines “When I asked them whether the child has been vaccinated, they said that no one has got it in our society, so how can we get vaccinated? They say that when the children get vaccinated they get a fever, their health deteriorates and the children cry and they cannot take care of the children in such situations” - Community member FGD, Chattisgarh Structural determinants, including systemic incapabilities in terms of supply, logistics, and human resources, also hinder access to vaccination services and perpetuate inequities among vulnerable communities. Limited vaccine supply, damaged infrastructure at health centers, and lack of support from authorities exacerbate these challenges, affecting the efficiency of vaccination campaigns and undermining community trust in the healthcare system. “Most seniors cannot avail of the vaccines and their vaccination is delayed especially for anti-flu because of the limited vaccine supply” - Community member FGD, Philippines “The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efficiency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “No, there is zero support in our area. Even the administration came and blamed us. No facilities are provided like boats, or life jackets during floods. Rather they scold us for not reaching on time”- Frontline Worker FGD, Assam Displacement and migration practices among communities pose additional challenges, as transient populations and frequent movement make it difficult for healthcare workers to ensure complete vaccination coverage. Vaccine-seeking behavior among communities also varies, with some exhibiting lackadaisical attitudes towards vaccination, further complicating efforts to achieve comprehensive vaccination coverage. “Awareness among the people like going to Anganwadi to get their children vaccinated is not that strong. The people of Bhansoj have become lazy, they think that this is a home delivery service, Mitanin will come to their home and they get vaccinated, hence people do not reach on their own to the vaccination centers” - Block medical officer KII, Chattisgarh “We are somewhat struggling with residents who frequently move. Many of them are just transient. In terms of scheduling vaccine appointments at the health center, it seems like it&amp;#x27;s not being followed. We are the ones who assist in locating residents who need to be vaccinated. When children are listed for vaccination and suddenly disappear, that&amp;#x27;s one problem” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Climate-induced disruptions to vaccination The study examined the awareness of climate change and its effects on health, livelihoods, and vaccination access among populations. A substantial proportion of respondents from Cambodia (92%), the Philippines (95%), and India (83%) confirmed experiencing changes in weather patterns in recent years. Across the surveyed countries, distinct weather events have markedly influenced participants&amp;#x27; experiences. A higher proportion of respondents from all three countries reported experiencing extreme heat. The second most frequently reported distinct weather event was increased rainfall in the Philippines (74%), followed by floods in India (34%), and cold waves and droughts in Cambodia (33%). The majority of respondents indicated that climate change had adversely affected their health. Common health issues during extreme weather events included fever (93%), respiratory illness (41%), weakness (38%), diarrheal illness (36%), dehydration (26%), skin diseases (23%), and heat stroke (16%). Additionally, these weather changes significantly impacted various aspects of their lives. The top five affected areas were livelihoods and income (75%), access to clean water (37%), child education (35%), food crises (33%), access to health services (20%), and increased illness (17%). Regarding vulnerability to climate change, 62% of respondents felt moderately/extremely vulnerable to climate change, while 13% felt slightly vulnerable or not vulnerable. Children (89%) were perceived as the most vulnerable, followed by the elderly (76%), pregnant and lactating women (46%), women (44%), and people with disabilities (20%). When exploring the interconnectedness between extreme weather events and access to vaccination, 43% indicated that extreme weather events have an impact on access to vaccination. The primary pathways of impact as reported by the participants were the poor condition of roads (45%), lack of transport facilities (44%), illness due to extreme weather (38%), non-functional health facilities (23%), increased side effects (21%), unavailability of staff (18%), and fear from ongoing community outbreaks (14%). Around 28% of the participants indicated that they did not get their children vaccinated during extreme weather events or due to climate change-led events.13% of respondents reported having migrated to the current location due to extreme weather events and climate change. Participant narratives revealed insights into the challenges faced by community members and systems due to disruptions caused by variations and extreme weather events, exacerbating existing inequities and vulnerabilities. A multitude of challenges affect the delivery of essential services like vaccination due to climate-led extreme weather events. The disruptions caused by weather events range from infrastructural damage of health facilities leading to difficulties in storage of vaccines and other basic services to complete damage of roads and lack of transportation making it impossible for health workers to reach community and individuals to reach facilities. Another concern that was discussed by providers and stakeholders across the 3 countries was the difficult conditions affecting travel and the safety of the frontline workers especially during extreme weather events which lead to disruptions in service delivery. “Service delivery has been significantly impacted due to the loss of road communication and transportation issues caused by extreme floods. The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efficiency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging. Additionally, the damage to cold chain points affects vaccine storage, leading to the loss of vaccines. At the community level, we see significant effects as communities struggle to access healthcare services.” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “Our climate change is more unpredictable now, especially when we have planned programs that can&amp;#x27;t be carried out on schedule anymore because when it&amp;#x27;s raining, fewer people come out. The struggle is also that we can&amp;#x27;t go to the communities. It’s dangerous to travel when the condition of the roads is not safe. Of course, the safety of health workers is important too” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines At the community level, disruptions were majorly around accessibility challenges faced by the community during EWE which had a strong bearing on their health-seeking behavior. Participant narratives were testimonies to the significant impact of climate change-led events like heavy rainfalls and floods on the administration of vaccines, especially for individuals living in remote locations. The participants also shared how the outbreak of climate-mediated health outbreaks led to a delay in the uptake of vaccination which would have a further significant negative impact on the health of populations, especially pregnant mothers and children. “In the season of a flood, ANM/nurses can&amp;#x27;t visit us till the water completely gets dried up from the roads. It&amp;#x27;s been almost one or two months that they haven’t visited us. We don&amp;#x27;t get vaccinations on time. When the vaccine comes we still have to visit the town to get that, even in case of emergency vaccination we have to visit the town for this” - Community member FGD, Assam “The challenges arise in the administration and distribution of vaccines due to diseases that emerge from changing weather conditions. When children have a fever, parents hesitate to bring them for vaccination, and we must wait until the child recovers. This affects the intervals of vaccination administration. Water and airborne diseases linked to climate change, such as a rise in diarrhea cases, also impact parents&amp;#x27; confidence in bringing their children for immunization. They fear that vaccination might lead to fever” - Frontline Worker FGD, Philippines “No, we were not vaccinated at that time, there is a high number of child deaths in Chapari areas because they have not been vaccinated at the proper time, there is a high mortality ratio of old people, and due to lack of timely vaccination on time like the smallpox vaccine, we suffer from smallpox too here. And the children die because of this” - Community Members FGD, Assam “In the case of delivery of a Pregnant woman, the mother has to give birth on the road, in various cases the mother dies or sometimes the baby dies in the mother’s womb. We are poor people, we don&amp;#x27;t have enough savings to afford to go to the hospital” - Community Members, Assam While the vaccination services are mostly provided free of cost, there were instances of financial difficulties affecting the uptake of health services in general and vaccination among participants. Many of them reported how extreme weather events affect their livelihoods and disrupt earnings which lead them to deprioritise basic services like vaccination. “When it&amp;#x27;s raining heavily or there&amp;#x27;s a typhoon, people can&amp;#x27;t go out. Livelihoods are affected, especially during the hot and then rainy seasons. I haven&amp;#x27;t experienced it myself, just observed. Instead of having additional income from their spouse&amp;#x27;s job, it disappears as everyone is stuck at home. So they hesitate, even when there is sickness. They wait” - Community Members FGD, Philippines “Most of the people of the region live on agriculture, so when natural disasters like floods occur, in the flood season, crops are damaged and people are forced to live with a lot of risks including not seeking healthcare” - Community Members FGD, Chattisgarh Adaptations and coping strategies This theme brings the spotlight on practices adopted by community and service providers, to cope with climate change-induced events. The narratives from both community and stakeholders will provide a detailed understanding of the resilience demonstrated by the systems and communities irrespective of the challenges posed by the extreme weather events and how that ensured the continuity of essential services in addition to providing relief measures. While there have been challenges that hindered the system from achieving complete vaccination in all 3 countries, due to existing vulnerabilities and climate-induced impacts; the participants also shared some significant measures adopted by individuals as well as the system actors to address these challenges. To ensure there was continued access to vaccination irrespective of the weather-imposed challenges, service providers across all countries adopted innovative measures like strategic phasing of door-to-door visits for improved access, catch-up sessions, and regular follow-up for reminders. “Regular reminders about upcoming immunization schedules are provided, and if they can&amp;#x27;t attend during the set date, they are included in catch-up sessions facilitated by NDP or midwives. Parents who miss the initial schedule due to rain or other reasons become part of the catch-up, usually held a few days later. If parents still don&amp;#x27;t comply, we schedule another day or month and persistently remind them.”- Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Intersectoral collaboration played a crucial role in building systemic resilience by effectively responding to crises, adapting to variations in climate, and addressing complex health challenges. Having a strong functional response system that works hand in hand with health and other departments also seemed to be crucial in uninterrupted services, especially during crises. Involving and empowering local leaders to address challenges of hesitancy among communities helped build trust and improved the uptake of vaccination services among communities. Another unique strategy that was used was to identify women champions from the community itself to ensure that no one was left behind from the vaccination services. “In some cases, the patient wants to take the vaccine; however, another person is showing resistance. If there are any such issues we discuss this in VHSNC meeting and we take the help of the leaders to make them understand, post which there is almost always an increase in the turnout of members for the drives” - Frontline worker FGD, Assam “There was a significant Muslim community in one barangay that was hard to reach. What worked was having someone well-versed in explanations and a representative from the institution. At that time, we had a highly effective Nurse Deployment Project (NDP), and with the assistance of a barangay kagawad, we were able to successfully persuade the community” - Frontline Workers, Tabaco City “Now we have even made women secretaries and presidents, they did the vaccination in homes in their respective areas. They go around and see how many people have been vaccinated, need to be vaccinated, and what is the population, and how many ladies are pregnant. How many 5-year-old children are there and after keeping complete data of everyone, they will tell you when you will get vaccinated and when will you have to go. It means a lot and is much better than earlier. No pregnant lady is left unvaccinated and is not prone to any diseases or illness.” - Community influencers, Chattisgarh “During the rainy season, our community health workers will be the ones to gather information on their assigned area. We also prepared a set of medicines we give to BHERT and the 24/7 lying-in so that in case the health center is closed, the resident can still avail it. In addition, it is the BHW who will go house-to-house and facilitate the provision of health services to those who need it.” - Community member FGD, Philippines A strategy that was unique to the Philippines, was the incentivization of immunization-seeking behavior by tying them with health and other services available from the health center. Consistent and diligent efforts to make the community aware of the importance of vaccination and to dispel any myths and misconceptions also played a crucial role in ensuring the delivery of on-time services. In addition to this, awareness activities were also carried out on the impact of climate change, disease surge, and climate-mediated health outcomes as well. “Previously, during immunization campaigns, we had to visit households to inform parents about their children&amp;#x27;s immunization needs, after which they would bring their children to the Barangay Health Station (BHS). However, with the establishment of the Barangay Health Center, now, when there&amp;#x27;s a scheduled immunization session, parents voluntarily bring their children to the Barangay Health Center. This is because if they attempt to obtain any certifications from the barangay, they will be denied due to their non-compliance with bringing their child for immunization. Failure to comply means you won&amp;#x27;t receive certifications or assistance from the barangay until you adhere to the immunization schedule. This approach ensures that residents understand the importance of immunization and encourages compliance. It also allows us to hold back assistance, such as during gift-giving events until they comply with the immunization schedule or any other health-related activities where their cooperation is required” - Frontline Workers FGD, Philippines “The effect of weather change affects the trend of vaccination among communities. The people don’t come for vaccination during the extreme heat. So we hold sessions to inform them on what can be done to deal with some of the side effects. We also give them examples from previous years, like the measles outbreak. We educate them on what will happen when they don’t vaccinate their kids; like if you don’t go to the sub-centre your child will not get vitamin A, and there is a chance of disability and eye disease.It may seem like it’s scary, but they understand and then they attend the camps” - Frontline Worker FGD, Chhattisgarh It was also discussed how communities and stakeholders recognized the importance of preserving the ecosystem and environment in building resilient communities, especially in the wake of increasing disasters. Participants shared how a voluntary culture of environment conservation was practiced to prevent and mitigate the effects of any future disasters and outbreaks. “Recently, we conducted a tree planting activity with the schoolchildren to help mitigate the effects of climate change like flooding. We also educate people on the effects of use of Styrofoam to the ozone (layer). We also inform them about the importance of proper disposal so that the canals aren’t clogged up by trash” - Community Member, Bagong Silangan “The barangay has tree planting activities in Sitio Bakal. These activities are coordinated by the DENR and involve NGOs. We&amp;#x27;ve also been able to engage high school students through partnerships with schools.&amp;quot; We banned cutting of trees in our area because there are very few of them left. Our mountainous place is prone to disasters. We prohibit tree cutting” - Community Member, Baguio Measures for better preparedness This theme summarises the efforts undertaken in all 3 countries towards preparing for climate variability and disaster response mechanisms to ensure continuity of services, especially essential services like vaccination highlighting both successes and areas for improvement. While frontline workers across various locations reported well-functioning health facilities and response teams, there needs to be more coordination, training, and resource allocation as indicated by the participant narratives. There were indications from health workers as well as representatives of the beneficiary groups that having dedicated resources is crucial to ensuring continuity of services, especially during extreme weather events and disasters. The narratives also indicated that building the capacity of the frontline workers and responders was imperative to the effectiveness and success of any response and service delivery. “There should be a policy to ensure enough hiring of sufficient healthcare staff to augment the workforce. Even one health staff per barangay is good. Right now, they can be pulled out anytime because they are not permanent. In my opinion, someone should be manning the cold chain facility and health services. Someone should be assigned there anytime so we’re ready once a typhoon hits. The health workers must also work consistently. There should not be delays. If the vaccine is available, it should be given to the target and prioritized clients. There should also be an appeal to orient the barangay council so that they can also help with this” - Frontline workers FGD, Philippines “During the flood, we have a dedicated team, trained. Despite their training, there are still areas where the team lacks effectiveness, indicating room for improvement in disaster response strategies and coordination” - Medical Officer KII, Assam Participants spoke at length regarding the overall need to improve the social determinants of health including access to healthcare in general which has a significant impact on the overall health-seeking behavior of communities and more so during variations in climate patterns. The respondents also indicated that there have to be systematic processes in place to ensure that there is an adequate supply of vaccines at the facilities to meet the demands of the communities&amp;#x27; post-awareness campaigns and such. There have been multiple instances when frontline workers reported that individuals didn’t receive vaccines even after they reached facilities as communicated by the frontline workers, which further affected the trust of the communities in the system. “First, for health, we need a health sub-center. We need a hospital, we need a readily available doctor that we can consult anytime if we feel sick, and we need a medical store too, so that we can easily access the medicines we need. Next, we need a bridge over the river at Gadhua Ghat, we need access to electricity as well, an Anganwadi center, we need better farming equipment from the government because most of the villagers are farmers. We need training on how to stay healthy, how to take care of kids, how to keep them away from diseases, and how to wash hands, we need training on this. We need everything, they promised to give everything when they came asking for the vote, but after the election, they forgot their promises. We need many things but if they fulfill basic needs we can live a better life. You want us to attend camps, I can’t do anything without this” - Community member FGD, Assam, India “The vaccine supply at the health center is limited. How can we provide vaccines to constituents if the supply is limited? Even if you educate them, if there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine available at the center, they will get upset. Especially during COVID-19, they always said that they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be accepted at the hospital without a vaccine. We endorse it and then there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine. Even for students, it&amp;#x27;s the same, they need a vaccine card to enter. So when they rushed to get vaccinated, there wasn&amp;#x27;t enough vaccine in the barangay. So, let&amp;#x27;s look at the gaps, what&amp;#x27;s lacking, like the shortage of supply. Perhaps this should be brought to the attention of higher authorities that these gaps need attention in the community for better services” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Stakeholders across the countries thought that an integrated plan involving stakeholders from multiple departments would be instrumental in an effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services like vaccination. Another factor cited to be most critical to the success of complete immunization and efficient service delivery was the use of data and rigorous MIS and reporting systems that help understand the gaps and plan better. “Collaborative efforts between various stakeholders will be crucial in addressing the evolving challenges effectively. Collaborating with other departments can ensure essential equipment such as boats and life jackets are available during relief efforts. Furthermore, in partnership with the health department, we supply necessary medications and provide care to most affected communities. This collaborative effort ensures that the most vulnerable receive necessary care and support during times of crisis: - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “We need to improve the reporting system to ensure that success indicators are truthful, such as comparing the projected population with the actual population reached. This is crucial for the success of vaccination efforts” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines NEW DISCUSSION SECTION Climate change poses a significant and unprecedented threat to human health, impacting various aspects of life, including access to vaccines and exacerbating health inequities. Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and the escalation of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves are direct consequences of climate change. These events not only directly affect individuals&amp;#x27; health but also indirectly lead to population displacement and disrupt access to essential services such as healthcare and immunization. In the context of health inequities and vaccine access, climate change further complicates existing challenges. Vulnerable populations, already marginalized due to socioeconomic factors, are disproportionately affected by climate-related events. Limited access to healthcare services and infrastructure, compounded by climate-induced disasters, exacerbates health disparities, making it harder for these populations to receive necessary healthcare, in general and vaccinations, in particular. The results of this comprehensive mixed-methods investigation into vaccine inequity and its intersection with climate change among vulnerable populations across three countries offer critical insights. The study sheds light on the present state of vaccine accessibility, identifies key determinants of access, and elucidates the intricate interplay between climate change and vaccine inequity among marginalized communities. Further, it elaborates upon vaccination uptake, particularly in the context of accessibility, hesitancy and climate change. Despite a general awareness of age-appropriate vaccination schedules, significant geographical and logistical hurdles impede access hindering optimal vaccine coverage and uptake. Such impediments underscore the critical need for decentralized and easily accessible vaccination services, especially in remote areas. As highlighted in our findings, vaccine hesitancy emerges as a significant impediment to achieving comprehensive immunization coverage. Our study echoes the sentiments of existing literature, which highlights the complex and context-specific nature of vaccine hesitancy ,,. Factors such as fear of vaccines and their associated side effects, coupled with a lack of awareness regarding vaccine availability, contribute to partial or non-vaccination of children, potentially leading to vaccine-preventable illnesses and outbreaks within communities. Larson et al. (2014)1 in their global systematic review underscores the nuanced nature of determinants influencing vaccination decisions. Their review has highlighted a few studies,,, particularly those focused on India, which identify that caregiver higher education as a promoter of vaccination, others highlight low education levels as a barrier. Their study has concluded that determinants of vaccine hesitancy are complex and context-specific and in the Indian context, they concluded that illiteracy indicates more of an issue with knowledge reflecting in poor vaccine uptake. Similarly, in Krishnamurthy et al. (2023)2 in their ‘Drivers of vaccine hesitancy among vulnerable populations in India: a cross-sectional multi-state study’ has identified fear of vaccine adverse effects as the primary driver of vaccine hesitancy. The study, through its extensive covariate analysis, also iterates the relationship between health access and vaccine status as those far away were significantly less likely to be vaccinated. This finding particularly is echoed throughout the results of our study. The proximity of vaccination sites and the ease of access play crucial roles in vaccination uptake, emphasizing the need for decentralized and easily accessible vaccination services, especially in remote areas. Addressing fear using systematic information and building trust is another key factor in addressing hesitancy and improving vaccine uptake among the most vulnerable. The WHO acknowledges the critical role of Health workers, as the most trusted advisor and influencer of vaccination decisions, and to provide trusted, credible information on vaccines to the communities. Numerous studies have effectively underscored the indispensable role of community health workers, both as vaccinators and as catalysts in vaccination programs spanning various geographic regions as their pivotal contribution has been instrumental in bolstering vaccine uptake rates,,,. Our comprehensive investigation, conducted through community surveys, focused group discussions, and interviews with key stakeholders, illuminates the pivotal role of climate change in exacerbating existing disparities that extend beyond physical health to encompass livelihoods, mental well-being, and education. Gavi recognises major social impacts of climate change and detrimental effects on mental health, for example. due to crop failures, economic hardship and loss of livelihoods which are all likely to influence health-seeking behavior, including demand for immunization services as echoed in our findings as well. Extreme weather events exacerbate outbreaks of pathogens which are vaccine-preventable but such events disrupt service delivery causing delayed vaccination and leading to an increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Climate change-induced extreme weather events heighten the transmission risk of infectious diseases by disrupting public health infrastructure, displacing populations, and impeding access to routine health services like vaccination,,. Climate change further complicates disease elimination efforts by influencing the transmission dynamics of various diseases, necessitating a deeper understanding of its impact on disease burden. While acknowledging this, Mahmud et al. (2020) advocates developing mechanistic models that account for complex interactions between climate drivers and disease transmission is essential for generating reliable forecasts under different climate change scenarios. They further iterate that it is pertinent to comprehend the interacting effects of climate change alongside other global change processes, such as changes in land-use and socio-economic conditions, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of disease burden. Certain demographic subsets, including pregnant women, children and the elderly, are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change-induced extreme weather events. These populations bear the brunt of these adverse effects, underscoring the urgency for targeted interventions aimed at minimizing their impact and enhancing resilience among these groups. A Call to Action was released by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA as an advocacy brief appealing urgent actions to address the needs of pregnant women, babies and children within climate and disaster-related policies. It highlights that very few countries’ climate change response plans mention maternal or child health, describing this as “a glaring omission and emblematic of the inadequate attention to the needs of women, newborns, and children in the climate change discourse”. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and IIED, the International Institute for Environment and Development, in their book ‘Population Dynamics and Climate Change’, conclude that the poor, the elderly, pregnant women, are most vulnerable, and the implications, especially for the youngest children, can be long term. They also underscore the importance of considering the unique vulnerabilities and capacities of children at various stages of development in responses to climate change impacts. Failure to address these specific needs could render prevention and adaptation measures insufficient and potentially exacerbate existing stresses on children and other vulnerable groups. In alignment with these, several literature has highlighted the alarming impact of climate change on maternal and newborn health, revealing consistent associations between climate hazards like heat and air pollution and adverse birth outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted policies and actions to protect the most vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, children, adolescents and the elderly,,,. Furthermore, the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events associated with climate change exacerbate these challenges, amplifying the strain on health systems already grappling with limited resources and capacity. As climate change continues to escalate, health systems must urgently implement adaptive strategies to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events on immunization services. This includes bolstering infrastructure resilience, diversifying transportation routes, ensuring adequate backup power sources, and implementing robust contingency plans to maintain immunization coverage even in the face of climate-related disruptions. One of the key initiatives by Gavi&amp;#x27;s Health Systems and Immunisation Strengthening (HSIS) programmes is to turn &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; vaccine storage, reduce the carbon footprint of immunisation programmes and enable health facilities to be more resilient when disasters strike. Other critical strategies to bring vaccination services directly to communities&amp;#x27; doorsteps, fostering community participation, and conducting targeted educational campaigns have proven effective in motivating communities and enhancing their access to vaccination services, even amidst weather-related challenges. Prosocial norms like altruism, solidarity, and volunteerism are clear, healthy, ethical standards and beliefs that promote prosocial behavior and minimize health risks. This was particularly pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and numerous studies have highlighted the critical role of community involvement in promoting vaccine uptake. It is evident from literature that communities can play important and active roles in prevention and control, and community engagement actors could be in the form of local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility committees, individuals which can be utilised for different functions such as designing and planning, community entry and trust building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration,. In a study by Hopkins et al. (2023), UNICEF supported community based approaches to increase COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Demand in four countries have been discussed. In Zambia, community rapid assessment provided invaluable real-time insights around COVID-19 vaccination; in Iraq, direct community engagement was utilised to deliver health messages and encourage service uptake, resulting in over 4.4 million doses of COVID-19; in Ghana, a human-centered design initiative was applied to co-develop community-informed strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccination rates; in India, a risk communication and community engagement initiative reached half a million people over six months, translating into a 25% increase in vaccination rates. Moreover, the results from our study underscored the significance of intersectoral collaboration, streamlined planning, and resource distribution in ensuring robust crisis management and continuous provision of vital services, thereby bolstering the resilience of vulnerable communities. Efforts to advance sustainable development through cross-sectoral collaboration have gained recognition post IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) on the impacts and projected future risks of climate change for health, well-being, migration and conflict. The reports necessitates urgent, multi-scale, collaborative efforts to build climate-resilient health systems, given the widespread inadequacy of resources and mental health support; targeted investments in health systems and integrated approaches are crucial to enhance resilience against climate-sensitive health risks. Adaptive capacity is seen to be different from adaptation, as adaptive capacity is the ability to continuously adapt to the changing situational context that enables an organization to facilitate transition or transformation into a new state of being as a means of mitigating risk,. Strengths &amp;amp; Limitations of the study Strengths of the study lies in the comprehensive examination of vaccine inequity and its interaction with climate change among vulnerable populations across three countries, offering critical insights into the present state of vaccine accessibility and the complex determinants affecting uptake. By employing a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative survey data with qualitative analysis, the study provides a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted challenges surrounding vaccination uptake, particularly in the context of accessibility and hesitancy. The study&amp;#x27;s multinational perspective enhances the generalizability of its findings, while its identification of key determinants of vaccine access and hesitancy offers valuable insights for public health policy and practice. However, the findings may not be applicable to populations with different healthcare systems, socio-economic backgrounds, or cultural contexts. Therefore, caution should be exercised when applying the results to other settings. Although the study touches upon the intersection of climate change and vaccine inequity, the extent of this intersection may not have been fully explored due to limitations in data availability or methodological constraints. Future research should aim to overcome these limitations to further enhance our understanding of vaccine inequity and its determinants. Conclusions The findings underscore the importance of addressing geographical, cultural, and systemic challenges to ensure equitable access to vaccination services, especially during extreme weather events. Systematically addressing challenges in accessing services like vaccination and building climate-resilient healthcare systems are essential for improving universal health coverage and protecting the most vulnerable communities.

May it be governmental policies, financial markets, international trade, manufacturing, or even the entertainment industry - climate change is a topic that seldom goes unspoken about. According to the Global Risks Report 2024 by the World Economic Forum (ref : link), five of the top 10 global risks that the world may face in the coming decade are environmental risks. It is noteworthy that the top 4 are all environmental risks. They are, in the order of decreasing severity, as follows: a) extreme weather events, b)critical changes to Earth systems, c)biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and d) natural resource shortages. This should ring an alarm for strategic planning and concrete actions across all the nations. Source : WEF Global Risks Perception Survey, 2023-2024 Understanding and perception of climate change varies from country to country and communities to communities. Hence, there is no one standard definition for climate change. But to define it broadly, climate change encompasses significant and lasting changes in the earth’s climate patterns in global and regional contexts over long periods of time. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are all manifestations of climate change that one may experience in their regions. The impact of climate change is multifaceted and poses significant challenges, adversely affecting various sectors such as agriculture, trade and businesses, health services, manufacturing, etc. Countries witnessing significant climate change face heightened risks of heatwaves, floods, and droughts, leading to agricultural disruptions, food insecurity, and economic losses. Particularly susceptible to these impacts are the vulnerable populations, including indigenous communities and those in remote areas. From the perspective of health, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, affecting public health. The variability in climate conditions further exacerbates challenges in healthcare delivery, including routine immunization, as extreme weather events disrupt infrastructure and create logistical hurdles. This report summarizes the findings from a multi-country study conducted in three LMICs in south-east Asia - India, Philippines and Cambodia. This study was conducted across to understand the intricate interplay between climate change impacts and vaccine equity in these regions. The information gathered from the three countries underscores the vulnerabilities of health systems, particularly in the face of environmental crises, emphasizing the need for resilience and adaptability. By shedding light on challenges related to healthcare accessibility, infrastructure inadequacies, and cultural dynamics influencing vaccine acceptance, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted barriers faced by these nations. Additionally, the identification of operational challenges during environmental crises and the proposed policy implications and adaptation strategies offer valuable insights for strengthening health systems and ensuring equitable vaccine distribution. As climate change increasingly affects global health, this study contributes vital data from diverse South-East Asian contexts, making it a significant and timely endeavor with implications for international efforts to address the intersection of climate change and healthcare equity. Recognizing the broader implications of climate change on these nations’ health systems is crucial for developing adaptive strategies, resilient healthcare systems, and sustainable development practices to mitigate the far-reaching consequences on the public health, environment, and economy [1]. About the countries India Climatic Conditions in each country Socio-economic conditions Policies, Vaccine capability, vaccination services Rationale for selecting the regions Phillippines Climatic Conditions in each country Socio-economic conditions Policies, Vaccine capability, vaccination services Rationale for selecting the regions Cambodia Climatic Conditions in each country Socio-economic conditions Policies, Vaccine capability, vaccination services Rationale for selecting the regions The report emphasizes community engagement as a cornerstone in addressing both vaccine inequity and disaster response. Empowering local leaders and health workers fosters trust, combats vaccine hesitancy, and promotes vaccination uptake. Additionally, capacity building for healthcare workers, particularly in areas vulnerable to climate change, is essential for effective healthcare delivery. Public-private partnerships are crucial for pooling resources, expertise, and networks to strengthen vaccine distribution and outreach efforts. This also explores recovery and relief efforts, including actions taken to restore health systems, infrastructure, and community well-being after disasters. While government support through financial assistance and free medicines is acknowledged, concerns exist regarding the adequacy, timeliness, and consistency of this aid. The example of the Chief Minister&amp;#x27;s Shram Yojana in Chhattisgarh highlights this challenge, where implementation issues resulted in delays and inadequate payments. “In Baguio City, Philippines, we have inadequate supply of vaccines because of lack of funds to purchase all needed vaccines to complete the target” - Health Official, Baguio City. The report underscores the critical role of addressing vaccine inequity and improving healthcare infrastructure for comprehensive health services, especially in the face of climate change. Community members in Barangay Bagong Silangan stressed the need for increased medication availability, additional medical staff, and improved vaccine access. This highlights the pressing demand for sustainable staffing, infrastructure development, and collaborative approaches. “In Raipur, India, suggestions include increasing the availability of staff and keeping all vaccination centers open, with one center every 5 kilometers&amp;quot; - Medical Officer, Chhattisgarh “In Kharupetia, India, rotating Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) in hard-to-reach areas and establishing additional cold chain points with solar power systems are recommended strategies to ensure continuous healthcare provision and vaccine efficacy” - Medical Officer, Chhattisgarh Based on these identified needs, the report proposes actionable measures. These include utilizing ICT for spreading awareness, ensuring continuous operation of vaccination centers, and establishing solar-powered cold chain points to maintain vaccine efficacy, particularly in remote areas. Additionally, community engagement through local leaders and public announcement systems is recommended to improve disaster preparedness and healthcare provision. The report emphasizes collaboration between stakeholders - government, healthcare workers, and external organizations - as key to implementing sustainable solutions and effectively addressing vaccine inequities.

    <Content>--- Page 1 --- Multi-country study to explore the relationship between vaccine equity, climate and health By: Catalyst Management Services (With Support from Country Partners) --- Page 2 --- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report details the ﬁndings from the cross-sectional mixed methods study that into the complex relationship between climate change and vaccine inequity among vulnerable populations in Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. This study conducted among a diverse set of participants, both supply and demand side, brings to light the different aspects of disparities and the disruptions caused by the climate-related events that further exacerbated the inequities. While the majority of the participants are aware of the vaccination schedules, fear of side effects, lack of awareness, and distance from the vaccination sites hinder complete vaccination. Age, occupation, awareness of vaccination schedules, perceived access to vaccination, and proximity to vaccination sites signiﬁcantly inﬂuence vaccine uptake. Challenges in accessing vaccination services, particularly during extreme weather events, signiﬁcantly contribute to partial or non-vaccination. Substantial proportion of the respondents reported experiencing change in weather patterns, with extreme heat being the most prevalent. Climate change disproportionately affected the different subsets of population like elderly, pregnant women, and children and negatively impacted health, livelihoods, and access to vaccination across all geographies. Despite challenges, communities and health systems demonstrate resilience through innovative measures like door-to-door visits, community engagement and participation as well as intersectoral collaboration to ensure continuity of services especially during extreme weather events. Building capacities of frontline workers and communities, efﬁcient resource allocation, and data-driven planning were identiﬁed to be crucial for effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services. The study highlights the critical need to address geographical, cultural, and systemic barriers to ensure equitable access to vaccination services, especially in the face of climate change-induced challenges. Understanding the nuanced interplay between climate change and vaccine inequity is essential to designing and implementing targeted interventions to protect the most vulnerable populations and build resilient healthcare systems for the future. --- Page 3 --- BACKGROUND &amp;amp; RATIONALE The impact of climate change is multifaceted and poses signiﬁcant challenges across various sectors. Rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events have adverse effects on livelihoods, access to clean water, and public health. These countries witness heightened risks of heatwaves, ﬂoods, and droughts, leading to agricultural disruptions, food insecurity, and economic losses. Vulnerable populations, including indigenous communities and those in remote areas, are particularly susceptible to these impacts. Additionally, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, affecting public health. The variability in climate conditions further exacerbates challenges in healthcare delivery, including routine immunization, as extreme weather events disrupt infrastructure and create logistical hurdles. Recognizing the broader implications of climate change on these nations is crucial for developing adaptive strategies, resilient healthcare systems, and sustainable development practices to mitigate the far-reaching consequences on the environment, economy, and public health. [1] In the Philippines, Cambodia, and India, primary health care (PHC) stands as a vital pillar for promoting holistic well-being, with a common reliance on community health workers to bridge gaps in healthcare access and build trust among diverse populations. While the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act in the Philippines underscores the importance of equitable access, these nations grapple with persistent barriers such as limited resources, ﬁnancial constraints, and disparities in healthcare, further exacerbated by the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. [ 2 ] Each country addresses these issues through initiatives like free routine vaccinations and maternal health programs, recognizing the importance of preventive care. Cambodia faces population growth challenges, particularly in impoverished northeastern regions, with indigenous communities encountering hurdles related to education and early marriage [ 3 ]. Meanwhile, India contends with a dual obstacle of low awareness and operational difﬁculties in routine immunization, compounded by cultural beliefs and logistical constraints. Collectively, these nations emphasize the need for improved infrastructure, increased healthcare workforce engagement, and resilient health systems to navigate existing challenges and enhance the effectiveness of routine health programs.[ 4 ] Climate change poses signiﬁcant challenges to the healthcare systems of the Philippines, Cambodia, and India, with distinct impacts on each country. In the Philippines, a country susceptible to typhoons and extreme weather events, the changing climate can lead to disruptions in healthcare infrastructure, affecting the delivery of essential health services. The vulnerability of the Philippines to natural disasters, exacerbated by the effects of --- Page 4 --- climate change, may result in challenges in providing timely and consistent healthcare, especially in the wake of frequent typhoons and ﬂoods.[ 5 ] Similarly, Cambodia, facing potential changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures, may experience disruptions in agricultural practices, affecting the livelihoods of communities. The Plateau and Mountains region, with its indigenous populations, may be particularly vulnerable, facing socio-economic challenges aggravated by the impacts of climate change on agricultural activities.[ 6 ] In India, a country with diverse climate patterns, extreme weather events such as heatwaves and ﬂoods can hinder routine immunization programs, especially in remote and underserved areas. The increased health risks, coupled with existing operational challenges in the healthcare sector, create a complex scenario where climate change compounds the difﬁculties in delivering essential health services. Addressing these challenges requires not only strengthening healthcare infrastructure and accessibility but also implementing adaptive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on the health and well-being of these nations.[ 7 ] The study is of paramount importance as it delves into the intricate interplay between climate change impacts and vaccine equity in these regions. The information gathered from the three countries underscores the vulnerabilities of health systems, particularly in the face of environmental crises, emphasizing the need for resilience and adaptability. By shedding light on challenges related to healthcare accessibility, infrastructure inadequacies, and cultural dynamics inﬂuencing vaccine acceptance, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted barriers faced by these nations. Additionally, the identiﬁcation of operational challenges during environmental crises and the proposed policy implications and adaptation strategies offer valuable insights for strengthening health systems and ensuring equitable vaccine distribution. As climate change increasingly affects global health, this study contributes vital data from diverse Southeast Asian contexts, making it a signiﬁcant and timely endeavor with implications for international efforts to address the intersection of climate change and healthcare equity. AIM OF THE STUDY To understand how weather events such as ﬂoods, droughts, heat waves, cold waves, etc., and climate change affect the supply and access of vaccines for vulnerable communities in speciﬁc regions in each of the three Southeast Asian countries: Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. --- Page 5 --- METHODS Study Design A cross-sectional mixed methods approach was employed to investigate the intricate relationship between climate change and vaccine inequity among vulnerable populations in Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. This methodological framework facilitated a thorough exploration of the factors contributing to vaccination disparities and the inﬂuence of climate-related events on exacerbating these disparities. Participants and setting The study encompassed a comprehensive approach to understanding the dynamics of vaccination inequities and climate change impacts across 3 Southeast Asian regions: Cambodia, India, and the Philippines. The geographical diversity of these regions provided a rich tapestry of cultural, social, and environmental contexts that inﬂuenced healthcare access and vulnerability to climate-related health risks. In each country, participants were recruited from various strata, including riverbank villages, migrated populations, tribal communities, and geographically isolated areas, ensuring the representation of diverse cultural and social identities. The sampling approach employed a stratiﬁed random sampling method, with estimated sample sizes of 384 for India, 385 for Cambodia, and 384 for the Philippines, calculated to provide statistically representative samples for conducting cross-sectional prevalence studies with a conﬁdence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5%. The study participants consisted of primary beneﬁciaries of vaccination programs and caretakers of primary beneﬁciaries, representing individuals directly impacted by vaccination policies and healthcare services. Additionally, key informant interviews and focus group discussions involved stakeholders such as healthcare professionals, frontline workers, policymakers, and community representatives. These stakeholders provided critical insights into existing inequities, climate change impacts, and community coping mechanisms. Recruitment of participants was facilitated through civil society organizations with extensive experience in working with vulnerable populations, ensuring access to marginalized communities and diverse stakeholders. For the quantitative surveys, participants were selected based on their status as beneﬁciaries of vaccination programs and their willingness to participate in the study. Those above the age of 18 were enrolled from the community side, ensuring a broad representation of adults impacted by vaccination policies. For qualitative data collection, a --- Page 6 --- concept saturation-driven methodology was employed to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the research focus. Participants for key informant interviews and focus group discussions were identiﬁed using a snowballing technique, inviting individuals with critical insights and expertise until information saturation was reached. Data Collection and Tools Based on literature examining vaccine inequity and climate change, a structured questionnaire was developed in English for the community-based surveys. The tool was piloted in all 3 countries with the support of local partners and was modiﬁed based on the observations from the ground. Before administering the tool to the participants, it was translated into the local languages such as Hindi (India), with aids for enumerators and researchers in Assamese (India), Khmer (Cambodia), and Filipino (Phillippines) - spoken in the study sites. The tool captured information on the following areas: ● socio-demographic characteristics ● knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to vaccination ● access to vaccination services. ● In addition to that, the survey also measured the recent changes in weather conditions and the perceived impact of climate change on vaccine access and inequity. The key outcome variables that were assessed were vaccination status and perceived accessibility to vaccine services. The stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured guide to deeply understand their experiences with accessing vaccination, existing inequities and pathways that contribute to and exacerbate such inequities among different subsets of populations, etc. The qualitative discussions also probed to understand the community and provider perspective on the nuanced interplay between climate change and vaccine inequity. Ethical Considerations The study obtained ethical approval from the Catalyst Foundation Institutional Review Board. The team explained the purpose of the survey to the respondents, and informed consent was obtained from all participants before their involvement in the study. The --- Page 7 --- participants were informed that they could choose to discontinue the interview at any point in time. Data Analysis The data from community-based surveys were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS 26.0 version. The categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages, and all continuous variables were represented as mean and standard deviations. Bivariate analysis was carried out to understand the signiﬁcant association between dependent and independent variables. Those variables signiﬁcantly associated with the dependent variables at p-value &amp;lt; 0.05 were entered into different regression models. Multivariable logistic? regression models were used to identify potential predictors of vaccination status and self-perceived accessibility to vaccination services. For the qualitative data, the transcripts were uploaded to Dedoose software, and thematic analysis was carried out by using a systematic process of reading the excerpts, coding, grouping codes, and identifying themes and sub-themes from the participant narratives. RESULTS Findings from the community-based surveys A total of 1183 individuals (India - 384, Cambodia - 385, and Philippines - 384) participated from the 3 countries in the community-based surveys of which 84% were females and 16% were males. The average age of the participant was 36 and ranged from 18 to 85 years old with about 2/3rd of them being from the age group of 18 to 35 years. The majority of the participants were married (80%) or practicing cohabiting or living together (12%). Education levels varied, with a signiﬁcant portion having completed high school (34.1%) and others having primary school (23.5%) or middle school (14.4%) education. Notably, about 15% reported having no formal education. Occupation proﬁles indicated a substantial proportion engaged in farming (41%) and self-employment (35%), with fewer participants in salaried work (13%) or organized/unorganized labor (11%). More than half of the respondents were from nuclear families with a considerable proportion reporting that either spouses or partners were the chief wage earners (46%) followed by 33% reporting that both partners were income earners. While more than half of the --- Page 8 --- respondents reported they had 4-8 members in their household, around 67% reported that they had 2 or more children in their household. Geographically, the majority of participants resided in rural areas (62.3%), followed by urban (20%), riverbank (6.3%), Char (12%), hilly (12%), and forest areas (9.1%). More than a quarter of the respondents (30%) reported that they didn&amp;#x27;t have access to safe drinking water and 19% did not have access to sanitation facilities. Vaccination Access and Awareness The majority of the respondents (84%) were aware of the vaccination schedules in their countries. Among these respondents, community health workers emerged as the predominant source of information at 74% followed by health centers and yellow cards (speciﬁc to Cambodia) at 39% and 20% respectively. However, only 5% of the participants reported channels like awareness campaigns as the primary source of information. Regarding vaccination status among children under 2 years old, 82% reported that their children were fully vaccinated, whereas 16% were partially vaccinated, leaving only 2% unvaccinated. Among those who reported having kids partially vaccinated or not vaccinated at all, the primary reasons reported were lack of awareness/information, fear of vaccines/side effects, lack of interest in vaccination, etc. 38% of the partial/unvaccinated status was due to children being scheduled for next dose of vaccination. --- Page 9 --- 84% of the respondents mentioned that their peers tend to miss vaccination with primary reasons being fear (65%), lack of awareness and information (23%), lack of vaccine availability (11%), disinterest (8%), and accessibility challenges (6%. Regarding the accessibility of overall vaccination services for children, 66% of respondents reported that it was (very) easy to access vaccination services, while around 10% found accessing these services to be (very) difﬁcult. The survey data on vaccination sites revealed that 33% of the respondents attended sessions held at health centers, followed by 28% at schools, and 20% at Anganwadi centers. Additionally, the house of the village chief (exclusive for Cambodia) was another site where 12% of the respondents took vaccination. More than half of the participants mentioned that the nearest vaccination site was within a distance of less than 1 km, followed by 31% reporting that they had a vaccination site within 5 km from their residence. Respondents primarily relied on walking (57%) or using personal vehicles to reach the sites. More than 2/3rd of the study population reported that they faced one or the other challenges while accessing vaccination services. The top reasons cited were distance (44%), challenges due to extreme weather events (28%), unavailability of transport (27%), and physical constraints like ill-health (13%). About 42% of respondents mentioned that there was some recent outbreak of vaccine-preventable illness in the community. Some of --- Page 10 --- the common outbreaks reported were Flu (64%) followed by chickenpox (43%), measles (17%), mumps (14%), and diarrhea (9%). In the context of HPV vaccination status in the Philippines and Cambodia, the survey revealed that 72% of respondents reported that their children have been fully vaccinated against HPV, while 22% stated they were not vaccinated, and 6% mentioned being partially vaccinated. Delving into the reasons behind the vaccination status, 59% of respondents cited fear as a factor, indicating apprehensions related to HPV vaccination. Additionally, 49% mentioned a lack of awareness and information as a barrier, suggesting a need for improved education and communication about the beneﬁts and importance of HPV vaccination. A smaller proportion (9%) attributed their vaccination status to a lack of availability of the vaccine, highlighting potential challenges in accessing vaccination services. Awareness on Climate Change The study also explored the populations’ awareness of climate change and its impact on health, livelihoods, and access to vaccination. A substantial proportion of respondents from Cambodia (92%), the Philippines (95%), and India (83%) conﬁrmed experiencing changes in weather patterns in recent years. Across the surveyed countries, distinct weather events have shaped the experiences of participants. A higher proportion of the respondents from all the 3 countries indicated experiencing extreme heat. The second highest occurrence of distinct weather events was increased rainfall in the Philippines (74%), followed by ﬂoods in India at 34%, and cold waves and droughts (33%) in Cambodia. The majority of the respondents said that climate change negatively impacted their health, with common health problems during extreme weather events being fever (93%), --- Page 11 --- respiratory illness (41%), weakness (38%), diarrheal illness (36%), dehydration (26%), skin diseases (23%), and heat stroke (16%). In addition to that, the changes in weather events signiﬁcantly affected their lives. The top 5 areas that were impacted were livelihoods and income - 75%, access to clean water - 37%, child education - 35%, food crises - 33%, access to health services - 20%, and increased illness - 17%. Regarding vulnerability to climate change, 62% of respondents felt moderately/extremely vulnerable to climate change, while 13% felt slightly vulnerable or not vulnerable. Children (89%) were perceived as the most vulnerable, followed by the elderly (76%), pregnant and lactating women (46%), women (44%), and people with disabilities (20%). When exploring the interconnectedness between extreme weather events and access to vaccination, 43% indicated that extreme weather events have an impact on access to vaccination. The primary pathways of impact as reported by the participants were the poor condition of roads (45%), lack of transport facilities (44%), illness due to extreme weather (38%), non-functional health facilities (23%), increased side effects (21%), unavailability of staff (18%), and fear from ongoing community outbreaks (14%). --- Page 12 --- Around 28% of the participants indicated that they did not get their children vaccinated during extreme weather events or due to climate change-led events. 13% of respondents reported having migrated to the current location due to extreme weather events and climate change. Determinants of vaccine uptake and access ➔ From further analysis, it was seen that as age advances, the respondents tend to have fully vaccinated their kids compared to those who are younger. It was also identiﬁed that respondents who are self-employed/in business and are doing salaried work are signiﬁcantly more likely to fully vaccinate their children compared to farmers/dependent on agriculture and daily labor. None of the other socio-demographic factors seem to be signiﬁcantly associated with vaccination status. ➔ Being aware of the vaccination schedule seems to be signiﬁcantly associated with full vaccination status compared to those who are not aware. Another factor that inﬂuences the vaccination status is the perceived access to vaccination. Individuals who perceive difﬁculty in accessing vaccination are signiﬁcantly associated with a higher proportion of children being partially vaccinated or unvaccinated. ➔ In line with existing evidence, facing challenges while accessing vaccination is signiﬁcantly associated with a higher proportion of respondents reporting partial vaccination status compared to a higher proportion of full vaccination status among those reporting no challenges. ➔ Similarly, distance from the vaccination site was another factor that signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced vaccination status. A signiﬁcantly high proportion of the respondents who live closer to the vaccination sites (less than or equal to 5 km) reported --- Page 13 --- complete vaccination status compared to those who live far from the vaccination sites. Findings from interviews and discussions with stakeholders and communities The qualitative study explored in-depth, the different facets of inequities faced by communities concerning vaccination as well as the role of climate change in exacerbating these inequities. A total of 71 in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with individuals who are caretakers of children eligible for vaccination, as well as key stakeholders from various departments like health, disaster response, Community leaders, PRIs, VHSNC members, etc. The analysis of the qualitative data from the 3 countries is summarized in 4 themes as listed below: ➔ Risks and Vulnerabilities ➔ Climate-induced disruptions to service delivery and access ➔ Health system resilience and adaptations ➔ Preparedness and planning Risks and Vulnerabilities This theme details the existing challenges experienced by communities which makes them more vulnerable to the inequities and puts them at an increased risk for negative impacts induced by and related to climate. Participants from the community discussed how the challenges that exist in terms of access to healthcare, socio-economic status, cultural beliefs, built environment, and geographical location impact their health, livelihoods, and overall well-being drastically. This theme is further broken down to explain the inequities and vulnerabilities at different levels - individual, system, and community/geography. A common challenge echoed by participants across all countries was the difﬁculty in accessing vaccination services due to their location. Many of them shared that residing in remote areas critically affects their ability to get vaccinated and access other health services despite the efforts from healthcare providers trying to reach them. The challenges are particularly exacerbated with extreme weather events like ﬂoods during rainy seasons when the transport facilities also get affected especially for newborn children and pregnant women. The geographical constraints combined with ﬁnancial difﬁculties also make it difﬁcult for communities to resort to alternate measures like arranging paid transport, etc. “During rainy seasons we can’t get there due to many reasons especially, transport-related, and vaccinations get canceled and then we have to go next time. Sometimes we do, sometimes, we don’t” - Brick Kiln a&amp;amp; Migrant Community member FGD, Chattisgarh. --- Page 14 --- “The challenge we encountered is that there are parts of Bagong Silangan that are quite remote. Although we have an outreach program and we visit them at least once a month for various services, the distance and size of the barangay pose challenges. The accessibility of patients to come is also a challenge” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines “If a woman is pregnant in the winter she gets the vaccination on time; in the rainy season, she does not get this vaccination as nurses don&amp;#x27;t visit here due to ﬂoods. We have to reserve a boat and take them to Mangaldoi. We have to offer someone tea too, we have to give the person Rs. 2000-3000 as rent. Those who can afford the rent get the vaccination on time, by travelling to Mandaldoi. Else, we don’t get the vaccines on time” - Community member FGD, Assam Another common issue that emerged across all 3 countries was the cultural beliefs and individual perceptions that made them hesitant towards and prevented them from accessing vaccination which makes them susceptible to illnesses and has led to outbreaks in the community. The knowledge gap is another key challenge that critically affects and compounds existing inequities as lack of information leads to misconceptions and prevents them from accessing vaccination. The narratives from the stakeholder interviews also indicate that there is a fear among communities to let their children be vaccinated during extreme weather events due to possible illness and injury. “People in the community listen to each other and they are afraid of the side effects of the vaccines. In addition, rumors from one person to another people also a big issue. Furthermore, there were 3 dozes provided to their children at the same time, so they were afraid of it. The side effects made their children not feel well such as fever after the injection. So they think that the health care provider makes their children sick” - Community Chief KII, Cambodia “Adverse weather events do not affect the vaccination and immunization services because they are existing interventions. However, it’s the health-seeking behavior of the people that is affected by weather events. Some parents do not allow their children to go out and be vaccinated during rainy days because they might get sick, like cough and colds, due to the bad weather” - City Health Ofﬁcer KII, Philippines “When I asked them whether the child has been vaccinated, they said that no one has got it in our society, so how can we get vaccinated? They say that when the children get vaccinated they get a fever, their health deteriorates and the children cry and they cannot take care of the children in such situations” - Community member FGD, Chattisgarh Challenges with structural determinants like systemic incapabilities in terms of supply, logistics, HR, and capacities also hindered access to vaccination and perpetuated inequity among the communities that are already vulnerable. These kinds of challenges affect the --- Page 15 --- efﬁciency of services and affect the trust of the communities in the system making them hesitant to receive services. Another concern was the lack of support from the authorities in addressing the existing concerns and providing adequate relief in the event of a crisis in the community. “Most seniors cannot avail of the vaccines and their vaccination is delayed especially for anti-ﬂu because of the limited vaccine supply” - Community member FGD, Philippines “The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efﬁciency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “No, there is zero support in our area. Even the administration came and blamed us. No facilities are provided like boats, or life jackets during ﬂoods. Rather they scold us for not reaching on time”- Frontline Worker FGD, Assam The interviews with key stakeholders also revealed another dimension of challenges concerning complete vaccination among communities. Participants shared their experience of communities being lackadaisical when it comes to vaccine-seeking behavior which sometimes becomes a roadblock. Another key concern that was echoed across the countries was the displacement and migration practices among communities. This posed a two-way challenge making it difﬁcult for healthcare workers to vaccinate these families as well as the children and other eligible members getting missed out from the vaccination programs due to moving from one place to another. “Awareness among the people like going to Anganwadi to get their children vaccinated is not that strong. The people of Bhansoj have become lazy, they think that this is a home delivery service, Mitanin will come to their home and they get vaccinated, hence people do not reach on their own to the vaccination centers” - Block medical ofﬁcer KII, Chattisgarh “We are somewhat struggling with residents who frequently move. Many of them are just transient. In terms of scheduling vaccine appointments at the health center, it seems like it&amp;#x27;s not being followed. We are the ones who assist in locating residents who need to be vaccinated. When children are listed for vaccination and suddenly disappear, that&amp;#x27;s one problem” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Climate-induced disruptions to service delivery and access This theme discusses the challenges faced by community members and systems due to the disruptions caused by variations and extreme weather events and how that magniﬁes --- Page 16 --- existing inequities and makes the communities more vulnerable. The participant narratives are described at 2 levels - systemic and community. A multitude of challenges affect the delivery of essential services like vaccination due to climate-led extreme weather events. The disruptions caused by weather events range from infrastructural damage of health facilities leading to difﬁculties in storage of vaccines and other basic services to complete damage of roads and lack of transportation making it impossible for health workers to reach community and individuals to reach facilities. Another concern that was discussed by providers and stakeholders across the 3 countries was the difﬁcult conditions affecting travel and the safety of the frontline workers especially during extreme weather events which lead to disruptions in service delivery. “Service delivery has been signiﬁcantly impacted due to the loss of road communication and transportation issues caused by extreme ﬂoods. The infrastructure at village-level health centers, where vaccinations are administered, is often damaged. Without proper facilities, maintaining the efﬁciency of vaccination campaigns becomes challenging. Additionally, the damage to cold chain points affects vaccine storage, leading to the loss of vaccines. At the community level, we see signiﬁcant effects as communities struggle to access healthcare services.” - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “Our climate change is more unpredictable now, especially when we have planned programs that can&amp;#x27;t be carried out on schedule anymore because when it&amp;#x27;s raining, fewer people come out. The struggle is also that we can&amp;#x27;t go to the communities. It’s dangerous to travel when the condition of the roads is not safe. Of course, the safety of health workers is important too” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines At the community level, disruptions were majorly around accessibility challenges faced by the community during EWE which had a strong bearing on their health-seeking behavior. Participant narratives were testimonies to the signiﬁcant impact of climate change-led events like heavy rainfalls and ﬂoods on the administration of vaccines, especially for individuals living in remote locations. The participants also shared how the outbreak of climate-mediated health outbreaks led to a delay in the uptake of vaccination which would have a further signiﬁcant negative impact on the health of populations, especially pregnant mothers and children. “In the season of a ﬂood, ANM/nurses can&amp;#x27;t visit us till the water completely gets dried up from the roads, it&amp;#x27;s almost one or two months that they haven’t visited us. We don&amp;#x27;t get vaccinations on time. When the vaccine comes we still have to visit the town to get that, even in case of emergency vaccination we have to visit the town for this” - Community member FGD, Assam --- Page 17 --- “The challenges arise in the administration and distribution of vaccines due to diseases that emerge from changing weather conditions. When children have a fever, parents hesitate to bring them for vaccination, and we must wait until the child recovers. This affects the intervals of vaccination administration. Water and airborne diseases linked to climate change, such as a rise in diarrhea cases, also impact parents&amp;#x27; conﬁdence in bringing their children for immunization. They fear that vaccination might lead to fever” - Frontline Worker FGD, Philippines “No, we were not vaccinated at that time, there is a high number of child deaths in Chapari areas because they have not been vaccinated at the proper time, there is a high mortality ratio of old people, and due to lack of timely vaccination on time like the smallpox vaccine, we suffer from smallpox too here. And the children die because of this” - Community Members FGD, Assam “In the case of delivery of a Pregnant woman, the mother has to give birth on the road, in various cases the mother dies or sometimes the baby dies in the mother’s womb. We are poor people, we don&amp;#x27;t have enough savings to afford to go to the hospital” - Community Members, Assam While the vaccination services are mostly provided free of cost, there were instances of ﬁnancial difﬁculties affecting the uptake of health services in general and vaccination among participants. Many of them reported how extreme weather events affect their livelihoods and disrupt earnings which lead them to de-prioritise basic services like vaccination. “When it&amp;#x27;s raining heavily or there&amp;#x27;s a typhoon, people can&amp;#x27;t go out. Livelihoods are affected, especially during the hot and then rainy seasons. I haven&amp;#x27;t experienced it myself, just observed. Instead of having additional income from their spouse&amp;#x27;s job, it disappears as everyone is stuck at home. So they hesitate, even when there is sickness. They wait” - Community Members FGD, Philippines “Most of the people of the region live on agriculture, so when natural disasters like ﬂoods occur, in the ﬂood season, crops are damaged and people are forced to live with a lot of risks including not seeking healthcare” - Community Members FGD, Chattisgarh Health Systems Resilience and Adaptations This theme brings the spotlight on practices adopted by community and service providers, to cope with climate change-induced events. The narratives from both community and stakeholders will provide a detailed understanding of the resilience demonstrated by the systems and communities irrespective of the challenges posed by the extreme weather events and how that ensured the continuity of essential services in addition to providing relief measures. --- Page 18 --- While there have been challenges that hindered the system from achieving complete vaccination in all 3 countries, due to existing vulnerabilities and climate-induced impacts; the participants also shared some signiﬁcant measures adopted by individuals as well as the system actors to address these challenges. To ensure there was continued access to vaccination irrespective of the weather-imposed challenges, service providers across all countries adopted innovative measures like strategic phasing of door-to-door visits for improved access, catch-up sessions, and regular follow-up for reminders. “Regular reminders about upcoming immunization schedules are provided, and if they can&amp;#x27;t attend during the set date, they are included in catch-up sessions facilitated by NDP or midwives. Parents who miss the initial schedule due to rain or other reasons become part of the catch-up, usually held a few days later. If parents still don&amp;#x27;t comply, we schedule another day or month and persistently remind them.”- Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Intersectoral collaboration played a crucial role in building systemic resilience by effectively responding to crises, adapting to variations in climate, and addressing complex health challenges. Having a strong functional response system that works hand in hand with health and other departments also seemed to be crucial in uninterrupted services, especially during crises. Involving and empowering local leaders to address challenges of hesitancy among communities helped build trust and improved the uptake of vaccination services among communities. Another unique strategy that was used, was to identify women champions from the community itself to ensure that no one was left behind from the vaccination services. “ In some cases, the patient wants to take the vaccine however, another person is showing resistance. If there are any such issues we discuss this in VHSNC meeting and we take the help of the leaders to make them understand, post which there is almost always an increase in the turn out of members for the drives” - Frontline worker FGD, Assam “There was a signiﬁcant Muslim community in one barangay that was hard to reach. What worked was having someone well-versed in explanations and a representative from the institution. At that time, we had a highly effective Nurse Deployment Project (NDP), and with the assistance of a barangay kagawad, we were able to successfully persuade the community” - Frontline Workers, Tabaco City “Now we have even made women secretaries and presidents, they did the vaccination in homes in their respective areas. They go around and see how many people have been vaccinated, need to be vaccinated, and what is the population, and how many ladies are pregnant. How many 5-year-old children are there and after keeping complete data of everyone, they will tell you --- Page 19 --- when you will get vaccinated and when will you have to go. It means a lot and is much better than earlier. No pregnant lady is left unvaccinated and is not prone to any diseases or illness.” - Community inﬂuencers, Chattisgarh “During the rainy season, our community health workers will be the ones to gather information on their assigned area. We also prepared a set of medicines we give to BHERT and the 24/7 lying-in so that in case the health center is closed, the resident can still avail it. In addition, it is the BHW who will go house-to-house and facilitate the provision of health services to those who need it.” - Community member FGD, Philippines A strategy that was unique to the Philippines, was the incentivization of immunization-seeking behavior by tying them with health and other services available from the health center. Consistent and diligent efforts to make the community aware of the importance of vaccination and to dispel any myths and misconceptions also played a crucial role in ensuring the delivery of on-time services. In addition to this, awareness activities were also carried out on the impact of climate change, disease surge, and climate-mediated health outcomes as well. “Previously, during immunization campaigns, we had to visit households to inform parents about their children&amp;#x27;s immunization needs, after which they would bring their children to the Barangay Health Station (BHS). However, with the establishment of the Barangay Health Center, now, when there&amp;#x27;s a scheduled immunization session, parents voluntarily bring their children to the Barangay Health Center. This is because if they attempt to obtain any certiﬁcations from the barangay, they will be denied due to their non-compliance with bringing their child for immunization. Failure to comply means you won&amp;#x27;t receive certiﬁcations or assistance from the barangay until you adhere to the immunization schedule. This approach ensures that residents understand the importance of immunization and encourages compliance. It also allows us to hold back assistance, such as during gift-giving events until they comply with the immunization schedule or any other health-related activities where their cooperation is required” - Frontline Workers FGD, Philippines “The effect of weather change affects the trend of vaccination among communities. The people don’t come for vaccination during the extreme heat. So we hold sessions to inform them on what can be done to deal with some of the side effects. We also give them examples from previous years, like the measles outbreak. We educate them on what will happen when they don’t vaccinate their kids; like if you don’t go to the sub-centre your child will not get vitamin A, and there is a chance of disability and eye disease.It may seem like it’s scary, but they understand and then they attend the camps” - Frontline Worker FGD, Chhattisgarh --- Page 20 --- It was also discussed how communities and stakeholders recognized the importance of preserving the ecosystem and environment in building resilient communities, especially in the wake of increasing disasters. Participants shared how a voluntary culture of environment conservation was practiced to prevent and mitigate the effects of any future disasters and outbreaks. “Recently, we conducted a tree planting activity with the schoolchildren to help mitigate the effects of climate change like ﬂooding. We also educate people on the effects of use of Styrofoam to the ozone (layer). We also inform them about the importance of proper disposal so that the canals aren’t clogged up by trash” - Community Member, Bagong Silangan “The barangay has tree planting activities in Sitio Bakal. These activities are coordinated by the DENR and involve NGOs. We&amp;#x27;ve also been able to engage high school students through partnerships with schools.&amp;quot; We banned cutting of trees in our area because there are very few of them left. Our mountainous place is prone to disasters. We prohibit tree cutting” - Community Member, Baguio Measures for better preparedness and planning This theme summarises the efforts undertaken in all 3 countries towards preparing for climate variability and disaster response mechanisms to ensure continuity of services, especially essential services like vaccination highlighting both successes and areas for improvement. While frontline workers across various locations reported well-functioning health facilities and response teams, there needs to be more coordination, training, and resource allocation as indicated by the participant narratives. There were indications from health workers as well as representatives of the beneﬁciary groups that having dedicated resources is crucial to ensuring continuity of services, especially during extreme weather events and disasters. The narratives also indicated that building the capacity of the frontline workers and responders was imperative to the effectiveness and success of any response and service delivery. “There should be a policy to ensure enough hiring of sufﬁcient healthcare staff to augment the workforce. Even one health staff per barangay is good. Right now, they can be pulled out anytime because they are not permanent. In my opinion, someone should be manning the cold chain facility and health services. Someone should be assigned there anytime so we’re ready once a typhoon hits. The health workers must also work consistently. There should not be delays. If the vaccine is available, it should be given to the target and prioritized clients. There should also be --- Page 21 --- an appeal to orient the barangay council so that they can also help with this” - Frontline workers FGD, Philippines “During the ﬂood, we have a dedicated team, trained. Despite their training, there are still areas where the team lacks effectiveness, indicating room for improvement in disaster response strategies and coordination” - Medical Ofﬁcer KII, Assam Participants spoke at length regarding the overall need to improve the social determinants of health including access to healthcare in general which has a signiﬁcant impact on the overall health-seeking behavior of communities and more so during variations in climate patterns. The respondents also indicated that there have to be systematic processes in place to ensure that there is an adequate supply of vaccines at the facilities to meet the demands of the communities&amp;#x27; post-awareness campaigns and such. There have been multiple instances when frontline workers reported that individuals didn’t receive vaccines even after they reached facilities as communicated by the frontline workers, which further affected the trust of the communities in the system. “First, for health, we need a health sub-center. We need a hospital, we need a readily available doctor that we can consult anytime if we feel sick, and we need a medical store too, so that we can easily access the medicines we need. Next, we need a bridge over the river at Gadhua Ghat, we need access to electricity as well, an Anganwadi center, we need better farming equipment from the government because most of the villagers are farmers. We need training on how to stay healthy, how to take care of kids, how to keep them away from diseases, and how to wash hands, we need training on this. We need everything, they promised to give everything when they came asking for the vote, but after the election, they forgot their promises. We need many things but if they fulﬁll basic needs we can live a better life. You want us to attend camps, I can’t do anything without this” - Community member FGD, Assam, India “The vaccine supply at the health center is limited. How can we provide vaccines to constituents if the supply is limited? Even if you educate them, if there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine available at the center, they will get upset. Especially during COVID-19, they always said that they wouldn&amp;#x27;t be accepted at the hospital without a vaccine. We endorse it and then there&amp;#x27;s no vaccine. Even for students, it&amp;#x27;s the same, they need a vaccine card to enter. So when they rushed to get vaccinated, there wasn&amp;#x27;t enough vaccine in the barangay. So, let&amp;#x27;s look at the gaps, what&amp;#x27;s lacking, like the shortage of supply. Perhaps this should be brought to the attention of higher authorities that these gaps need attention in the community for better services” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines Stakeholders across the countries thought that an integrated plan involving stakeholders from multiple departments would be instrumental in an effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services like vaccination. Another factor cited to be most --- Page 22 --- critical to the success of complete immunization and efﬁcient service delivery was the use of data and rigorous MIS and reporting systems that help understand the gaps and plan better. “Collaborative efforts between various stakeholders will be crucial in addressing the evolving challenges effectively. Collaborating with other departments can ensure essential equipment such as boats and life jackets are available during relief efforts. Furthermore, in partnership with the health department, we supply necessary medications and provide care to most affected communities. This collaborative effort ensures that the most vulnerable receive necessary care and support during times of crisis: - District Disaster Management Authority KII, Assam “We need to improve the reporting system to ensure that success indicators are truthful, such as comparing the projected population with the actual population reached. This is crucial for the success of vaccination efforts” - Frontline worker FGD, Philippines DISCUSSION The ﬁndings from this mixed methods study on vaccine inequity and climate change among vulnerable groups in these 3 countries highlighted the current status of vaccine access, what drives access and nuanced interplay between climate change and vaccine inequity among vulnerable populations, and how it tested the resilience of communities and health systems. While the surveys highlighted that the majority of the participants were aware of the age-appropriate vaccination schedule and reported high vaccination rates among children, there were signiﬁcant challenges to vaccination access like distance from the centers, extreme weather events, unavailability of transport, and illness. In addition to accessibility challenges, factors like fear of vaccines and side effects, and lack of awareness of vaccine availability contribute to partial or non-vaccination of children leading to vaccine-preventable illnesses and possible outbreaks in the communities they live in. The proximity of vaccination sites and the ease of access play crucial roles in vaccination uptake, emphasizing the need for decentralized and easily accessible vaccination services, especially in remote areas. Addressing fear using systematic information and building trust is another key factor in addressing hesitancy and improving vaccine uptake among the most vulnerable as evident in the existing literature. The ﬁndings from the community-based surveys as well as discussions and interviews with the key stakeholders outlined the role of climate change in exacerbating existing inequities affecting livelihoods and other social determinants of health like access to healthcare, education, etc. Extreme weather events cause a double burden by disrupting --- Page 23 --- service delivery, causing delays in vaccination, and leading to an increased susceptibility to vaccine-preventable illnesses as well as an increase in climate-mediated health issues. Subsets of the populations that are much more vulnerable like pregnant women, the elderly, and children are disproportionately affected and bear the brunt of these impacts, warranting the need for targeted interventions to minimize the effects and mitigate them faster for better resilience. The study also captured mechanisms adopted by the communities and administration to improve vaccination services in general and cope with the impact of climate change. Strategies to take services to the doorstep of communities, encourage community participation, and build their knowledge through targeted campaigns seemed to motivate communities and improve their access to vaccination despite weather-related challenges. Additionally, the ﬁndings also indicated that intersectoral collaboration and coordination, efﬁcient planning, and resource allocation are important to ensure effective crisis response and sustained delivery of essential services which build resilience of the most vulnerable populations. The ﬁndings underscore the importance of addressing geographical, cultural, and systemic challenges to ensure equitable access to vaccination services, especially during extreme weather events. Climate change poses an unparalleled threat to humanity through direct pathways like temperature rise, altered patterns of precipitation as well as extreme weather events like droughts, ﬂoods, heat waves, etc. Climate-induced events can also impact human health negatively through indirect pathways by causing population displacement and disrupting access to health services, water, sanitation, and hygiene to cite a few examples. Systematically addressing challenges in accessing services like vaccination and building climate-resilient healthcare systems are essential for improving universal health coverage and protecting the most vulnerable communities. Further rigorous studies and evidence generation systems that assess the climate resilience levels of communities and ongoing response and coping mechanisms is necessary to design and implement targeted interventions to protect the most vulnerable populations and build resilient healthcare systems for the future.</Content>

The objective of the intervention is aimed at improving the livelihoods of 1000 participating tribal families through the promotion of an integrated farming system based on the Agro-Horti-Forestry ([Client Project]) approach. This objective is envisaged to be achieved by focusing on development of underutilized lands through soil and water conservation, plantation of horticulture and forestry trees and cultivation of suitable short gestation crops/ intercrops. Capacity building of [CLIENT PROJECT] farmers and formation and strengthening of a collective of [CLIENT PROJECT] farmers is another objective of the project. [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] has partnered with Catalyst Management Services (CMS), Bangalore to conduct a baseline study for the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention. The purpose of this baseline study is to map the current status of water, land and soil conservation practices and current agricultural and agro-forestry practices with a focus on collecting data from both treatment and control groups so as to enable impact evaluation of the project at the endline. Extensive socio-economic and demographic proﬁling of the tribal communities with a special focus on women and other marginalised communities has been done in this study. Mapping these baseline values would potentially enable effective measurement of the project&amp;#x27;s outcome and impact at the endline on indicators like increase in income, water availability, and agricultural production. An inception report with detailed research methodology guided the research objectives for the baseline study in terms of capturing short term and long term indicators as prescribed in the RFP. The sampling strategy and the survey instruments were adopted in line with the principles of ensuring representation of population in the universe, in this case the targeted farmers in implementation villages and engaging with the key stakeholders in the villages to validate and counter-validate information. To ensure that the impact estimated at the endline is unbiased and only attributable to the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention and no other phenomenon, people from 2 3 --- Page 5 --- groups namely treatment and control have been surveyed (as necessitated by the Difference-in-Differences method of impact evaluation). Accordingly, 179 farmers from treatment areas and 132 farmers from comparison areas have been surveyed for the study. This baseline report presents quantitative ﬁndings and the applicable qualitative snippets pertaining to the various sections of the study. Baseline values of the outcomes of the program have been mapped using indicators on socioeconomic status, demographic pattern, landholding types, agriculture and natural resource management practices of the treatment households. These ﬁndings reveal that for the treatment group, 56.42% of the sample belong to the below poverty line (BPL) category. A typical farmer’s median total land holding is 100 guntha which comprises their own land and land titles given by the government under FRA (Forest Rights Act). More than half of the 179 people surveyed (86.52%) are small and marginal farmers owning up to 200 guntha land and earning a median annual income of Rs. 85,000 which is mainly accrued from farming or working as an agricultural or migrant laborer. Baseline agricultural indicators 1 testify that the majority respondents are subsistence farmers with 100% of them cultivating in the Kharif season. Paddy is the primary crop grown (by 98.31% respondents) but most retain it for self-consumption and don’t sell it in the market. Tuvar and Urad dal are the other crops grown in the kharif season. 95.50% farmers take more than 1 crop in the kharif season. Tindora (Ivy gourd) is the main revenue generating crop and is grown by about 25.28% respondents in the kharif season and 14.71% respondents in the rabi season. 70.22% of all farmers are fully dependent on rain. About 29.77% of the respondents are able to irrigate their ﬁelds. Given this fact, it is hardly surprising to note that only 38.20% practice agriculture in the rabi season. 90.45% people report ‘lack of water’ as their primary agricultural challenge with 46.24% stating that they require irrigation facilities in months other than the Kharif season. These months then witness about 35.75% of the respondents migrating to far-off places for odd jobs citing no work in the villages and better employment opportunities outside as their main reasons for doing so 2 . Indicators pertaining to natural resource management show that not more than 30% of the 53 people using irrigation facilities told of practicing water conservation measures. Farm bunding is the preferred practice for conserving land and soil and is practiced by about 68.54% of the 179 respondents. The outcomes of the project that determine its sustainability have been tracked using indicators related to status of community institutions like FPOs, water user groups and [CLIENT PROJECT] tukdis in the treatment areas. 99.44% of the 179 respondents asserted that they were not a member of any producer collective with only 18.99% knowing of the presence of one in their village or block. Similarly, 97.21% respondents reported not being a member of any water user group formed for the purpose of conservation of water resources. Thus, the study did not ﬁnd any conclusive evidence of effectively functioning water user groups or farmer producer organizations (FPO) in the area supported by government agencies or by other NGOs. 2 All the percentages quoted in the executive summary are based on the survey of 179 households in the treatment at the baseline . 1 All the percentages quoted in the executive summary are based on the survey of 179 households in the treatment at the baseline . 4 --- Page 6 --- 73.74% of the 179 sampled farmers claimed that they are a part of the [CLIENT PROJECT] tukdis formed for the purpose of successfully executing and sustaining the [CLIENT PROJECT] program. This result can be substantiated given the fact that the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention has already been initiated in many treatment villages. Another interesting fact to be noted is that even prior to the [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] intervention, about 65.92% farmers claim to currently have their own agroforestry cultivation with most people having about 15 mango trees approximately (median). A comparative study of the treatment and comparison groups is another important aim of this study. Key ﬁndings from the comparative analysis suggests that the average landholding at 118.94 guntha and income per acre at Rs. 13393.37 is higher for the treatment group (with respect to 88.92 guntha (average landholding) and Rs 8770 (income per acre) for the control group) while migration at 51.52% is higher for the comparison group as against 35.75% for the treatment group. The table given below lists the baseline values of a few important indicators (for both treatment and control groups) and their standard values (based on secondary data) across various domains. Indicator category Parameter Baseline data - June 2021 (Treatment) Baseline data - June 2021 (Control) Standard (Secondary Data) Livelihood and income Below Poverty line households (%) 56.42% 68.94% 70% Annual migration rate 35.75% 51.52% 45% Agriculture Percentage of cultivated land irrigated 13.03% 3.54% 23.40% Yield of paddy in the year (kg/guntha) 17.50 15.00 21.84 Farmers cultivating in the rabi season (%) 38.20% 27.27% Percentage of farmers practicing rainfed agriculture in the region 70.22% 91.67% Cropping intensity 111.36% 109.52% 117.00% Agro-forestry WADI land area covered with soil conservation practices (%) 29.72% 37.01% Annual employment days in Agroforestry 120.00 60.00 Table No. 1: Baseline indicators for treatment, control and secondary data 3 Based on some of the above indicators and a few others (for community institutions), an Agroforestry development index has been created. The value of the index for the baseline data comes out to be 0.67 (for treatment) and 0.50 (for comparison group) while it is found to be 0.79 for the secondary data at the district level (sourced primarily from documents sent by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]). According to the index, on the whole, Valsad district seems to be performing better as compared to the community in Dharampur block in the areas of livelihood, agriculture and 3 All the percentages quoted in the table are based on the survey of 179 households in the treatment and 132 households in the comparison group at the baseline . 5 --- Page 7 --- agroforestry cumulatively . However, within the treatment and comparison groups surveyed in the block, the treatment group seems to be better off than the comparison group (The index calculation is given in the appendix). A similar index will have to be calculated at the endline to comprehensively measure the progress of the community relative to the baseline values. A logical framework analysis (LFA) has been prepared for the [CLIENT PROJECT] project by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] (attached in the appendix) which enlists the outputs, outcomes and impact expected out of the project. Few indicators of the LFA which necessitate values at the baseline have been given in the table below: LFA Indicators Baseline value Remark Yield per unit land (Paddy) 17.5 Kg/guntha Median Yield per unit land (Urad dal) 1 Kg/guntha Yield per unit land (Tuvar dal) 1 Kg/guntha Yield per unit land (Ragi) 4 Kg/guntha Yield per unit land (Tindora) 132 Kg/guntha Number of people migrating 35.75% 64 out of 179 Total number of person-days of migration (male) 87 days Median Total land (barren) 410 guntha Barren land as a percentage of total land 1.93% Employment days in Agroforestry/ agriculture/ farm activities 100 days Median % respondents claiming that their soil quality is good 29.78% N = 178 % respondents claiming that their soil quality is average 65.73% N = 178 Days spent cutting wood (dependence on the forest for wood) 1 day Median Hours spent cutting wood (dependence on the forest for wood) 2 hours Median Overall income of the household (gross) Rs. 85,000 Median Overall income of the household (net) Rs. 25,000 Median Agricultural income of the household Rs. 20,000 Median % respondents claiming that they face climate risks 73.03% N = 178 % respondents claiming that they face the risk of soil erosion 66.15% N = 178 % respondents claiming that they face the risk of excessive and unseasonal rains 62.31% N = 178 6 --- Page 8 --- Number of farmers having membership of the FPO/ Cooperative 1 N = 179 Number of farmers claiming to members of a wadi tukdi 132 N = 179 % Respondents having undergone 1 or 2 trainings on horticulture 22.54% N = 179 Number of farmers claiming to members of a water user group 5 N = 179 % of respondents currently having some agroforestry trees 65.92% N = 179 Present number of mango trees 15 Median Table no. 2: Baseline values for LFA indicators The baseline ﬁndings conclusively corroborate the need for an agroforestry project as a way to sustainably enhance people&amp;#x27;s incomes by converting under-utilized land into a productive asset, by increasing the number and coverage of water and land conservation structures while also reducing distressed migration. Given that no FPO currently operates in the treatment villages, leveraging the power of the collective and forming an FPO to market and sell the [CLIENT PROJECT] produce becomes necessary. Capacity buildings of people and institutions need to be done for the interventions to yield a long-term impact. Recommendations to the programme design Based on the ﬁndings of the baseline survey, we propose the following recommendations for the successful execution of the [CLIENT PROJECT] program. a) Impact evaluation at the endline : With the intention of using the Difference-in-Differences method of impact evaluation at the endline, two groups namely treatment and control have been surveyed at the baseline (A short note on DID has been added in the appendix for reference). Surveying two such groups is required so that the impact measured at the endline can only be attributed to the intervention while the effects of all other factors affecting the impact indicators will be nulliﬁed. Also, DID can only be used provided the two groups show parallel trends (i.e. similar patterns of socioeconomic growth) prior to the baseline. However, considerable differences between the treatment and control groups have been observed in the baseline study. A t-test was conducted on the data to check for signiﬁcant differences between the means of some important characteristics of the treatment and control groups (results attached in appendix). T-test results indicate signiﬁcant differences between the two groups on parameters like annual income, total and cultivated land and migration. Apart from this evidence coming from the quantitative data, qualitative information received from [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] (attestation can be found in the appendix) also points towards inherent dissimilarities between the groups. Firstly, the comparison villages are located on a more hilly and undulating terrain as compared to the 7 --- Page 9 --- treatment group which leads to people in the treatment villages having more privately owned land although the FRA land is similarly allocated in both sets of villages. Secondly, 1 big developmental project was implemented by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] in the treatment villages more than 15-20 years ago which made people in these areas favourably biased towards participating in projects for their socioeconomic development in contrast to people living in comparison areas. This hesitancy of the people residing in comparison villages (especially Tanasiya and Mamabhacha) to participate in developmental initiatives is also exacerbated by the fact that they are under heavy inﬂuence of the Satipati cult. The cult propagates self-rule and asks its members to refuse to be a part of any activity undertaken by the state or central government. All these factors have led to the poor development of the comparison areas as compared to the treatment areas. Thus, evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data clearly shows that the comparison group surveyed is not a valid comparison group for the treatment group. Given that the two groups have inherent differences, the parallel trends assumption will not be satisﬁed. So, it is not possible to use the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method for evaluating the impact of the [CLIENT PROJECT] project at the endline. In such a case, Propensity Score Matching (PSM) could be done by surveying a larger pool of respondents at the endline, in turn creating an artiﬁcial comparison group based on their propensity to participate in the program and matching those with the treatment respondents to evaluate outcomes (Note on PSM attached in the appendix). Another potential method of evaluating the program is by using the instrumental variables (IV) technique. IV is a 2 stage regression used in cases where we have incomplete compliance or voluntary enrolment in the program. For this, a random sample needs to be surveyed only at the endline and an instrumental variable that inﬂuences the likelihood of participating in a program, but is outside of the participant’s control and is unrelated to the participant’s characteristics needs to be chosen for doing the 2-step regression. b) The baseline study ﬁnds that problems like higher migration, lesser landholdings, irrigation challenges and lower incomes that the [CLIENT PROJECT] project intends to address are more prevalent in the comparison villages than the treatment villages. Hence, going ahead, it could be advisable to also implement the [CLIENT PROJECT] project in villages similar to the comparison villages. However, it is important to note that the project should not be implemented in the comparison villages used for the purpose of this study as it will induce bias in the impact evaluation results of this [CLIENT PROJECT] project if the evaluation methodology of DID is used. c) Emphasis on institution building : Although backward linkage with Pindval Cooperative and forward linkage with VAPCOL for all the [CLIENT PROJECT] farmers is an important component of the project, special emphasis needs to be laid on capacity building of farmers and the subsequent formation of a collective of the [CLIENT PROJECT] farmers. This is so because it was found in the baseline study that almost all farmers (99.44%) from the treatment group (N = 179) reported not being a part of any farmer interest group (FIG) or farmer producer organization (FPO) presently. Also, only 18.99% farmers claimed that they knew of an FPO or FIG in their village or block. Given these statistics, a lot of ground work 8 --- Page 10 --- needs to be done, ﬁrstly, to make people understand the concept of a cooperative and let them know how they can beneﬁt by being a part of it. Hence, this process of institution building needs to start from day 1. Once this foundation has been established, only then can the marketing linkages with other organizations be created successfully and sustainably. Also, for the FPO to sustain in the long run, the FPO should trade in other value chains as well besides the [CLIENT PROJECT] produce. This will ensure that overall the FPO can engage in a higher volume of business and diversify its income sources. For example, if the [CLIENT PROJECT] produce is getting a lower price in the market then the FPO can possibly earn a proﬁt by trading in other crops which are getting a higher price. Also, the FPO would have a higher number of shareholders if it includes members besides the [CLIENT PROJECT] farmers. Thus, given the potential multifold advantages of an FPO, the focus on institution building becomes pivotal and needs to be stressed upon. d) Hydrogeological mapping of the project area : To measure the improvement in quality of land and soil due the necessary conservation initiatives and the increase in ground water levels due to development of water resources, it is imperative to do a hydrogeological mapping of the project area. Hydrogeological mapping of the area is essential to scientiﬁcally gauge the enhancement in land and water quality of the region. 1. Introduction Background of the [CLIENT PROJECT] project [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] Gujarat is implementing one of it’s ﬂagship projects - Agro-Forestry ([Client Project]) - in Dharampur block of Valsad district in Gujarat. The project aims to cover 1000 families under this project from the period of November 2020 to October 2023. The rural household is the unit of intervention under the programme. The [CLIENT PROJECT] Project focuses on development of underutilized lands through soil and water conservation, thereby resulting in plantation of horticulture and forestry trees and cultivation of suitable short gestation crops/ intercrops. At the end of the gestation period of the trees and the crops, they are expected to become productive; the income from which will enable the rural family to come out of poverty sustainably. Under the project, each participant family takes up intensive land development and plantation work on around one acre of wasteland or marginal land, to convert it into a productive asset. The work to be done on [CLIENT PROJECT] plots involves land shaping through bunds, trenches, digging and ﬁlling of pits, fencing, plantation of fruit and forestry saplings, water resource development, improved agricultural practices, aftercare of plantations etc. Forestry species are planted on the boundaries of the [Client Project], serving as a windbreak for the fruit trees and a source of timber, fodder and fuel wood. The species to be planted are chosen according to their suitability to the project area, their economic value and the preferences of the participating families. The project aims to improve the livelihoods of 1000 participating tribal families through the promotion of an integrated farming system based on the Agro-Horti-Forestry ([Client Project]) approach. The speciﬁc objectives of the project are: 9 --- Page 11 --- ● Enhanced capacity of [Client Project] farmers on improved agriculture practices ● Promoting Integrated Farming system based on [Client Project] approach. ● Formation and strengthening of groups / cooperatives / FPOs beneﬁting [Client Project] farmers. Research Methodology a) Research objectives The purpose of the baseline study is to have a comprehensive study for establishing current status of both short term and long term indicators of the project. With the aim of evaluating the project&amp;#x27;s impact at the endline, the given set of indicators have been mapped for both the treatment and the comparison villages. The baseline reports will enable measurement of the project’s outcomes and impacts, as committed in the project’s agreement. The speciﬁc objectives of the baseline study are as follows : ● Document the socio-economic proﬁle of villages and households of the project area. ● Analyse the current status of various livelihood opportunities of the households. ● Establish and document the base values of the project’s indicators in relation to the various stated objectives and impact areas. ● Recommend improvements in project MIS and other documentations. b) Research design and sampling The baseline assessment of the project employed a mixed-methods approach where the data was collected from farmers and other stakeholders of the project using quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative evaluation answered the questions related to performance of key project indicators both from an input/output to outcome/impact perspective. It was envisaged to collect data from both these sets of people - treatment and control - at the baseline so that the [CLIENT PROJECT] project&amp;#x27;s impact could be measured at the endline. Of the 12 villages namely Avdha, Bopi, Chasmandva, Choravni, Ganva, Hanmatmal, Jagiri, Khamdahad, Molaamba, Nadagdhari, Rajpuri Jungle and Sajanibarda wherein the [CLIENT PROJECT] project is being implemented, 3 villages namely Avdha, Bopi and Hanmatmal were selected for sampling based on the population of the villages. Further selection of treatment households for baseline sampling is done in accordance with the number of people chosen for the [CLIENT PROJECT] project in a given village. Accordingly, 179 households are sampled from the 3 villages of Avdha, Bopi and Hanmatmal and from a total of 800 households from 12 villages. For the household surveys, a probability-based random-sampling method was adopted. Given that the project engages with 1,000 households, the sample size with a conﬁdence interval of 5% percentage point at 95% conﬁdence level was chosen. Primary research was the core of the methodology and included extensive data collection through ﬁeld visits, with the objective of thorough process documentation. Along with a structured survey, we conducted unstructured qualitative interactions with the relevant stakeholders, like rural livelihood farmers, [Client Project] (Agri-Horticultural) farmers including women farmers and women labourers, to derive insights that would bolster our understanding of the interventions by 10 --- Page 12 --- identifying and documenting key steps, factors and processes during the program implementation and activities that help in achieving the target. The research also reﬂects on the quality of the training and capacity building approaches. The survey tools used for execution of the research design are depicted in the ﬁgure below: Figure No. 1: Survey tools used in the baseline Similarly, 3 comparison group villages namely Nirpan, Tanasiya and Mamabhacha were identiﬁed with a total of 478 households were identiﬁed and weighted random sampling was employed to select 132 households at 95% conﬁdence level and 5% conﬁdence interval. 2. Area proﬁle The [CLIENT PROJECT] project is going to be implemented in villages of Dharampur block in Valsad district of state of Gujarat. The programme villages are representative of a typical situation of backward tribal areas in South Gujarat. The villages are characterized by hilly and undulating topography. The villages face severe water scarcity despite receiving nearly 2000 mm rainfall annually. The primary occupation of the community is subsistence agriculture. A map of the Dharampur block inValsad district is as shown below: 11 --- Page 13 --- Figure No. 2: Map of Valsad district 3. Demographic proﬁle For the [CLIENT PROJECT] project baseline study, a total of 179 individuals from 3 treatment villages namely Avdha, Bopi and Hamatmal and 132 individuals from 3 comparison villages namely Mamabhacha, Nirpan and Tanasiya have been surveyed. The village wise distribution of the people from the treatment villages is as shown below: Treatment Bopi Avdha Hanmatmal Total Respondents surveyed 90 45 44 179 12 --- Page 14 --- Figure No. 3: Sampling distribution for treatment a) Age and Gender The distribution of the respondents according to their age is shown in the graph below : Figure No. 4: Age-wise distribution (Treatment; N = 179 ) From the above graph, it can be observed that the majority of the respondents (77.65%) are from the working age group of 31 years to 60 years. Also, the treatment population is well-represented by a sample consisting of 82.12% men and 17.88% women. 13 --- Page 15 --- b) Religion and caste 98.88% of the sampled population of 179 households is Hindu and 100% of these Hindus identify themselves as scheduled tribes. Only 1 person informed that he was a Christian. 3 people (1.68%) were unaware of their caste or the religious beliefs that they adhered to. c) Ration card ownership From the ration card ownership status of the respondents, it can be inferred that 56.42% of the people are from the BPL (Below Poverty Line) category while 42.46% people are from the APL (Above Poverty Line) category. This socio-economic categorization of the respondents is represented in the pie chart shown below : Figure No. 5: Ration card ownership status (Treatment; N = 179) However, the 2011 Tendulkar Committee report determined that a person who is spending only about Rs. 27 a day in rural areas lives below the poverty line. If we go by this deﬁnition, it is found from the data collected on expenditure that only 8 people (4.47%) spend about Rs. 27 per day and are actually living below the poverty line as against 56.42% depicted by the ration card ownership status. d) Education level Respondent’s education level The respondent’s education level is depicted in the graph below : 14 --- Page 16 --- Figure No. 6: Respondent’s education level (Treatment; N =179) From the above graph, it can be seen that 56.98% of the respondents reported that they are illiterate whereas 10.61%, 10.61%, 11.73% and 7.82% people said that they had completed their primary, middle, secondary and higher secondary school education respectively. Children’s education level With a mean of 2.03, collectively, the total number of children that the respondents in the sample have is 366. The schooling status of these children is shown in the graph below: 15 --- Page 17 --- Figure No. 7: Children’s education level (Treatment; N = 366) It can be noted from the graph that while 20.77% of the children are toddlers, the rest 77.32% are presently enrolled in a school. 4. Economic proﬁle a) Household characteristics The median number of people residing in a typical household in the treatment area is 6. The average number of children in such households is found to be 2. b) Occupation proﬁle Farming and farm-based allied activities form the primary occupation of 51.96% of the respondents. Other respondents list agricultural and daily wage labor (24.58%) and migration (8.38%) as their primary occupation. Distribution of respondents based on their primary occupation is as shown in the table below: Primary Occupation Frequency Percent Self-employed 10 5.59% Farming (Agriculture/ Horticulture/ Agroforestry) 67 37.43% Farm-based allied activities (e.g. livestock rearing) 26 14.53% Agricultural labour 25 13.97% Daily wage labour 19 10.61% 16 --- Page 18 --- Pvt./govt. service (teacher, ASHA, AWW etc.) 14 7.82% Remittances 1 0.56% Migrant labourer / Seasonal labourer 15 8.38% Others 2 1.12% Total 179 100.00% Table No. 3: Primary Occupation proﬁle (Treatment; N = 179) From the above table, it can be noted that about 48.04% of the respondent households do not engage in farming or allied activities as their primary occupation despite living in the rural areas. These people mainly seem to be working as agricultural or migrant laborers to earn their daily bread. This fact substantiates the need for the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention because of which people will be gainfully self-employed and not depend on doing odd jobs or migrating outside their villages for earning a major chunk of their income. c) Household income and expenses Income The median annual income of a normal household in the project area is found to be Rs. 85,000. The distribution of respondents according to their annual incomes is a depicted in the graph below: Figure No. 8: Income distribution (Treatment; N =179) The majority, 63.16%, earn anywhere between Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 1,00,000 annually. Only 1 person reported earning between 4 lakh to 5 lakh. Given that a majority earns below Rs. 1 lakh, these households can be further subdivided into income categories as shown below: 17 --- Page 19 --- Figure No. 9: Income distribution for households earning below 1 lakh (Treatment, N = 113) Due to the inherent instability associated with agricultural income, villagers generally diversify their sources of income by working as agricultural laborers, migrating outside the village during the lean months or getting remittances and/ or money from the government. The median contribution of these income sources to the overall household income is as given below: Contribution to income from different sources Frequency Mean (Rs) Median (Rs) Self employed 27 58,403.70 40,000.00 Farming 111 29,772.12 20,000.00 Farm based activities (goatry, milk farming, livestock rearing etc.) 57 54,912.28 49,000.00 Agricultural labour 86 28,025.58 18,000.00 Daily wage labour 58 54,653.45 41,000.00 Salaried work 31 85,167.74 84,000.00 Remittance 3 81,666.67 70,000.00 Migrant labour 56 41,728.57 30,000.00 Government subsidies / pensions 17 11,341.18 6,000.00 Others 3 68,666.67 3,000.00 Annual household income 179 107,028.50 85,000.00 Per capita income 179 18,920.59 14,285.71 Table No. 4: Respondent’s income sources diversiﬁcation status (Treatment) 18 --- Page 20 --- From the table, it can be inferred that for the majority respondents from the project villages, the income diversity comes mainly from farming and farm based activities, agricultural/ daily wage labour and migration. A handful of people who are self-employed or work in private jobs earn signiﬁcantly higher than the rest, thus increasing the mean annual income of the group considerably. The median per capita income for the cluster is found to be Rs. 18,921 which is less than half of Rs. 40,925 - the per capita income of rural India. The per capita income is lower even in the light of higher diversiﬁcation of income sources. Given this fact, the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention becomes important since it has potential to help increase the per capita income while reducing income source diversiﬁcation. Expenditure The median annual expenditure of the treatment villages is found to be Rs. 60,000. The median income versus expenditure proﬁling for the treatment areas is as given below: Figure No. 10: Respondents income and expenditure comparison (Treatment) For the 179 respondents, food and living expenses constitute the ﬁrst major expenditure for the maximum number of respondents (81.01%) followed by expenses on agriculture (43.58%), healthcare (27.93%) and children’s education (17.32%). d) Loan and savings pattern Even though 85.47% of the 179 sampled people acknowledged that they have a functional bank account, only 34.58% of the respondents mentioned that they save some money on a regular or irregular basis; with Rs 1000 being the amount of money saved on average per month. A majority (60.89%) claimed that they do not save any money at all. About 17.32% of the respondents reported that they currently have an outstanding loan to be cleared. Of these, about 67.74% of individuals said that they take loans from formal sources while the others (32.26%) told of taking loans from informal sources. Financing of agriculture and business related expenses have been mentioned as the primary reasons for borrowing money by them. 19 --- Page 21 --- e) Asset ownership pattern The asset ownership pattern of the treatment group is depicted in the graph below: Figure No. 11: Respondent’s asset ownership pattern (Treatment; N = 179) It can be evidenced from the above graph that about 98.88% of the sampled population own some agricultural land while 100% have access to electricity. 73.18% of people rear livestock. However, the penetration of other assets like ownership of mobile phones or vehicles is not as high. 5. Agriculture 99.44% of the 179 people sampled from the treatment area asserted that they actively practice agriculture. People in the region practice subsistence agriculture, and all of them mainly cultivate their land in the kharif season. Overall, the total area cultivated in the kharif season is 15,337.00 gunthas. On an average, the people are involved for 3 to 4 months (mean : 111.29 days) in agriculture. The number of people gainfully employed in farming through the different months of the year is as shown below: 20 --- Page 22 --- Figure No. 12: Respondents agriculture employment pattern (Treatment; N = 178) a) Land and soil status Land status Most of the farmers residing in the project area are small and marginal, with the majority of them (86.52%) owning up to 200 gunthas (5 acres) of land. The rest (about 13.48%) seem to be large farmers and own land ranging from 201 to 500 gunthas (5.01 to 12.5 acres). The community’s land ownership pattern can be visualized as shown below: 21 --- Page 23 --- Figure No. 13: Respondent’s land ownership pattern (Treatment; N = 178) By virtue of its location in the western ghats, the villages have an undulating topography with huge tracts of land being forested. It can be evidenced from the data that generally people have their own land (reported by 92.18% respondents) and about 73.18% respondents have also been given land titles by the government under the Forest Rights Act (FRA). The landholding summary statistics are as given below: Land ownership pattern Observations Mean Median max min sd Land owned (guntha) 165 85.87 70.00 500.00 0.00 73.34 Land leased (guntha) 1 60.00 60.00 60.00 60.00 0.00 Land shared (guntha) 2 22.00 22.00 40.00 4.00 25.46 Land FRA (guntha) 131 43.43 40.00 302.00 0.00 36.78 Land other (guntha) 14 57.21 40.00 140.00 4.00 42.78 Land barren (guntha) 146 2.81 0.00 80.00 0.00 11.83 Land total (guntha) 178 118.94 100.00 500.00 10.00 79.14 Land cultivable (guntha) 178 110.46 90.00 500.00 10.00 75.34 Land cultivated (guntha) 178 106.78 84.50 500.00 0.00 72.71 Land irrigated (guntha) 53 46.74 40.00 268.00 1.00 51.84 No land 1 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Table No. 5: Respondents landholding summary (Treatment) From the above table, it can be observed that about 92.69% of people (i.e. 165 of 178) own approximately 70 or more gunthas of land on average with 73.59% of the sample (i.e. 131 of 178) 22 --- Page 24 --- having got another 40 gunthas of land under FRA. 7.86% of the sample farm on ‘other’ land, which can be interpreted as land that has no legally determined ownership. Also, it can be inferred that almost all land that is cultivable (mean = 110.46 guntha) is being cultivated (mean = 106.78 guntha) with hardly any barren land being available. However, only 29.77% of all farmers irrigate most of their cultivable land. For those who are able to irrigate their ﬁelds, the mean irrigation area (to cultivable area) percentage is 38.76%. The land proﬁling is as is illustrated in the diagram shown below: Figure No. 14: Total land proﬁling (Treatment) From the above diagram, it can be noted that the amount of barren land (i.e. total minus cultivated land) that can be brought under cultivation is 1511 guntha. So, considering 179 respondents, on average, for a farmer, the potential for increasing his area under cultivation is 8.44 gunthas. Soil status 89.89% of the 178 people engaged in farming do not have soil health cards and a mere 7.30% have got their soil health scientiﬁcally tested. Also, 29.78% of people opine that their soil quality is good while another 65.73% of the sampled people feel that it is of mediocre quality. Land and soil conservation measures Soil and land conservation measures are undertaken essentially to improve land quality and in turn ensure a good harvest. However, in the [CLIENT PROJECT] treatment areas, evidence suggests that not many land or soil conservation activities have been undertaken. Percentage of respondents taking up soil or land conservation activities have been depicted in the graphs below: 23 --- Page 25 --- Figure No. 15: Soil Conservation measures undertaken (Treatment; N = 178) Figure No. 16: Land Conservation measures undertaken (Treatment; N = 178) It can be clearly noticed from the above graphs that farm bunding followed by land levelling seems to be the preferred land/ soil conservation measures that the villagers currently employ. The median total land treated for such practices (by about 75% respondents of 178) is 40.00 guntha while no area of barren land is being treated. 24 --- Page 26 --- b) Water and irrigation status Given that the region is home to a vast number of small and marginal farmers who practice subsistence agriculture, it is hardly surprising to note that the ﬁelds of 70.22% of the respondents are fully rainfed. The farm irrigation status of the entire sample is as represented below: Figure No. 17: Respondents farm irrigation status (Treatment; N = 178) The majority, 70.20%, practice rainfed agriculture. 96.64% of the total 178 respondents practicing agriculture claimed that they would want to irrigate their ﬁelds instead of depending on the rains, however only 46.24% of those who require the facility are able to access sources for the same. The median cultivable area for the respondents depending on their irrigation status is shown in the table below : Irrigation status N Median cultivated area (gunthas) Fully rainfed 125 80 Partially irrigated (less than 50%) 36 87 Partially irrigated (more than 50%) 16 94.5 Fully irrigated 1 90 Table No. 6: Median cultivated area according to irrigation status On an average, currently people use existing irrigation facilities for about 4 months but their requirement is for a period of 6 months. 40 gunthas is the median irrigated area for those who make 25 --- Page 27 --- use of irrigation facilities. The month-wise irrigation requirements of the community are mapped in the graph below: Figure No. 18: Respondents month-wise irrigation requirement (Treatment; N = 80) From the above graph, it can be seen that the requirement for irrigation is higher for months other than the kharif season. Despite the region getting high monsoon rainfall (1986 mm in 2018 4 ), only 29.77% of respondents practicing agriculture reported being able to irrigate their ﬁelds. The median area of irrigated land is found to be 46.73 gunthas while the median cultivated area for respondents irrigating their ﬁelds is 120.30 gunthas. This means that for a typical farmer, about 38.84% of his cultivable land is irrigated. Rivers and borewells form the primary source of irrigation for 50.94% and 32.08% respectively of the 53 respondents having irrigation facilities. Challenges to irrigation could be attributed to the lack of functional water harvesting structures in the region which is already characterized by a hot and dry summer. The dearth of effective water conservation structures as voiced by the respondents utilizing irrigation facilities has been shown in the graph below : 4 https://dag.gujarat.gov.in/images/directorofagriculture/pdf/APY-2016-17-2017-18-2018-19-for-website.pdf 26 --- Page 28 --- Figure No. 19: Respondents water conservation structures usage (Treatment; N = 53) Also, those irrigating their ﬁelds (N = 53) preferably make use of a diesel pump (75.47%) or an electric pump (28.30%) for lifting water and pipes for distributing it (98.11%). No evidence for usage of advanced systems for lifting water like solar pumps or distributing water like drip or sprinkler irrigation systems has been found in the village during the course of the baseline. The existence and functionality of water user groups in the project area cannot be established with a consensus given that only 2.79% of all respondents said that they were part of such a group. c) Crops grown Kharif season 100% farmers practicing agriculture (i.e. 178 people) reported that they cultivated their land in the last kharif season. This fact is quite apparent given that the majority farmers are smallholders who practice rainfed agriculture. In the last kharif season (June 2020 - October 2020), a vast majority (98.31%) grew paddy followed by pulses like Tuvar (82.58%) and Urad (81.82%). Some farmers grew Tindora (25.28%) and Ragi (35.39%). Given that the farmers in the area own sufﬁcient land, only 4.49% of them reported taking a single crop - paddy, while the other 95.50% of them were multi-croppers (i.e. they cultivated more than 1 crop). On an average, farmers cultivate paddy on 40.00 gunthas (median) of land and tuvar and urad dal on 10.00 gunthas (median) of land each. A summary of medians of the main crops grown in kharif is as given below: Crops Respondents growing the crop Area cultivated (guntha) Total harvest per household Yield (Kg/ guntha) Retained for home consumpt ion (Kg) Respondents selling the crop (%) Quantity sold (Kg) Per unit price (Rs) Revenue (Rs) 27 --- Page 29 --- (%) (Kg) Paddy 98.31% 40.00 700.00 17.50 600.00 14.86% 0.00 14.00 0.00 Tuvar dal 89.89% 10.00 10.00 1.00 10.00 0.64% 0.00 60.00 0.00 Urad dal 87.64% 10.00 10.00 1.00 10.00 0.00% 0.00 60.00 0.00 Ragi 35.39% 10.00 40.00 4.00 40.00 1.59% 0.00 30.00 0.00 Tindora 25.28% 10.00 1320.00 132.00 0.00 86.67% 1200.00 20.00 24000.00 Table No. 7: Summary of crops grown in Kharif, N = 178 From the above table, it can be observed that the median total paddy yield is 700.00 Kg with about 600.00 Kg being retained for household consumption. The 17.5 Kg/guntha yield reported in the baseline is a little lesser than the cluster yield mentioned in the DPR (2018) prepared by the client - 21.68 Kg/guntha. Although the median is 0, on average, about 154.69 Kg of the harvest is sold at a per unit price of Rs. 13.01 generating about Rs. 2012.52 as income. Approximately, half of the median cultivable land is cultivated with paddy thereby leaving little space for seeds of other crops to be sown in the kharif season. Quite predictably, Urad and Tuvar dal are sown on lesser land area, and generate a yield of 10.00 Kg and 5.00 Kg respectively. Both these crops are also grown for self-consumption with no quantity being sold in the market. 86.67% of those growing Tindora sell this high yielding crop, thereby generating good revenue for themselves. Secondary research suggests that the average yield of Tindora is 14 tonnes per hectare (141.64 Kg/guntha). The baseline survey indicates that tindora yield is 132 Kg/guntha in the project area which is almost equivalent to the normal yield of the crop in India. The village-wise total production (in Kg) of the main crops grown in the kharif season is as shown in the table below: Crops Avdha Bopi Hanmatmal Total Paddy 27,450.00 96,180.00 50,540.00 181,870.00 Urad dal 465.00 1,251.00 1,005.00 2,733.00 Tuvar dal 451.00 1,875.00 669.00 3,010.00 Ragi (Nagli) 992.00 2,218.00 1,748.00 4,958.00 Tindora 93,175.00 5,770.00 11,600.00 110,545.00 Table No. 8: Total production of kharif crops grown in the treatment villages (Kg) Maximum respondents make use of chemical or organic fertilizers only while cultivating paddy or tindora and no other crop. Not surprisingly, the median cost incurred on cultivating paddy and Tindora is found to be Rs. 8000 each while the median cost of cultivation for all other crops is found to be 0. 28 --- Page 30 --- Rabi season Only 38.20% of all farmers (i.e. 68 farmers) said that they cultivated their land in the last rabi season (October 2020 to February 2021). The total area cultivated in the rabi season collectively is 1,703.00 gunthas. This is highly correlated with the fact that irrigation requirements are higher in these months and employment in agriculture decreases signiﬁcantly. Gram, Tindora, Oilseeds, Brinjal and Bajari are the main crops grown by farmers who farm their land in the rabi season. Of the 38.20% farmers, about 61.76% farmers grew a single crop while the others (38.23%) grew more than one crop. A summary of medians of the crops grown in rabi is given in the table below: Crops Respond ents growing the crop (%) Area cultivate d (guntha) Total harvest (Kg) Yield (Kg/ guntha) Retained for home consump tion (Kg) Responde nts selling the crop (%) Quantity sold (Kg) Per unit price (Rs) Revenue (Rs) Gram 50.00% 16.50 21.00 1.27 20.00 2.94% 0.00 45.00 0.00 Tindora 14.71% 10.00 1000.00 100.00 0.00 100.00% 1000.00 20.00 20,000.00 Brinjal 14.71% 3.50 250.00 71.43 0.00 40.00% 117.50 17.50 2,056.25 Sunhemp 11.76% 17.50 25.00 1.43 0.00 50.00% 2.50 47.50 118.75 Table No. 9: Summary of crops grown in Rabi, N = 68 From the above table, it can be inferred that owing to unavailability of the required quantities of water, the number of respondents who farm and the area of land cultivated is seen to reduce considerably. Of the 38.20% cultivating in the rabi season, 50.00% grow rabi while 14.71% grow Tindora and brinjal each and few (11.76%) grow sunhemp. Tindora, Brinjal and some Sunhemp is sold in the market generating some revenue for the household. On an average, Rs. 500.00 is spent on inputs required for gram cultivation while Rs. 7000.00 and Rs. 2250.00 is spent on tindora and brinjal cultivation respectively. The village-wise total production (in Kg) of the main crops grown in the rabi season is as shown in the table below: Crops Avdha Bopi Hanmatmal Total Gram (Chana) 879.00 420.00 450.00 1,771.00 Sunhemp 70.00 225.00 0.00 295.00 Brinjal 2,100.00 1,000.00 1,955.00 5,055.00 Karela 500.00 0.00 8,500.00 9,000.00 Tindora 6,800.00 0.00 5,000.00 11,800.00 Table No. 10: Total production of rabi crops grown in the treatment villages (Kg) 29 --- Page 31 --- Agricultural Operations The mechanization of agriculture in the treatment area can be evidenced from the usage of different equipments by the respondents as shown below: Figure No. 20: Equipments used for cultivation, N = 178 It can be observed that majority respondents use a tractor and a plough/ tiller for turning the soil before sowing. Also, 53.37% of the sample population expressed the need for a storage facility for their harvest with only 2.25% of this lot claiming that they have access to and make use of one such facility already. Only 37.08% of the sampled people claimed that they currently undertake some kind of value addition activities on the produce post harvesting. Of this lot, 92.42% respondents mention sorting/ grading followed by milling (57.58%) as the main value addition activities that they undertake. The preference for usage of marketing channels has been mapped in the graph shown below: 30 --- Page 32 --- Figure No. 21: Marketing channels used by respondents (Treatment, N = 178) Selling produce to local traders is the preferred marketing channel for most of the respondents (52.81%). Few sell their produce via APMC mandis (14.61%) or in local markets (4.49%). Also, given that a majority in the region are subsistence farmers, a signiﬁcant number (38.20%) do not sell their produce at all. 37.08% of 179 villagers claimed that they presently avail beneﬁt from government schemes. 77.27% of those beneﬁting from government schemes reported the scheme to be PM KISAN. Challenges faced 90.45% of the 178 respondents mentioned lack of availability of water as the main problem that they face while practicing agriculture. 64.61% respondents talked about soil erosion while 61.80% mentioned crop damage caused by insects as their main challenges to farming. These challenges are graphically depicted in the chart shown below: 31 --- Page 33 --- Figure No. 22: Challenges faced by respondents in Agriculture (Treatment; N = 178) Also, 73.03% of 178 respondents reported that their agrarian livelihood was susceptible to certain climate risks. 62.31% of the sampled people reported excessive and unseasonal rains followed by storms (44.62%) as the major climate risks that they faced. People tell of having faced at most 1 such incident in the last 2 years. The loss incurred in times like these is estimated by them to be approximately Rs. 5000.00. d) Livelihoods available The baseline study also took stock of the kinds of livelihood opportunities available to the farmer in the region. 93.30% respondents spoke of subsistence farming during monsoon as the main livelihood avenue available in the treatment areas currently. About 33.52% and 32.96 people respectively told of rabi cropping/ vegetable cultivation and livestock development as the livelihood activities they are engaged in presently. Only 4.47% of the respondents spoke of establishing micro-enterprises like small-scale mills, nurseries etc as an alternative livelihood opportunity that they could take up. The livelihoods available to an average farmer in the project area are mapped in the graph shown below: 32 --- Page 34 --- Figure No. 23: Livelihoods available to respondents currently (Treatment; N = 179) e) Migration patterns 35.75% of the sample population (i.e. 64 of 179) said that they themselves or their family members migrate outside the village for work. Of these, 90.14% are male while 9.86% are female. In any given month, the average number of days for which the respondent migrates is 22. The total number of people migrating in each month of the year is plotted in the graph below: 33 --- Page 35 --- Figure No. 24: Respondents migration pattern (Treatment; N = 64) The above graph shows that out of 64 people migrating, most people (64.79%) generally choose to migrate from the months of November to May. This is in alignment with the fact that people cultivate their lands from the months of June to October (Kharif season). Migration starts as soon as challenges to irrigate begin to crop up in the rabi season. No work in the village has been mentioned as the primary reason for migration. Better employment opportunities outside and irrigation challenges were the other reasons for migration. The FGDs conducted in the villages of Avdha, Bopi and Hanumatmal helped us get the following inferences on the migration practices of the region. According to them, migration starts after Diwali (after October month) and people come back when rain comes. They work mostly in industrial units of Vapi and Valsad, Dharampur, doing agriculture activities, pest spray, masonry, construction activity, wood cutting, and daily wage labor. They return in between at the interval of 15 days. During Kharif season, June to October they pursue agriculture and do not migrate in those days. If there are more than two adult male members in a family then one adult male member of the family is highly likely to migrate. Around 10% families migrate with partners, while in the remaining 90% of families only male members could migrate. 6. [CLIENT PROJECT] Status of Agroforestry in the region prior to [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] intervention At the baseline, about 65.92% (i.e. 118 of 179 respondents) reported that they currently have their own fruit/ agroforestry trees. These plantations can best be considered to be rudimentary and 34 --- Page 36 --- should not be confused with the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention which comes with its own technical know-how and package of practices as a part of its model. Figure No. 25: Respondents current agroforestry status Majority respondents (94.07%) report having mango trees in their orchards presently while some have teak (25.42%), cashew (18.64%), bamboo (20.34%) and acacia (10.17%). The median number of trees that a usual respondent has in their orchard is : mango - 15, cashew - 20, teak - 50, bamboo - 23 and acacia - 55. The number of trees grown versus the number of respondents from the treatment villages is mapped in the table below: Acacia Bamboo Cashew Mango Teak N Tree number N Tree number N Tree number N Tree number N Tree number 1 12 9 1 to 10 4 1 to 10 41 1 to 10 2 1 to 10 1 20 2 11 to 20 14 11 to 20 12 11 to 20 4 11 to 20 3 30 10 21 to 30 1 30 19 21 to 30 2 21 to 30 1 50 3 50 3 50 4 31 to 40 1 40 1 60 22 7 41 to 50 9 50 3 100 1 60 2 70 2 125 2 100 1 90 5 100 35 --- Page 37 --- 1 120 1 130 1 200 12 (total) 24 (total) 44 (total) 86 (total) 29 (total) Table No. 11: Summary of trees grown in the treatment villages prior to the [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention 86.49% of those growing mango trees report that their trees have survived for more than 7 years. Similarly, more than 90.00% respondents report that their other trees have survived for more than 7 years. People report spending 10 days per month currently tending to their fruit trees. Of those presently having agroforestry plantations, 53.39% report that they sell the produce while 46.61% assert that they retain the produce for household consumption. Those who sell report earning Rs. 6000.00 from the sale of the produce. Only 7.26% of the respondents told of availing beneﬁts from government schemes on seeds and fertilizers for their [CLIENT PROJECT]. Under the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention introduced by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION], at the time of the baseline survey, 73.74% of the 179 sampled people reported that they are a part of a [CLIENT PROJECT] tukdi. Also, 100% report having received the saplings from [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] for the [CLIENT PROJECT] project. 25.14% of respondents claimed that they had undergone at least 1 training for [CLIENT PROJECT]. 68.18% of the [CLIENT PROJECT] tukdi members claimed that the group met regularly and reported planning for the upcoming [CLIENT PROJECT] project (73.48%) followed by development of land and water resource conservation structures for [CLIENT PROJECT] (46.97%) as the issues that they discussed. Villagers depend on wood from agroforestry trees for meeting their household requirements. Looking at the median, it can be inferred that people residing in the treatment villages spend about 1 day per month cutting wood. The time spent on cutting wood is higher in Avdha and Hanmatmal but lower in village Bopi. They report spending 2 hours per day on this activity. However, data suggests that about 60%-70% families have LPG cylinders as well. But the cost of reﬁlling them is about Rs.950 - which is costly and so most families do depend on wood to supplement their cooking fuel requirements. Inputs from traders A vegetable Trader, Mr. Chandubhai Tuljibhai Raut from Hanmatmal village was interviewed to get his insights on vegetable trading in the block and the district. Chandubhai procures and sells vegetables in and around Valsad district. He sells vegetables and mangoes as per the peak production months, market demand and price margin. He has two pick up vans which travel up to a radius of 18 Kms per day for the procurement. He tells during the Kharif season, June to October, production of vegetables per farmer ranges between 5-7 Kgs per harvest. With this small quantity and higher petrol price, the transportation becomes costlier in turn leading to lesser proﬁts, so farmers don’t go to sell in APMC. This is an opportunity for traders so the trader collects vegetables from the farmer&amp;#x27;s home. Even with less 36 --- Page 38 --- quantity, he sells them to local markets in Vansda and Dharampur, and if he identiﬁes higher demands or better price valuation, he sells them to the markets in Surat, Vadodara, and Ahmedabad. Traders collect Bitter gourd and Little gourd (Karela and Tindora) from nearby villages such as Ganva, Ambrsi, Bahutan, and Mamabhacha. These villages are within 5-7 kms away from the Hanumatmal village. He roams around 60 Kms per day to collect vegetables from the farmers and sell them in Vansda or Gangpur APMC. A few farmers in Karjanpada village sell Sponge gourd (Galka) directly in Dharampur APMC. Chandubhai says traders pay to the farmers as per weight of the vegetables collected, quality of vegetables and vegetables sorted and graded according to their size. Price valuation, quality examination, sorting and grading are done at the farmer&amp;#x27;s home itself and the rejected vegetables are returned to the farmer post procurement. He further adds, “We have two pickup vans for transportation. My vans pick up on a daily basis 700-900 kg vegetables and sell them in Vansda APMC. We operate on low proﬁt margins, procure Bitter gourd at Rs.15/kg from the farmers and sell it at Rs.16-17/kg to APMC. The cost of transportation remains around Rs.2/Kg. When the season of Okra, Cluster beans and Brinjal ends, we start collecting mangoes from the farmers. Driver’s monthly salary is Rs.9,000 , paying Rs. 300 per day to helper staff to load and unload vegetables and per day expense of diesel is around Rs.1000. Overall the proﬁt margin is based on the trading points of sale, as in to APMCs or to the bigger markets in Ahmedabad, Surat and Valsad”. He explains mango price valuation by telling that when there is a low price for mangoes in the market, farmers hold the produce and wait for the price to increase or demand high price from the traders. On the other side, traders are aware about the price of mango in the APMC and do not pay higher prices to farmers for the mango. Traders have a higher bargaining power in this case so they offer only lower prices, which are at par with the APMC prices. This affects the farmers a lot but a little to the traders as they obtain a decent proﬁt margin. For storage, he says the nearest facility available is in Khanpur village, 18 Kms away from Hanumatmal village. Mangoes can be stored in cold storage for 8-10 days but vegetables like Karela, Tindora and Galka can’t be stored for more than 3-4 days. Farmers usually cannot bear the storage expenses; they make a proﬁt by selling a lesser quantity of vegetables, however, it becomes a gamble for a trader at times to store and expect better prices in the future. Pertaining to trade, Chandubhai informs - due to the Kharif season, between June to October, ﬂowering of vegetables doesn&amp;#x27;t happen well and results in low production of vegetables. Accordingly, before November, we sell vegetables in Dharampur APMC or Vansda APMC. During and after (Bhindi season) November month, we sell some of the vegetables in Ahmedabad, in bigger trucks or Eicher. On an average, we send 5 tons of vegetables/day in Ahmedabad city. We collect and sell Brinjal, Cluster beans and Flat beans (Baingan, Guvar and Valod) to Ahmedabad. In Rabi season too, we trade vegetables to Jamalpur APMC - Ahmedabad by external transport. When the season of Okra, Cluster beans and Brinjal ends, we start collecting mangoes from the farmers. Farmers of Bhavnagar, Amreli and Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, usually have good production of the Kesar variety of mango which they sell in Valsad. Before the COVID lockdown, an export agent was collecting Sponge gourd, Little gourd, Bitter gourd (Galka, Tindora, Karela) and Mango from the local vegetable traders. 37 --- Page 39 --- When asked about future expectations from APMC and farmers groups, he mentions that traders haven’t received any beneﬁt or subsidy from APMC/ government. He says in the upcoming two-three years, farmers would increase the sowing area of creeper vegetables as more traders are directly collecting the vegetables from their homes. An APMC can be developed in Hanumatmal. If there is a farmer’s group (or [Client Project] tukdi) then it can be helpful in collecting and selling vegetables from the village. The group can store mangoes for 15 days and sell the mangoes, when they get a higher price. 7. Community Institutions 99.44% respondents told of not being a member of any FPO or cooperative even though 18.99% respondents claimed that they knew of the existence of a FPO/ FIG/ cooperative in their village/ block. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence to prove that a functioning FPO exists in the village. In such a scenario, the [CLIENT PROJECT] project proposes a good model for business by organising the farmers into [CLIENT PROJECT] tukdis ﬁrstly, which will then merge to form village development committees (VDCs) at the village level which eventually will be linked to the FPOs like Pindval Cooperative and VAPCOL for backward/ forward linkages and marketing of produce respectively. Given the pivotal role of community institutions like FPOs in making the [CLIENT PROJECT] project sustainable, the following recommendations could be useful from the perspective of strengthening community institutions: a) Firstly, the process of institutionalization needs to begin from the time the [CLIENT PROJECT] project starts (and not after some years when the [CLIENT PROJECT] trees start fruiting). This is so as to ensure that the community understands why an FPO is needed, how the model works and what’s in it for them. The FPO can start with dealing in input supply to get started. b) Secondly, the FPO formed should not deal exclusively in horticultural produce from [CLIENT PROJECT] farmers, but should trade in other crops and include non-[CLIENT PROJECT] farmers as well. Diversiﬁcation of produce traded and income sources hedges the FPO against risks associated with particular commodities and increased farmer membership base ensures that the FPO caters to all people of the region. 8. Women’s Participation 17.88% of the total respondents in the sample were women (i.e. 32) and all of them were actively involved in farming activities like land preparation, sowing and harvesting. However, only 43.75% of these 32 women claimed that they were involved in marketing and selling of produce. Fewer still (25.00%) reported that they migrate for labor work. Also, 25.00%, 9.38% and 12.50% of the women reported that they attended capacity building sessions on [CLIENT PROJECT], went on exposure visits for the same and attended mixed gender meetings respectively. Their contribution to decision making is mapped in the graph shown below: 38 --- Page 40 --- Figure No. 26: Women’s participation in decision making (Treatment, N = 32) From the above graph, it can be seen that while most women claim to be empowered enough to contribute in decision making, it is not the case for every one. Inputs were gathered on different aspects of women’s livelihood from the 2 focus group discussions conducted, which are as elaborated below: a) Ownership and awareness of assets: Around 40% of the 32 women legally own the land as a part of inheritance and are aware of the land. The challenge was that they are not aware of the dimensions to report. b) Decisions in farming activities: In both the FGDs, the farming decisions are followed as traditional practices to grow, labour and sale. It seems they are consensual decisions and rarely get into conﬂicts. Women said their family members understand the value in their judgement and make decisions towards a better outcome. Mostly men go to Dharampur or Valsad as a combined group in Jeep to sell their produce, be it mangoes or vegetables. Due to water shortage, only a few families (3 to 4) grow vegetables and majority of the women are rearing livestock. c) Decisions on education: The education levels of women who participated in the FGDs ranged from being illiterate to studying till 12th standard. They send their children to school till 12th std in a vicinity of 6-8 kms and women actively voice their opinions for children’s education and family members support the children’s education. d) Decisions on health : Subcenter is one kilometer away from BOPI village and Primary Health Center is in Dharampur 22 Kms away. In the s ub center, they can get medicine for the illnesses of small children such as fever, seasonal ﬂu and common cold. They take active decisions on children’s health and family members’ health with the inﬂuence of Aangan[Client Project] and ASHA workers. 39 --- Page 41 --- They are actively engaged by frontline healthcare workers to be aware about sexual and reproductive hygiene, menstrual health and using sanitary pads. Family members support them to make independent decisions on healthcare, such as women buying sanitary pads from shops or addressing taboos around it. e) Women’s Transportation : Women and girls commute on their own by bu s if a private vehicle is not available in the family. 9. Summary of Village-wise key ﬁndings for treatment A summary of some important indicators for the 3 treatment villages is shown in the table below: Parameter Avdha Bopi Hanmatmal N Value N Value N Value Total annual agricultural income (median) 39 Rs. 31,000.00 42 Rs. 9,900.00 30 Rs. 20,000.00 Agricultural income per acre of cultivated land (median) 39 Rs. 15,094.34 41 Rs. 3,809.52 30 Rs. 6,729.41 Avg. total land holding (median) 45 80.00 guntha 89 115.00 guntha 43 110.00 guntha Avg. irrigated land (median) 25 20.00 guntha 10 50.00 guntha 18 40.00 guntha Total area cultivated (Kharif) 45 3,288.00 guntha 89 8,384.00 guntha 44 3,570.00 guntha Total area cultivated (Rabi) 45 373.00 guntha 89 652.00 guntha 44 669.00 guntha % of BPL respondents 45 75.56% 89 47.19% 44 54.55% % of respondents illiterate 45 62.22% 89 64.04% 44 38.64% % of respondents having electricity connection 45 100.00% 89 100.00% 44 100.00% % of respondents having LPG stove 45 51.11% 89 69.66% 44 63.64% % of respondents having agricultural land 45 100.00% 89 98.88% 44 97.73% % of respondents having smartphone 45 71.11% 89 62.92% 44 50.00% % of respondents having agroforestry plantation previously (before BAIF intervention) 45 80.00% 89 56.18% 44 72.73% % of respondents migrating 45 37.78% 89 32.58% 44 40.91% Total average male migration 17 60.00 25 150.00 15 82.00 40 --- Page 42 --- days per year (median) Days spent cutting wood per month (median) 45 3.00 89 0.00 44 1.00 Total annual income (median) 45 Rs. 80,000.00 89 Rs. 82,500.00 44 Rs. 91,000.00 Table No. 12: Village-wise Summary of key ﬁndings The annual contribution of different sources to the annual income of the 3 villages is as shown below: Contribution to income from different sources Avdha Bopi Hanmatmal N Median (Rs) N Median (Rs) N Median (Rs) Self employed 5 12,000.00 17 50,000.00 4 48,500.00 Farming 39 31,000.00 42 9,900.00 30 20,000.00 Farm based activities (goatry, milk farming, livestock rearing etc.) 5 24,000.00 38 48,500.00 13 70,000.00 Agricultural labour 19 24,000.00 45 15,000.00 22 30,500.00 Daily wage labour 13 65,000.00 31 35,000.00 13 40,000.00 Salaried work 9 84,000.00 12 90,000.00 10 73,500.00 Remittance 0 . 2 37,500.00 1 170,000.00 Migrant labourer 14 20,000.00 27 36,000.00 15 30,000.00 Government subsidies 3 12,000.00 11 6,000.00 3 6,000.00 Others 0 . 2 3,000.00 1 200,000.00 Total annual income 45 80,000.00 89 82,500.00 44 91,000.00 Table No. 13: Contribution to income from different sources (village-wise) It can be seen from the above graph that while the median annual income earned from farming per se is low, it is other activities - like working as a daily wage labour or migration that sufﬁciently adds to the annual income of the family. Given this scenario, the [CLIENT PROJECT] intervention has the capacity to signiﬁcantly increase the households income from farming. 10. Treatment and Comparison group analysis For impact evaluation of the [CLIENT PROJECT] project at the endline, along with a treatment group of 179 people, a comparison group of 132 individuals from similar villages is chosen. A comparative analysis of the treatment and control groups on few basic characteristics is shown in the table below: Parameter Treatment Comparison Agricultural income per acre of cultivated land (median) Rs 6,612.02 Rs 6,241.14 41 --- Page 43 --- Avg. land holding (median) 100.00 guntha 62.50 guntha Avg. irrigated land (median) 40.00 guntha 40.00 guntha Total area cultivated (Kharif) 15,337.00 guntha 9,314.00 guntha Total area cultivated (Rabi) 1,703.00 guntha 887.00 guntha % of BPL respondents 56.42% 68.94% % of illiterate respondents 56.98% 54.55% % of respondents having electricity connection 100.00% 96.97% % of respondents having LPG stove 63.69% 74.24% % of respondents having agricultural land 98.88% 99.24% % of respondents having smartphone 62.01% 53.03% % of respondents having agroforestry plantation previously (before BAIF intervention) 65.92 % 65.91 % % of respondents migrating 35.75% 51.52% Total average male migration days per year (median) 87.00 165.00 Table No. 14: Comparative analysis of treatment and control From the above table, it can be inferred that the average land holding and income per acre of the treatment group is higher than the comparison group. The average irrigated land holding for the treatment group is also higher than the comparison group, which is in alignment with the fact that the migration rate is lower for the treatment group. Ownership of assets like electricity and farming land is similar between the two groups while LPG stove connections are higher in the comparison group but smartphone penetration lower (as compared to the treatment group). The presence of Agroforestry (prior to [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] intervention) is also equivalent between the two groups. Also, overall, there are more number of people below the poverty line for the comparison group than the treatment group. Different methods like Difference-in-Differences (DID), Propensity Score Matching (PSM) or Instrumental Variables (IV) can be used for evaluating the [CLIENT PROJECT] project&amp;#x27;s impact based on the similarity of characteristics between the two groups of people. Based on the qualitative and quantitative evidence collected at the baseline, DID is ruled out (since parallel trends assumption is not met) while other methods like PSM or IV can be used for impact evaluation. 11. Limitations Some limitations that hindered the effective execution of the baseline study of the [CLIENT PROJECT] project are as follows : a) The t-test conducted for checking the similarity of characteristics between the treatment and comparison groups indicates that there are signiﬁcant differences between the two groups. Also, qualitative inputs received from [CLIENT ORGANIZATION] - that the people in comparison villages have lesser privately owned land and are under the inﬂuence of the 42 --- Page 44 --- Satipati cult - provide further clues that substantiate the fact that the two groups are not comparable. A limitation posed by this fact is that given that the two groups are dissimilar, impact evaluation of the project at the endline using the Difference-in-Differences methodology will not be possible since these groups do not satisfy the parallel trends assumption. In this case, other methods like IV or PSM will need to be employed for impact evaluation with the data collected at the baseline for the comparison group being rendered useless. b) The women&amp;#x27;s representation in the treatment group sampled stands at 17.88% in the baseline in contrast to the 25% mentioned in the inception report. This is because even though 25% women were surveyed overall (for both the treatment and comparison group taken together); of these 25%, 61.90% were from the comparison group while 38.10% women were from the treatment group. However, we have tried to overcome this limitation by effectively capturing women’s voices and opinions through qualitative methods like focussed group discussions. c) Secondary data for reference has been taken from multiple sources like the project proposal, MoU and other such documents shared by [CLIENT ORGANIZATION]. The statistics from these sources were used for comparison with the baseline ﬁndings. Overall, according to the [CLIENT PROJECT] index developed 5 , the treatment group seems to be better-off than the comparison group while the district seems to have progressed way better than the entire sample surveyed. Since the latest DPR for the [CLIENT PROJECT] project was not available for reference, the baseline ﬁndings of the treatment and control villages have been compared with the indicators of the district. Thus, it cannot be conclusively established if the region is doing better or worse than itself over time. Readers need to exercise caution and be mindful of this limitation while drawing inferences from this report. Also, the parallel trends assumption which needs to hold if DID is to be used for evaluating impact can be effectively validated only if the latest secondary data is available. Given that the latest data is not available, it becomes difﬁcult to test the baseline data for this assumption thus this becomes a severe limitation. d) Some bias in the data could be introduced because of the inherent lack of knowledge among women about information related to landholding, income and expenses (household, agricultural and others). Women needed considerable help from their male counterparts while answering questions requiring numeric responses. In such a scenario, while initially we let the men help the women and told them to step aside when questions related to women empowerment were asked; later we let the women respond to the entire survey without any interference from men and captured their responses as they were. 5 [CLIENT PROJECT] index calculation results are attached in the appendix. 43 --- Page 45 --- 12.

This 47 --- Page 49 --- allows us to correct for any differences between the treatment and comparison groups that are constant over time. Instead of comparing outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups after the intervention, the difference-in-differences method compares trends between the treatment and comparison groups. This method takes the before-after difference in the treatment group’s outcomes. This is the ﬁrst difference. In comparing the same group to itself, the ﬁrst difference controls for factors that are constant over time in that group. Then, to capture time-varying factors, difference-in-differences takes the before-after difference in the control group, which was exposed to the same set of environmental conditions as the treatment group. This is the second difference. Finally, difference-in-differences “cleans” all time-varying factors from the ﬁrst difference by subtracting the second difference from it. This leaves us with the impact estimation – or the difference-in-differences. The Parallel trends assumption For obtaining an unbiased DID estimate, it is imperative to test for the parallel or equal trends assumption. This means without treatment, outcomes would need to increase or decrease at the same rate in both the groups. In other words, the parallel trends assumption states that, although treatment and comparison groups may have different levels of the outcome prior to the start of treatment, their trends in pre-treatment outcomes should be the same. If outcome trends are different for the treatment and comparison groups, then the estimated treatment effect obtained by difference-in-differences method would be invalid, or biased. That’s because the trend for the comparison group is not a valid estimate of the counterfactual trend that would have prevailed for the treatment group in the absence of the program. If in reality outcomes for the comparison group grow more slowly than outcomes for the treatment group in the absence of the program, using the trend for the comparison group as an estimate of the counterfactual of the trend for the treatment group leads to a biased estimate of the program’s impact; more speciﬁcally, we would overestimate the impact of the program. Note on Propensity Score Matching Propensity Score Matching is an impact evaluation technique that essentially uses statistical methods to construct an artiﬁcial comparison group. For every possible unit under treatment, it attempts to ﬁnd a nontreatment unit (or set of nontreatment units) that has the most similar characteristics possible. Matching methods enable you to identify the set of non-enrolled individuals that look most similar to the treated individuals, based on the characteristics that are available in your data set. These matched non-enrolled individuals then become the comparison group that can be used to estimate the counterfactual. Finding a good match for each program participant requires approximating as closely as possible the characteristics that explain that individual decision to enroll in the program. In PSM, for each unit in the treatment group and in the pool of non-enrolled, we compute the probability that this unit will enroll in the program (the so-called propensity score) based on the observed values of its characteristics (the explanatory variables). This score is a real number between 0 and 1 that summarizes the inﬂuence of all of the observed characteristics on the 48 --- Page 50 --- likelihood of enrolling in the program. Once the propensity score has been computed for all units, then units in the treatment group can be matched with units in the pool of non-enrolled that have the closest propensity score. These closest units become the comparison group and are used to produce an estimate of the counterfactual. The propensity score–matching method tries to mimic the randomized assignment to treatment and comparison groups by choosing for the comparison group those units that have similar propensities to the units in the treatment group. The average difference in outcomes between the treatment or enrolled units and their matched comparison units produces the estimated impact of the program. In summary, the program’s impact is estimated by comparing the average outcomes of a treatment or enrolled group and the average outcomes among a statistically matched subgroup of units, the match being based on observed characteristics available in the data at hand.

It is a part of Catalyst Group, a leading development support group in India. CMS has more than 24 years of experience of supporting development organizations in India and South/Southe ast Asia and Africa. It works with the vision of improving the quality of life of disadvantaged groups through strengthening effectiveness of development policies, processes and outcomes. Towards this, CMS supports various development partners in: 1. Designing for impact - We use established design and planning frameworks, like Results Based Management (RBM), Logical Framework Approach among others for helping design theory of change, strategic plan, operational implementation plan, business plan among others 2. Research and evaluate for change - We partner with for -impact organisations and donors to design and execute use -focused evaluations and research using rigorous and fit -for- purpose methodologies. 3. Monitor for results - We believe in use -focused moni toring systems which help in moving up the evidence -to-results chain, with our proprietary approach PALP (Planning, Accountability, Learning, Performance Management), which helps partners feed monitoring into: a. Planning (and redesigning, including strategy analysis) b. Accountability (to communities, staff and donors) c. Learning (from successes, failures and the big grey middle) d. Performance Management [to understand trajectories, predict the future (not just tell the past), and diagnose) CMS has grown manifold a nd has handled more than 1100 assignments in various domains with 200+ organizations across 29 countries. CMS are specialists in the development sector and have worked across multiple themes including worker wellbeing in factory settings, WaSH, health, supply chain interventions among others. Our experience CMS along with its sister organization, Swasti has worked extensively with factories across the world. The work includes training of the workers on health and wellbeing including WaSH. Through these programmes, we have directly reached close to 200,000 workers, and about 500,000 people through our community interventions across 11 countries and about 14 states in India. The partners include Gap Inc. (P.A.C.E. - Personal Advancement and Career Enhance ment), Walmart Foundation (Women in Factories), BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) for HERfinance, HERhealth, HERrespect programs, Debenhams, Zlabels (LIFE), Page Industries (Life Skill Initiative), Primark (My Life), Levi’s and other brands for Work er Wellbeing initiatives. --- Page 4 --- 4 Some of the recent experiences of CMS in similar studies has been summarized below: 1. Establishing and running the monitoring and evaluation systems which includes measuring ROI and SROI at regular intervals in factories implementin g comprehensive health programme called Invest For Wellness (i4We) 2. Measuring ROI in factories implementing the HerHealth programme in India 3. Scoping study for programme with Inditex 4.

Monitoring and evaluation of BMGF funded Avahan Indi a AIDS Initiative across five states in India for 3.5 years 8. Assessments in over 100 healthcare facilities in 3 states of the country in partnership with WaterAid to monitor the Water, Sanitation and hygiene conditions 9. Evaluation of WaSH interventions in ur ban slums in India 10. GAIN Unilever Project: Evaluation of the Nutrition Program with Tea farmers, farm workers and estate workers in Tamil Nadu, India focussed on improving the dietary diversity and handwashing habits of the tea farming families 11. Consultation Service to Develop Training Manual with Modules for the Capacity Building of Village Water and Sanitation Committees under NRDWP 12. Process documentation of Atmashakti&amp;#x27;s approach to achieving sanitation in rural Odisha 13. Evaluation of Arghyam’s interventions i n WaSH in India Hence, we bring together thematic experience of working in factories and in health and WaSH and the technical expertise of monitoring and evaluation, research, data collection and conducting ROI and SROI studies in different settings. Our approach CMS will bring together a team with experience of working with factories, of designing monitoring and evaluation systems, implementing it, designing research and collecting data and of designing and implementing ROI studies in different settings. We understand that an approach for ROI and evaluation has been finalized already and the finalized team nee ds to implement the approach and monitor it regularly to measure and report the progress. As detailed in the RFP, CMS will depute a consultant from the team who will be based out of Lucknow and will support through inhouse support for atleast 1 day in th e week. In addition to this, we also will bring experts who will provide technical and managerial support to the consultant for designing tools and implementing them for monitoring of the programme, measuring ROI and writing reports and case studies which can be used for larger dissemination. --- Page 5 --- 5 The image below summarizes the approach which CMS would like to adopt for supporting WaterAID and the factories for this assignment. As explained in the framework, the following are the key processes that will be undertaken to ensure that the deliverables are met with comprehensiveness and quality. 1. Designing of theory of change and the impact pathway for the interventions We start with a premise that currently a detailed theory of change does not exist for the programme. Hence, a consultation will be done with the key stakeholders in the programme including the factory staff, WaterAid Bangladesh and WaterAid India staff, WaSH experts and other supply chain players to design the impact pathways. This will includ e pathways for the workers, the factory and the supply chain players. Based on this workshop, the team will draft a Theory of Change, which will be circulated to key experts for feedback. The TOC will be finalized --- Page 6 --- 6 based on feedback from them. This will be used to understand progress, design monitoring and evaluation framework and processes, analyse achievements and design the tools for field survey. 2. Field research in household and factory settings We propose mixed methods design for this evaluation. The st udy will be sequential with qualitative data collection preceding quantitative data collection. The study will employ difference in difference technique with data collection being done at baseline and endline after the programme has ended. It is currently assumed that baseline for the programme is not done and we will use recall method for creating the baseline. We propose the following calculations for ensuring that the outcomes and impact is measured and feeds back into the ROI calculations. However, t hese can be revised based on discussions with the consultants in India and Bangladesh. Power calculation for sampling will be done at the programme level. Unit of sampling for this evaluation will be workers who are exposed to the intervention in the fa ctory and in their household. The following are the assumptions for calculating the sample for quantitative data collection: 1. Confidence interval - 95% 2. Error margin - 5% 3. Dropout rate - 50% 4. Design effect - 1.2 Assuming a total of 3,000 workers across the three factories, the sample size is 620. The workers will be selected proportionately from each of the factories based on their population. For qualitative data collection, we propose to conduct group interviews in each of the factories of 10 to 15 workers each. In addition to this, in depth discussions will be done with the factory staff including senior management and clinic staff to understand the areas of enquiry and the outcomes and impact experien ced by the factories. This will also include collecting data from the factories on key indicators like: a. Attendance of workers b. Retention of workers c. Productivity of workers d. Reduced expenditure on health for the factories e. Increased repeat orders through impro ved brand image f. Reduced rejections g. Reduced reduction in expenditure for the workers and their families on health h. Sustainability of these interventions i. Access and usage of the WaSH facilities j. Behavior change among the workers --- Page 7 --- 7 This process will be followed by in depth interviews with some of key supply chain players to understand the outcomes and impact experienced by them due to the interventions. External field investigators will be employed with experience of conducting similar studies in Uttar Pradesh and in factories. Quality assurance will be done by experts as supervisors who will also be involved in conducting interviews with the senior team. This data will be analyzed to measure the outputs, outcome and impact of the programme and ROI for the fac tories and the supply chain. 3. Continuous monitoring of ROI in collaboration with the factories Based on the theory of change as designed after consultation with the key stakeholders, CMS will design a simple macro enabled excel tool which captures the imp act pathway starting from inputs at the programme level and in the factories to the key monitorable outputs at the factory tool. This tool will be administered by the CMS consultant in each of the factories every 6 months to measure the trend in progress of the interventions, progress of the outputs and hence the preliminary ROI. This will be supplemented with data from the evaluations at the worker and the household level which will provide additional outcomes and measures for ROI. The below table sum marizes the methods and tools that will be employed in this study: Sr No Level Stakeholder Tool Sample Areas to explore 1 National WaterAid, factory representatives, supply chain players Consultation NA Impact pathways for the workers, factories and supply chain players, Learnings from similar programmes 2 Factory Workers Quantitative data collection 620 across all the factories Outcomes and impact - effect on attendance, participation, health, expenditure 3 Factory Workers Group interviews 45 across all the factories in batches of 10 to 15 workers Feedback on the programme, intended and unintended outcomes of the programme 4 Factory Senior management, Nurse In depth interviews 9 individuals, 3 in each factory Outcomes and impact of the programme on factory --- Page 8 --- 8 5 Factory Senior management Secondary data NA Data on productivity, attendance, participation for each of the sampled workers and the factory overall 6 National Supply chain players In depth interviews 7 Outcomes, impact and perception of the programme among secondary and tertiary stakeholders in the supply chain 7 Factory Factory Secondary data collection All the factories every 6 months The macro enabled excel tool will be administered every 6 months in each factory to measure the preliminary ROI Budget Following are some of the assumptions for the budget: 1. Data collection at baseline and endline will be done by CMS 2. Local and national travel of the team members, including the consultant based out of Lucknow will be borne by CMS. International travel and its associated costs will be borne by WaterAid 3. The budget is for the period till April 2021 4. The cost of the national and state consultations will be supported by WaterAid The b udget summary has been presented below: Budget head Budget Summary in INR Budget Summary in USD Professional Charges 2,725,000 38,929 Field expenses 1,240,900 17,727 Inter City Travel 629,000 8,986 Local Conveyance 184,000 2,629 Other Costs - - Institutional Overheads 477,890 6,827 Sub Total 5,256,790 75,097 Goods and Service Tax 946,222 13,517 Total: 6,203,012 88,614 Please note that this is tentative based on the proposed approach.

    <Content>--- Page 1 --- Introduction The Apparel sector is one of the biggest contributors of air and water pollution both at the pre and post-consumer stages; the massive size (Bauer &amp;amp; Jagasia, 2019) of the sector exaggerates the problem further . Current apparel supply chain is not sustainable owing to its linear (Centre for Responsible Business &amp;amp; Novozymes) nature and has proven to be extremely resource intensive and inefficient (Kenniskaarten). They do not have transparent traceability mechanisms which can be uniformly applied across the sector - thereby compromising on the sustainability as well as ethical standards of garment production. Traceability in the apparel sector becomes all the more important since the lifecycle of the product right from raw material to post-consumer waste, travels across multiple geographies, manufacturing sites and agents, and very often traverses opaque and distrustful networks. (Patel, Thomas, &amp;amp; Pore, 2018).” Across the globe, the shift to circular models have emerged as the solution to the challenges in the current supply chain for improved resource utilization, and reduction in pollution. The transition, though inevitable, lacks empirical evidence around the strategic shifts for incorporating circular supply chains models. Uncertainty around the implication for stakeholders, consumer behaviors, reduction in production add to barriers towards regenerative change. The entire idea of circularity in the apparel sector is nascent for South Asian production countries like India. Policies in these nations are focused on addressing manufacturing challenges like those of infrastructure, automation etc., not realizing the need for a strategic shift in perspective towards their businesses. International non-profits, foundations and civil society organizations have triggered the conversation in the global west with some replicable and scalable pilots. However , efforts towards transition in South Asian production nations are still new, without support from the government so far. --- Page 2 --- Desk Research In the age of rising consumerism, the idea of casual purchasing has picked up and is referred to as ‘retail therapy’. While added social desires and identity connotations to clothing have driven the fast fashion trend, it has only resulted in damaging consequences for the environment (Armstrong,, Niinimaki, Lang, &amp;amp; Kujala, 2016). Present supply chain of ‘take-make-dispose’ relies on cheap and easily available inputs which are wasteful and unsustainable in nature and has led to the need for closing the loop for resource efficiency and minimizing pollution (Jørgensen, Jacob, &amp;amp; Pedersen, 2018). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) highlighted that circular economy emphasizes on product, component and material reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repair and upgrading to alternative energy sources throughout the value chain (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2013; Centre for Responsible Business &amp;amp; Novozymes). Industry leaders and policy makers have pioneered the circular economy approach within the apparel and textile sector for making it more resource efficient and sustainable. Engagement in sustainability has deepened during the COVID-19 crisis, with European consumers wanting fashion players to act responsibly and consider the social and environmental impacts of their businesses. As a result, 65 percent of respondents are planning to purchase more durable fashion items, and 71 percent are planning to keep the items they already have for longer (Granskog, Lee, Magnus, &amp;amp; Sawers, 2020). Studies across the world have time and again surfaced consumers attitudes towards their willingness to adopt circular models. In a 2019 global survey (Amed, et al., 2019), industry respondents said that pre-owned goods and rental goods were 44 percent and 41 percent more relevant in fashion, respectively . Numbers for the resale industry also indicate 25 times faster growth than the overall retail industry in 2019-with 5 times more growth in the next 5 years. Similarly , the markets for secondhand garment are projected to produce twice the current market, in the next 5 years. A ThredUp study (Thred Up, 2020) found that 64% percent of women bought or are willing to buy resold fashion pieces. This trend is being intensified by COVID-19. While the west is gradually adopting more circular models in their operations, India and other manufacturing countries of South Asia lack the business outlook and policy push. A CRB study (Centre for Responsible Business &amp;amp; Novozymes) highlights the lack of understanding of circular economy by Indian manufacturers and suppliers-‘circularity being used interchangeably with general sustainability and environmental measures.’ The study further highlights that government policies have not yet focused on providing infrastructural support for incentivizing waste management to begin with. On the one hand, the shift is bolstered by a declining preference for &amp;quot;newness&amp;quot;; while on the other , consumer behavior in India and other South Asian countries is not reflected. Consumer preference in these countries is driven by “aspiration-based buying” rather than “need- based” due to the increase in incomes of the domestic consumer and growing market (Invest India, 2020) --- Page 3 --- Additionally , transition to new modes of production and incorporation of new materials further opens a window for apprehension among all players in the supply chain, making information dissemination key to retaining the trust of stakeholders one is transacting (Fung Global Institute, 2013). In a recent survey (Mckinsey , 2019) conducted by McKinsey 52 percent of millennials and 45 percent of Gen Z reported that they always research for background information before buying a product, implying how transparency in the supply chain will become core to business operations. However , “radical transparency” may also lead to challenges related to disclosure of trade secrets like those of pricing. Although end-to-end product traceability is a key enabler in mainstreaming circularity in the industry , the growth of misinformation may make it difficult for brands to control their online presence and for consumers to ascertain the truth from the fake, contrarily eroding the trust placed in brands. Research Objectives 1. Gather perspectives on the quality of jobs in the fashion industry of roles that will change and those that will increase (in terms of numbers of jobs available) in the transition to circularity (e.g. repair , recycling, logistics). In particular , we aim to understand the perspectives and experiences of the most vulnerable groups of workers working in circular activities. In India, this specifically means these groups: [CMS to insert details here] 2. Deepen understanding of how circular jobs look today and, in the future, to identify potential positive and negative impacts on workers&amp;#x27; rights and well-being. 3. Perceptions of workers in “traditional” garment supply chains to capture their understanding of the transition to circular fashion, how this might impact their job prospects, and their awareness of new economic and reskilling opportunities. Methodology The study attempts to capture the apparel ecosystem in India with a focus on inclusive transition to circularity . It adopted a mixed methods exploratory approach with quantitative data collected from worker surveys and qualitative interactions with key stakeholders in the apparel and textile industry . While the worker surveys focused on understanding the current working condition, job security and alternative opportunities based on the OECD job quality framework, the high-level in-depth interactions with key stakeholders focused on understanding the macro level implications, enablers and barriers for large scale transition. Worker Surveys 96 workers New Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), Gujrat, Karnataka --- Page 4 --- Key Informant Interviews 15 stakeholders Stakeholders from across India and global representatives ● Research questions ● Research design ● Instruments ● Sample: detail explanation of the demographics (based in the profile of the respondent) ● Data collection ● Data analysis ● Limitations Results The understanding of circularity in India has largely been restricted to post-consumer waste for a long time. However , for India, being a manufacturing and recycling economy , the implications were a lot more. Devyani Hari from Centre for Responsible Business explained how the policy landscape in India has been slow to capitalize on the circular transition in the apparel sector . The misalignment between policies at the state and center , irregular change in regulations, lack of incentives for manufacturers and implementation challenges have impeded transition at multiple levels. Stakeholders across the value chain highlighted how India has always had a rich culture of recycling, tailoring, and upcycling garments. The study focused on understanding getting back --- Page 5 --- to slow and sustainable fashion impact livelihoods of those involved in the conventional garment production. The worker surveys and key informant interviews focused on gathering insights on the current state, challenges, opportunities in the job for traditional garment workers and recommendations for smooth and inclusive transition. Job Demand This section focuses on understanding the physical, emotional, and financial requirements of the current job that the workers are involved in. Majority of the workers (80%) perceive a threat to their safety due to the nature of the job however only 46% acknowledged wearing safety gear. Female workers perceived a higher threat as compared to men. Most workers (&amp;gt;85%) had knowledge about the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) but lacked clarity regarding the processes and procedures to be followed. Even the ones who claimed to be aware of the processes seem to access it only their supervisors. Factory units have installed secret ballots for workers to submit their complaints, but the ecosystem is not enabling enough for them to use it with less hesitance. Perception of workers related to safety at work has been negative, with 47% workers reported having experienced threat to their safety ‘ many times ’. Female garment workers recorded a total of 28% “yes, many times” and 9% responding to “yes, few times”. A total of 43% workers in the recycling sector recorded high risk of accidents in their jobs with 28% male and 15% females’ workers. This was followed by 28% workers recording exposure to noise and vibration as the second highest risk. Female respondents in the recycling category recorded equal risk of accidents and exposure to potentially dangerous chemicals at 15% each. Male workers in recycling recorded the highest response of 28% around the risk of accidents. Among the farmers, 91% of the respondents, with 52% women farmers recorded experienced threat to safety during work. In terms of physical demands, carrying loads and heavy loads recorded the highest response with 47% farmers. Between male and female farmers, 43% males’ farmers reported carrying heavy loads and 26% female farmers reported repetitive hand or arm movements as the most pressing physical demands. --- Page 6 --- Workers across the board have varying responses to “not getting enough rest or sleep in the past 30 days”. While the overall numbers recorded only 26% of the respondents agreed to not sleeping or resting enough for more than 7 days. Among them, .13.5% and 6.25% workers did not get enough sleep between 3-5 days and 1-2 days in the last 1 month, respectively . Workers did acknowledge the need of safety gear in executing their work, but those who use it comprised of more than half of the workers in the sample. Given the exposure of physically stressful needs of their jobs, across the various categories of workers, 81% said that their jobs required them to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or some safety gear to carry out their duties at work. However , only 46% workers reported having used the safety gear “Always”, 7% reported that they used it “sometimes”, while 10% of the workers said that they “never” wear any safety gear. In many cases, it was observed by the research team that the factory infrastructure was designed in a manner that it ensured maximum safety for workers like keeping sharp objects like scissors attached to the tables, that workers in their responses got a chance to reflect upon. Another interesting finding around the knowledge of health facilities, in most cases a physical clinic, recorded higher awareness among women workers (39%) as compared to male workers(28%). Among garment workers, incidents of loss of sleep for more than 7 days were reported at 40.5%, while that for the recycling group of workers, it was reported at 8.7%. 13% respondents among the recyclers also reported having lost sleep for 3-5 days in the past month. Only 12% agreed having experienced harassment at the workplace, while 88% responded no to any such experiences. Out of the 12%, 6% were men and 3% were female workers. Instances of harassment were recorded higher among recyclers (13%) as compared to garment workers (9%). On an average, workers work for about 48 hours a week. The work hours are fixed from 6-8 hours a day with provision for compensation for additional hours. However , workers do not seem to have a choice when asked to work overtime despite family commitments and physical strain. Worker ’s part of the survey reported that manufacturers do provide some flexibility in terms of availing leaves with little or no power to change their starting and ending of their work hours. Key stakeholders during their interaction also highlighted that the short life of manual workers since a lot of their work strains the eyes or the back. They emphasized on the need for fair payment to the workers since more of them in the 50s tend to move out of the jobs due to inability to do physical work. --- Page 7 --- Job Satisfaction The workers part of the study seemed content with their working conditions and environment. The acknowledgement of health facilities, resting spaces, ESI health insurance, sick leaves etc. accounted for their high satisfaction levels at work. Responses related to job satisfaction were polarizing across the groups of workers. 26% workers involved in farming reported “extreme satisfaction” with their work. This could be owed to the relatively more entrepreneurial nature of their work, as compared to garment workers and recyclers. 30% recyclers who reported that they were “satisfied” and 11% who reported “extremely satisfied” seem to have skewed the overall results because most of them comprise of contractually employed waste pickers and collectors who had more say in their jobs as compared to the other group of workers who were employed under a permanent contract. Though the results for job satisfaction look promising, it could be misleading in multiple ways. While workers do speak about the uncertain job arrangement, poor and irregular wages, their interpretation of job satisfaction appears to be restricted to how good they feel about doing the job and not about the conditions at the workplace. Among factory workers, a total of 5% workers reported dissatisfaction with the workplace. Workers asked about whether they felt that their dignity and wellbeing was respected at the workplace, the responses to which were recorded on a scale ranging between “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” 42% and 52% workers responded with “Strongly agree “and” Agree” respectively . The perspective of workers about their workplace maps to their immediate group of reference that they regularly engage --- Page 8 --- with and the relationships and conflict they have with them. While cotton farmers on the whole reported high level of satisfaction with their pace of work, those particularly involved in organic cotton farming raised concerns about the profitability of the same. 44% of the male farmers said that they did not find organic cotton profitability because the immediately next value chain player did not recognize the value of the organic produce but also compared it with the strength and staple length of the conventional cotton. Women farmers however , appeared to be more cognizant of the in-kind profitability of organic cotton with 32% of them agreeing to the benefits it brings forth. The study further explored how secure the workers felt under their current jobs. In response to this, 76% workers responded that it was highly unlikely for them to lose their jobs in the next months. However , when probed to understand the likelihood of finding a job like their current role, 44% workers said that it was unlikely for them to find a job similar to their current one (15.3% very unlikely , 28.8% unlikely .) These findings could be interpreted in correlation with the fact that the view of the worker has been restricted to their immediate family and peers at work who in most circumstances would be in similar or worse conditions. Opportunities for workers While workers do get opportunities to grow within their line of work, barriers like education and age deter further promotions, thus saturating their opportunities after a while. Most garment workers join at entry level as a helper or on a contractual basis and have opportunities to move up the ladder based on their experience, skill and competencies (from on-the-job training) to higher levels including supervisory roles. Few responses also reported of taking up roles as per the changing requirements at the workplace. They suggested that workers&amp;#x27; roles can also be changed by speaking with their supervisors. Career advancement was largely understood as promotions at the workplace. 70% of the respondents reported having received career advancement opportunities in the form of promotions. It was found that 60% of the respondents received 1 promotion at their current workplace, while 15% received it twice. It was observed that women often tend to do better in moving ahead in their career due to better interpersonal skills, and relationship building with other colleagues. 39% of the female respondents and 30% of the male respondents reported getting promoted. Those who recorded no promotion belong to the younger age category , with less than 5 years of experience at the workplace. Qualitative interactions also revealed that transition will differently impact different communities. It emerged that while jobs in the energy sector may not be as highly impacted since it will focus on more conscious choices related to cleaner and more efficient energies. Stakeholders currently working on waste management and recycling also emphasized that --- Page 9 --- while the number of jobs for workers in this sector may not change as much, the nature and working conditions will only improve for the better . Recyclers further highlighted how the jobs for low skilled women workers will only increase soon for segregation and sorting roles, since employers find women to be more skillful in these manual roles as compared to male workers. (This insight aligns itself with the economic model developed by the university of Lincoln. In fact, the need for strengthening the social safety mechanisms for those involved in production using virgin products will The perception of different workers including recyclers, permanent operators and contractual operators was also studied. About 60% of the workers across categories reported that they believe that the job provided them with opportunity to learn and grow . About 70% of the respondents reported that they believe that the men and women have similar opportunities at the workplace. Most informal workers and home-based workers are subcontracted by manufacturers and paid by the piece rate system. The home-based workers comprise 5 millions of the total workforces 1 in the industry and are often left behind with no job security and social protection coverage neither from the employer because of subcontracting provisions, nor from community institutions for they fall way too low in the social ladder . ReFashion Hub run by the mayurbhanj foundation works on the initiative called the Karkhana Chronicles tries to support and bring the traditional artisans and craftsmen to the mainstream. Similarly , SEW A Bharat, another collaborator that works with home-based workers through a producer company model through its Ruaab initiative. Ruaab SEW A represents a unique model of garment production and sourcing that is owned and managed by women producers, which ensures an ethical and transparent supply chain. The company has nine board members, six are the producers themselves, two are representatives of SEW A and one is independent. SEW Abharat handholds the workers for reskilling and provides B2B market linkage. Anohita Sharma shared how collectivization into the producer company exposes these workers to like-minded brands like GAP, NEXT , New Look, Monsoon, Max, Zara, Vero Moda, Mango, Lindex, Peacock , in order to promote their livelihoods. She also shared how the ETI’s time and motion is used to 2 quote the rates to exporters, thereby preventing any stress or exploitation. It further emerged from the study that the demand for artisanal workers using hand work and natural fiber requires high maintenance, thus making it expensive. This has been the reason for the small and niche market base for artisanal products. It is to curb this challenge of limited outreach that Sharma suggests shifting the focus from luxury products to skilling workers for more utility products that can provide them with enough and regular earnings. 2 Ruaab’s sampling team applies ETI’s ‘time and motion’ study as a tool to quote an accurate rate for the exporters. This is the process of finding out the actual time taken by the workers in completing a particular embroidery pattern as per the sample provided by the exporter. https://sewadelhi.org/ruaab-sewa/ 1 Marlese von Broembsen, The world’s most vulnerable garment workers aren’t in factories – and global brands need to step up to protect them, WEIGO 2020 --- Page 10 --- The recycling supply chain in India is fragmented and relies heavily on informal waste pickers, collectors, and segregators. The giant recycling units are mostly family run businesses that have been operational over years. The core workers within the recycling units are women involved in sorting and segregating waste, while those involved in actual waste processing are more skilled workers with technical expertise. The categorization between the two strata is stringent with little or no scope for those in the lower ranks to learn and climb up the ladder . The study also revealed that even these workers employed within the recycler units work on contractual agreements, thus making them more vulnerable and susceptible to crisis in case of any shock or disaster . Traditional garment workers employed in the factory units are far more secure and are more exposed to potential opportunities for growth. They have basic social protection coverage and stable salaries every month. Their perception of growth is, however , constrained to their line of command. Factory workers, both in traditional garment manufacturing and recycling do not see alternative opportunities outside of their sector , since most of them take up this work by virtue of belonging to communities or families wherein older generations have built a rapport with the employer and feel obliged to work under them for generations. Skilled workers will be relatively well placed with opportunities and better access to pathways to transition, it is felt that semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the manufacturing sector are likely to lose due to lack of awareness about reskilling or the opportunities and access to undertake these training. Informal workers in the recycling space and waste pickers are unprotected and will be left behind if not for reskilling and training opportunities. The demand for organic cotton quality looks upbeat in the medium to long term despite requirements of virgin materials likely to reduce multifold. However , the quality standards are expected to be high and the fragmented nature of agriculture, lack of awareness and training amongst small farmers will be a barrier to tap the demand potential. Worker surveys suggest that while technology is introduced in their place of work, they are not exposed, reskilled, or re-trained around it and a new set of technical experts get to use and work with the new machines. In terms of the future of work and reskilling, worker surveys suggested that most of them are not exposed to the opportunities available or even envisage any major changes around the nature of their work. Mainstreaming indigenous artisans through training and capacity strengthening is the need of the hour. People involved in hand embroidery and stitching will have increased skills that can be absorbed better in the circular business models. --- Page 11 --- Worker voices and representation Workers across the board were asked questions about their representation, association and participation at the workplace. This section aimed at exploring the hypothesis that workers in India are poorly represented with little or no power to unionize and leverage the power of collective bargaining. Workers were asked whether they know of any union in their factory , or region to which 46% responded positively . The others did not know of any labor union around them. When asked about the membership in unions, workers working at the designation of operator appeared to have the most exposure and chance of unionization. Workers lower in the strata reported both high levels of ignorance and lack of association opportunities. Findings in this section also differed by the gender of workers. Overall, female workers seemed to have shared better relationships with their peers and supervisors. When asked whether workers shared work related problems with their supervisors, only 66% workers said “yes”. Out of the 66%, 42% were women. This was followed up by questions related to their perception about inclusive decision making and goal setting. the statement “I am consulted before my targets are set” was put to the respondents. 10% of female workers “strongly agreed”, followed by 40% of them “agreeing”. The rest of the women either recorded a “neutral” response (3%) or said that they “do not set targets” (6%). The results for this could also be attributed to the bias they have with higher sense of belongingness and indebtedness to their employers. Workers in the recycling segment as well as those holding higher designations in the factory units reported positive responses when asked about their ability to influence decisions that are important for their work. However , there was higher dissatisfaction reported in the way their opinions are considered. Workers have always had the fear of bearing the brunt for speaking out by losing their jobs or wages. Weak and deterring policies around unionization has further aggravated the situation for workers. --- Page 12 --- Workers involved in organic cotton farming highlighted how collectivization enabled them to take up organic farming not only in terms of knowledge and awareness but also the techniques and input support that individuals would have found more challenging to access. On being asked about the conflict resolution mechanism at work, farmers reported various informal channels like reaching out to the village head (20%), informal negotiation (20%), elderly members in the family and community (16%), direct employer on the field (4%) and police (4%). Considering that large scale transition to circular models will reduce production of conventional cotton and increase organic cotton production formal grievance redressal mechanisms and formation of farmer producer companies for collective bargaining power to ensure just transition. Interactions with members form the labor unions also highlighted how the post pandemic times hold a bigger challenge for factory workers because of rising cases of harassment and human rights exploitation. It was mentioned that limited workforce, and increased demands from the brands and the need for manufacturers to meet their targets has left workers more exploited than ever. President of one of the worker unions highlighted the need for intervention by worker unions along with other stakeholders to safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable workers including women and the aged. She further highlighted how workers themselves do not want to associate themselves with the unions because of the constrained perception about their protest and fear of losing jobs if they stand by the union. Other international labor rights organizations further emphasized on the need to build trust among workers and with their management. --- Page 13 --- Alternative Job Opportunities In the context of large-scale transition from traditional garment manufacturing to more circular models, the objective of this section was to understand areas that workers currently see as alternative opportunities, both within the apparel industry and outside. It emerged from the study that workers do not have any perception about any alternative job they could be doing. 77% workers from the surveys said that they have never considered working outside of their present roles and sector . Workers further explained that they get involved in different roles within the sector by virtue of their birth in particular families or communities. They end up working in the sector because this has been carrying on for generations. Aspiration for the future also emerged to be quite low among workers across the board. In ten years&amp;#x27; time 78% of the workers see themselves in the same position as today . Those who look forward to advancement can only think of their immediate line supervisors’. On further probing and listing potential opportunities, a significant number of workers were interested in starting their own businesses. Majority of women workers were also interested in entrepreneurship opportunities. The major reason holding the workers back was the lack of financial capital and business skills. In terms of transition in the sector , traditional garment workers do not foresee any loss of jobs in the next six months. This is aligned with the views of stakeholders who mentioned that mainstreaming circular models would be difficult unless large-scale demand is reached. Nohar from Kiabza and Kischo highlighted how the fashion system has failed to capture the affordability angle in sustainable clothing. For consumers, a more expensive garment, which is --- Page 14 --- of a lesser quality than virgin product is something that is still confusing. Unless markets are able to tap into consumer behavior , consciousness towards sustainable clothing along with affordability , reaching economies of scale would be challenging even beyond the next decade. Trainings regarding health and safety of workers were organized at the workplace. Apart from this, the trainings also included topics like rights, anti-discrimination at workplace and soft skills. It was clearly found that the women workers were more receptive towards capacity building and training. 65% of the women reported that they believe that training would help them secure better job opportunities. 34% of the women reported that their duties corresponded with their skill. This figure was only 7% among the male respondents. Women workers feel more positive and aspirational about their work in the sector . Out of 41% workers who said that their skills correspond with their duties, 34% were women. Need for further training also emerged with 32% workers pointing towards the same. 21% of the female respondents expressed that they need further training to deliver on their duties. 11% of the male respondents reported requiring any further training. Despite their willingness to upgrade themselves on various skills, 77% workers said that they have not considered working outside of their present roles/sector . 78% of the workers see themselves in the same position as today . This is largely due to uncertainty and lack of capital to undertake any self-employment ventures. 66% respondents said they wanted to &amp;#x27;start their own business&amp;#x27; but were held back by the lack of investment and business skills. Fashion experts and stakeholders currently working in circular models do not anticipate a major shift in the next decade. Initiatives within the sector will take place in small pockets if the transition happens at the current pace, with no major impact on jobs and earnings. Representative of a major rental platform expressed that if circular models get adopted at large scale, “It will have a somewhat similar impact as ride hailing services had on mobility . They increased mobility and new opportunities. Similarly circular fashion will create more opportunities for the skilled workers and business environment.” He further spoke of the change in supply chains and interaction between the consumption and production countries” but there will be new and more opportunities rather than shrinking of opportunities.” Stakeholders&amp;#x27; interactions with those already working on various circular models like recycling are opposed to the hypothesis that automation will act as a disruptor and impact livelihoods of traditional workers. They believe that while automation may make work more efficient, a lot of stitching work will still require human resources. They do not feel that automation will be so sophisticated that it would be able to transform the entire chain of production. --- Page 15 --- Recommendations While the low cost of labor is an opportunity for India to capitalise for fast tracking circular initiatives within the apparel sector , it will be important to ensure that the quality of jobs improve, both in terms of labor rights and as well as overall social protection coverage. With respect to the formal sector , the factory management needs to build more trust with their workers. Improving grievance redressal mechanism for workers in the workplace. While workers have knowledge of the committees in place, the process of approaching the committee is not clear to the workers. It emerged that workers were hesitant of being recognized and using the secret ballots in the few factories that had these mechanisms. Workers are extremely dependent on their line supervisors. While this seems to have worked in most cases, creating more open forums to voice their concerns will not only help reduce the pressure from the supervisor but also prevent chances of exploitation of workers in the hands of the supervisors themselves. While the formal sector still has some mechanisms for worker wellbeing and social protection, the information on the working in the informal sector is unavailable or very scanty in the secondary literature. Our experience in some interactions with labor rights organizations and worker associations tells us that they are highly vulnerable to livelihood and income shocks due to the precarious nature of demand from the manufacturers and absence of transparency in the value chain. There is uncertainty on the availability of work, no minimum wages standards, social protection benefits etc. for these workers. The absence of data on the informal sector workers is perhaps the biggest gap, leading to lack of information in identifying their status and how the situation can be improved for them. At the ecosystem level, an integrated approach towards improving working conditions has to be adopted that involves interventions at the policy , system and behavioural level. Strengthening social protection systems particularly for the informal and contractual workers to enable them and build their resilience for surviving demand shocks and other disruption of the gig economy . There would also be more opportunities emerging for artisanal handicrafts that would require reskilling of the workers to understand the designing requirements and trends in the market. Skilling and capacity building would also include training on soft skills thereby empowering them for change readiness. Allowing and enabling workers and farmers the freedom to associate and make room for collective bargaining. This would ensure improved participation of workers at the workplace. Small and marginal farmers need to be skilled on organic farming and climate smart agriculture practices including support on certifications, value chain and market linkages. An industry road map for skilling also needs to be developed for the farmers in production of organic cotton due to the fragmented nature of the agriculture sector and lack of awareness amongst the small --- Page 16 --- and marginal farmers. Further , smooth transition would also require the support of labor organizations working closely with the workers would be crucial in identifying training and reskilling opportunities. The innovations in recycling, repair and rental models are driven in isolation and the integration of circular models is at a very nascent stage. Support from policy makers, ecosystem players will be very crucial in incentivizing stakeholders to transition sooner and better for advancing these industries. The country requires a strategic approach to understand and adopt circular models of garment production at scale. Lack of evidence and data around workers got highlighted in recent times during the pandemic. Smooth and inclusive transition will require further research and pilot of models to accurately estimate the impact and its nature on livelihoods.</Content>
